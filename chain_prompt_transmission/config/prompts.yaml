    You are an extremely thorough analytical assistant.
        
    Systematically check the article text below for any statements that suggest, imply, or explicitly assert that bird flu virus has the potential to, IN THE FUTURE, become more transmissible to humans, start to spread/transmit human-to-human, or become a pandemic.

    Examples of statements to include:

    "We might have an influenza pandemic." <- [Potential future pandemic]

    "H5N1 is a virus that scientists fear might one day trigger a pandemic." <- [Potential future pandemic]

    "The flu strain historically has posed almost no risk to humans, but public experts remain concerned about the possibility that it could jump across species." <- [Potential future increased transmissibility to humans]

    "It's abundantly clear that no one knows for sure where bird flu is heading: Will it be confined to cattle, or will it spread to other species, including humans?" <- [Potential future increased transmissibility to humans]

    "We need to be investing in pandemic preparedness." <- [Implied potential future pandemic]

    "There is surprisingly inadequate surveillance, limited testing capacity, and a dangerous lack of access to health care in the rural regions that are most likely to be initially affected if H5N1 spills over into humans." <- [Potential future increased transmissibility to humans]

    "One of the things we learned in Covid is that you need to have established relationships before there is any sort of public health emergency." <- [Implied potential future pandemic through Covid comparison]

    "I sat with members of Congress in meeting after meeting educating them all on the potential that this was out there and showing them we had a virus that was transmitting between animals, and that we now had cases where they've gone from animals to people." <- [Potential future increased transmissibility to humans by extrapolating from recent alleged increases in transmissibility, with emphasis on 'potential', implying more increases]

    "The bird flu outbreak is "concerning, but we can't yet say whether it's going to really become a major problem that the public at large needs to worry about," Eisenberg said. "It's enough of a concern that we should certainly be doing everything we can to make sure that it doesn't turn into a bigger problem."" <- [Potential future increased transmissibility to humans]

    "The outbreak could be halted before the virus evolved into a form that could spread readily between humans." <- [Potential future increased human-to-human transmission]

affirm_transmissible_contextualize:
  description: "Contextualize extracted statements"
  prompt: |
    You are an extremely thorough analytical assistant.

    Below you will find:
    1. The original fulltext article
    2. A list of statements extracted from that article that explain scientific/biological/epidemiological mechanisms for bird flu transmission or pandemic potential

    For each statement in the list:
    1. Locate it within the fulltext
    2. Examine the surrounding sentences (before and after)
    3. If the surrounding sentences provide important additional context that helps explain the mechanism or makes the explanation more complete, **extract ONLY those newly appended context sentences** (not the original statement) and place them into the `context_added` array. (New Instruction)
    4. If the surrounding context doesn't add meaningful information about the mechanism, leave the statement unchanged.

    Output format should be a JSON object with three arrays:
    1. "context_added": Statements where additional context was found, but **only** the newly appended portion (not the original statement). (New Instruction)
    2. "unchanged": Original statements where no additional context was needed
    3. "all_statements": Combined pool of both context-only entries and unchanged statements

    For example:

    Input statement: "The virus was mutating fairly rapidly in animals."

    If the fulltext contains:
    "Scientists monitored the outbreak closely. The virus was mutating fairly rapidly in animals, specifically in populations of wild birds where constant transmission allowed for quick evolution. This raised concerns about adaptation to new hosts."

    The JSON output would include:
    - In context_added: "specifically in populations of wild birds where constant transmission allowed for quick evolution. This raised concerns about adaptation to new hosts."  
      *(Rather than embedding the original statement again, we only place the appended snippet in `context_added`.)*
    - In unchanged: [would not include this statement since context was added]
    - In all_statements: The appended context snippet plus any unchanged statements.

    More examples:

      Input statement: "This is an infection that has epidemic and pandemic potential."
      Fulltext: "This is an infection that has epidemic and pandemic potential. I don’t know if people recognize how big a deal this is."
      Output: "I don’t know if people recognize how big a deal this is."
      Explanation: Context emphasized the risk, so it goes in context_added.

      Input statement: "This outbreak signals the very real potential for the emergence of mammal-to-mammal transmission."
      Fulltext: "This outbreak signals the very real potential for the emergence of mammal-to-mammal transmission. None of the workers, who wore protective gear, at the farm seem to have gotten infected. But some scientists worry that minks could be a kind of stepping stone for the virus to make a jump to humans."
      Output: "None of the workers, who wore protective gear, at the farm seem to have gotten infected. But some scientists worry that minks could be a kind of stepping stone for the virus to make a jump to humans."
      Explanation: Context about minks is appended.

      Input statement: "This is a clear mechanism for an H5 pandemic to start."
      Fulltext: "This is a clear mechanism for an H5 pandemic to start. 'This is incredibly concerning,' Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London, told Science Magazine. He also noted that minks’ respiratory systems make them particularly good host species for viruses that can infect humans."
      Output: "'This is incredibly concerning,' Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London, told Science Magazine. He also noted that minks’ respiratory systems make them particularly good host species for viruses that can infect humans."
      Explanation: Additional text about minks is appended.

      Input statement: "An Even Deadlier Pandemic Could Soon Be Here."
      Fulltext: "An Even Deadlier Pandemic Could Soon Be Here. Journalist Zeynep Tufekci, who has extensively covered the COVID-19 pandemic, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece published this week titled 'An Even Deadlier Pandemic Could Soon Be Here.' She also spoke to Peacock, who noted that minks’ respiratory systems make them particularly good host species for viruses that can infect humans."
      Output: "Journalist Zeynep Tufekci, who has extensively covered the COVID-19 pandemic, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece published this week titled 'An Even Deadlier Pandemic Could Soon Be Here.' She also spoke to Peacock, who noted that minks’ respiratory systems make them particularly good host species for viruses that can infect humans."
      Explanation: Additional context about Tufekci’s commentary is appended.

      Input statement: "I really do think it's very likely that we will, at some time it's not a question of if, it's more of a question of when we will have a bird flu pandemic."
      Fulltext: "I really do think it's very likely that we will, at some time it's not a question of if, it's more of a question of when we will have a bird flu pandemic. A wide variety of mammals have been found harboring the virus including cows, cats, ferrets and elephant seals."
      Output: "A wide variety of mammals have been found harboring the virus including cows, cats, ferrets and elephant seals."
      Explanation: Additional snippet appended.

      Input statement: "And as I said, I think it's just a matter of time."
      Fulltext: "And as I said, I think it's just a matter of time. Another expert expressed similar concern."
      Output: "Another expert expressed similar concern."
      Explanation: Additional snippet appended.

    Original Fulltext: {fulltext}
    Extracted Statements: {statements_list}

    IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS TASK:

    1. For each input statement_id, ONLY replace "extract" with "contextualize" while preserving its numeric suffix. For example, if the input statement_id was "affirm_transmissible_statement_extract_1", your output statement_id must be "affirm_transmissible_statement_contextualize_1". Do not skip or reorder IDs.

    2. For each input statement, you must output exactly one contextualized statement, **preserving the numeric suffix** in its statement_id. For instance, "affirm_transmissible_statement_extract_2" must become "affirm_transmissible_statement_contextualize_2". Do not skip or merge any statements.

    3. Even if a statement’s text appears (partly or wholly) in the contextualization for a previous statement, you must **still** produce a separate contextualized version for it. That is, each input statement should have its own unique output entry, even if that leads to some repetition of text.

    4. The final JSON must contain exactly N entries in the "individual_statements" array, in the **same order** as the input. If you detect overlap between statement #i and #i+1, do not combine or delete any statement; simply provide repeated context if necessary.

    5. Failure to produce a 1:1 correspondence between the extracts and the contextualized statements (same item count and IDs) violates these instructions.

affirm_transmissible_trim:
  description: "Remove unneeded added context from contextualized statements"
  prompt: |
    You are an extremely thorough analytical assistant.

    You are provided with two sets of statements:
    1) "original_extract": The original statements extracted from the article
    2) "context_added": Longer statements in which additional context was appended around each original statement

    Your task:
    1. For each pair (original_extract[i], context_added[i]), decide if the extra contextual sentences in context_added[i] are relevant:
       - If they fail the trim criteria below, remove them.
       - If they pass, keep them in place.
       - If *all* of the added context is removed, you revert to using just the original_extract text.
    2. Apply the following exclusion criteria and exclusion examples to the appended context:

        Exclusion criteria:
       - The context added is not relevant to the original extract.
       - The context added is not a scientific explanation of the mechanism for bird flu transmission.
       - The context added is not a statement about the future potential for bird flu to become more transmissible to humans.

        Exclusion examples:

      Original extract: "The virus would have to go through genetic changes that allow it to better bind to human receptors for it to start spreading between people, Adalja explained."
      Context added: "If you are worried about eating food products from sick animals, know that pasteurized milk is not affected. Cooking your meat to the right temperature will kill off the flu virus if it happens to be there, according to Bowman." [<- Filtered out because this is advice, not a mechanism or explanation for potential increased future transmissibility to humans.]

      Original extract: "The virus would have to go through genetic changes that allow it to better bind to human receptors for it to start spreading between people, Adalja explained."
      Context added: "If you are worried about eating food products from sick animals, know that pasteurized milk is not affected. Cooking your meat to the right temperature will kill off the flu virus if it happens to be there, according to Bowman." [<- Filtered out because this is advice, not a mechanism or explanation for potential increased future transmissibility to humans.]

      Original extract: "Experts worry about the possibility of an H5N1 pandemic among humans, warning that the lack of clear and timely updates on the outbreak by some federal agencies, including failures to provide updates on the spread of H5N1 in cows and the safety of milk supplies, is reflective of the miscommunication steps at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Washington Post reported."
      Context added: 'This requires multiple agencies to coordinate and communicate internally, but most importantly externally, which doesn't seem to be happening due to different cultures, priorities, legal responsibilities, scientific expertise, and agility,' epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina, who has closely tracked the avian flu outbreak, told the Post. 'Mix that in with the usual challenges of scientific uncertainty, complexity and, quite frankly global pressure, and you got yourself an utterly, unacceptable mess.' [<- Filtered out because this is a statement about the current situation (policy response), not a mechanism or explanation for potential increased future transmissibility to humans.]

      Original extract: "Redfield said scientists have found that the bird flu virus hasn't yet adapted to spread from humans to humans, but that once it does, 'that's when you're going to have the pandemic.'"
      Context added: "Redfield said scientists have found that the bird flu virus hasn't yet adapted to spread from humans to humans, but that once it does, 'that's when you're going to have the pandemic.' The Hill reported." [<- Filtered out because "The Hill reported" is not a mechanism or explanation for potential increased future transmissibility to humans.]

      Original extract: "The virus appears to be contained to farms, but there's always a chance it could develop mutations that let it spread between humans. And if that happens, we may have another pandemic on our hands."
      Context added: "'We've not seen human-to-human transmission to date and that's a saving grace,' Dr. Andrew Bowman, a veterinary epidemiologist at The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, told HuffPost." [<- Filtered out because this is a statement reassuring about current transmissibility), not a mechanism or explanation or statement about potential increased future transmissibility to humans or pandemic potential.]

    3. After applying the filter, you will have a final set of statements—some may be "original extract only," some may have context.
    4. Return **one** final statement per pair in the same order they were provided. If a piece of context is irrelevant, remove it; if *all* context is irrelevant, revert to the original extract alone.

    **Output Format Requirements**:
    ```json
    {{
      "statements": [
        "final trimmed statement 1",
        "final trimmed statement 2"
      ],
      "individual_statements": [

          "statement_id": "affirm_transmissible_statement_trim_2"
        }}
      ]
    }}
    ```

    - The `"statements"` array must match `"individual_statements"` in length and content.
    - For each final statement, the `"statement_id"` must be `"affirm_transmissible_statement_trim_<n>"`, with **ascending** numbering.
    - No other fields (like `"explanation"`) are allowed in the output.
    - Combine the original extract + valid context into **one** final statement *per pair*.

affirm_transmissible_merge:
  description: "Merge statements that overlap or repeat"
  prompt: |
    You are an extremely thorough analytical assistant.

    You have received a list of statements from the trim phase. Some of these statements may overlap or repeat text verbatim, especially around shared sentences. Your task is to:

    1) Identify any pairs (or groups) of statements that share **at least one entire sentence** (verbatim) in common.
    2) Merge each group of overlapping statements into a single combined statement by:
       - Including all unique non-overlapping sentences from each statement in the group.
       - Retaining the shared (overlapping) sentence(s) only once.
       - Preserving the original order of sentences as best as possible.
    3) Statements that do **not** overlap with any other remain standalone, unchanged.
    4) Output **only** the final set of merged (and standalone) statements. Each final statement must appear exactly once, either merged or standalone.

    **Output Format Requirements:**
    - Return a JSON object of the form:
      ```json
      {{
        "statements": [
          "final statement 1",
          "final statement 2",
          ...
        ],
        "individual_statements": [
          {{
            "statement": "final statement 1",
            "statement_id": "affirm_transmissible_statement_merge_1"
          }},
          {{
            "statement": "final statement 2",
            "statement_id": "affirm_transmissible_statement_merge_2"
          }}
        ]
      }}
      ```
    - The `"statements"` array must be **identical** in length and content to the `"individual_statements"` array.
    - For each final statement, assign a `"statement_id"` that follows the pattern `"affirm_transmissible_statement_merge_<n>"`, where `<n>` is a sequential integer (1, 2, 3, etc.).
    - **Do not** include extra fields or explanations.

affirm_transmissible_exclude_1_temporal:
  description: "Temporal exclusion of statements"
  prompt: |
    You are an extremely thorough analytical assistant.
            
    Step 1: Systematically exclude any statements that do NOT address or suggest pandemic potential or potential increased transmissibility to humans but rather only address or suggest PRESENT or IMMEDIATE risk.

    Examples of statements to exclude:

    "The current public health risk is low." <- [Current risk only]

    CLARIFICATION:
    - If a statement explicitly uses words like "pandemic potential," "possible future," or "one day might spread," then it DOES address future risk, even if part of the statement mentions current surveillance or investigation methods.

    Step 2: For each statement that PASSES ALL criteria, include it in the output numbered sequentially.

    Respond ONLY with a JSON object in the format:

    {{
      "statements": [
        "statement 1",
        "statement 2"
      ],
      "individual_statements": [

          /* "explanation": "explanation 2" <-- COMMENTED OUT */
        }}
      ]
    }}

    Statements to check: {all_statements}

    IMPORTANT: Preserve the numeric suffix from the input statement_id when forming "affirm_transmissible_statement_exclude_1_temporal_<n>". For example, if the input ID was "affirm_transmissible_statement_contextualize_3", you should output "affirm_transmissible_statement_exclude_1_temporal_3" if that statement passes the temporal filter. Do not skip or reindex IDs.

affirm_transmissible_exclude_remainder:
  description: "Additional content filter, excludes remainder statements (similar to temporal)"
  prompt: |
    You are an extremely thorough analytical assistant.

    Step 1: Systematically exclude any statements that do NOT address or suggest pandemic potential FUTURE potential increased transmissibility to humans; or that do NOT address a mechanism for increased future transmissibility or pandemic potential in humans.
    
    Example 1: "“With birds that are able to move around and airborne, this disease could spread pretty rapidly if it’s not contained very quickly,” state Sen. Emanuel Jones, whose district covers Henry County, told the station." <- [Spread rapidly among birds? This is not a statement about humans.]

    Example 2: "The avian influenza strain known as H5N1 is killing an unprecedented number of mating pairs of the national symbol birds, University of Georgia researchers concluded in a study published in Nature's Scientific Reports." <- [Current impact observation on birds, not humans.]

    Example 3: "This sector of workers is not only at the very, very highest risk because they're having that direct, intimate contact with discharge, raw milk, with infected animals, but they're also at the very, very highest level of risk in terms of having no social safety net." <- [Current risk assessment without future implications]

    Example 4:"Currently, dairy workers are among the people who are most at risk of avian influenza, and many are disempowered migrant workers who face structural barriers to accessing health care." <- [Current risk and access issues, no future implications]

    Step 2: For each statement that PASSES ALL criteria, include it in the output, numbered sequentially.

    Statements to check: {all_statements}

    IMPORTANT:
    - Preserve the numeric suffix from the input statement_id when forming "affirm_transmissible_statement_exclude_remainder_<n>". 
    - For example, if the input ID was "affirm_transmissible_statement_exclude_1_temporal_3", you should output "affirm_transmissible_statement_exclude_remainder_3" if that statement passes this filter.
    - Do not skip or reindex IDs.

  prompt: |
    You are an extremely thorough analytical assistant.

    Step 1: For each statement, determine if it addresses SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATIONS or BIOLOGICAL or EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS explaining WHY or HOW bird flu might develop this potential. If the statement does not address a mechanism, it should be excluded. If the statement mentions "mutations", "evolves" or "evolving" or "evolution" or implies such things, it should be included.

    Step 2: Sort the statements into two lists:
    1. INCLUDED - Statements that provide mechanisms
    2. EXCLUDED - Statements that don't provide mechanisms 

    Examples of statements to exclude (these should go in the EXCLUDED list):
    "We might have an influenza pandemic." <- [Potential future pandemic, but no mechanism]
    "H5N1 is a virus that scientists fear might one day trigger a pandemic." <- [Potential future pandemic, but no mechanism]

    For each statement:
    1. Locate it within the fulltext
    2. Verify that it accurately represents the content and context
    3. If the statement differs slightly from the source text, replace it with the EXACT text from the source
    4. If the statement cannot be found in the source text or differs significantly, discard it
    5. Check for any significant discrepancies or misrepresentations

    Examples of acceptable minor variations that should be corrected to source text:
    - Statement: "Scientists worry the virus might mutate to become more transmissible"
      Source: "Scientists worry the virus could mutate to become more transmissible"
      Action: Use source text version
      
    - Statement: "The virus has shown signs it could adapt to humans"
      Source: "The virus has shown signs that it could adapt to humans"
      Action: Use source text version

    Examples of unacceptable variations that should be discarded:
    - Statement: "Scientists are concerned about viral mutations"
      Source: "Scientists worry the virus could mutate to become more transmissible"
      Action: Discard (too different from source)
      
    - Statement: "Research suggests the virus might adapt to human transmission"
      Source: No close match in text
      Action: Discard (no matching source text)

    Sort the statements into categories:
    1. VALIDATED - Statements that match the source text (after correction if needed)
    2. DISCARDED - Statements with significant discrepancies or that cannot be found

    Original Fulltext: {fulltext}
    Mechanism Statements to Validate: {mechanism_statements}
    Blanket Statements to Validate: {blanket_statements}

    IMPORTANT: When you validate each statement, rename its ID from e.g. "affirm_transmissible_statement_exclude_2_mechanism_3" to either "affirm_transmissible_statement_mechanism_validated_3" (if validated) or "affirm_transmissible_statement_mechanism_discarded_3" (if discarded). Do the same for blanket statements: "affirm_transmissible_statement_blanket_validated_#" or "affirm_transmissible_statement_blanket_discarded_#". Keep the numeric suffix the same as the input statement’s numeric suffix.
