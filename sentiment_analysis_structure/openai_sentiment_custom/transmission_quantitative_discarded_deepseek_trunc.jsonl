The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a statement that the chief vets of England, Scotland and Wales had agreed the new legal requirement for all birdkeepers to bring their flocks indoors, to keep them separate from potentially infectious wild birds. The strict new lockdown-style measures, which have already been introduced in the Netherlands, apply not only to large commercial poultry farms but also smaller keepers with hens in coops or garden pens. Keepers are being urged to use the next 11 days to prepare for the new measures, including taking steps to safeguard animal welfare, consult their vet and where necessary erect additional housing or self-contained netted areas. Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as �ree-range�or 16 weeks after the birds have been brought indoors, but if the restrictions last beyond that they must be downgraded to �arn produced�sing stickers on packaging. Similarly, poultry meat can be labelled free-range for 12 weeks. To be defined as free range in the UK, a chicken must normally be at least 56 days old before slaughter and have had access to outside space for at least half that time. Premium free-range eggs currently represent 56% of UK retail egg sales �he highest proportion of any European country �hereas just 2% of eggs are from the barn system. Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser with the National Farmers�nion, urged all farmers to comply with the new rules. �ue to a number of confirmed avian influenza cases, the introduction of these new housing measures is a logical next step to best protect poultry. These new measures mean that every poultry keeper, whether you have one hen in the garden or a large poultry business, must house their birds indoors and I would urge everyone with poultry to take these measures seriously. It� crucial that everyone remains vigilant and reports any signs of disease in their birds at the earliest opportunity.� On Sunday, all 10,500 turkeys at a farm in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, were culled after an outbreak was spotted on Saturday, while a 3km (2-mile) and 10km temporary control zone was put in place to stop the disease spreading. About 13,500 birds were culled earlier this month following confirmation of an avian flu outbreak at a commercial farm in Helsby, near Frodsham in Cheshire. Defra reiterated that the risk to human health and food safety from the virus was �ery low� UK and European farmers have been on alert after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. In a joint statement, Great Britain� three chief vets said: �e have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease and are now planning to introduce a legal requirement for bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds. We have not taken this decision lightly, but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.� A spokesman for the British Egg Industry Council said: �o date there have been no cases of avian flu in free-range laying flocks; however it is vital that we continue to protect the health and welfare of the UK� laying flock and commercial poultry operations. The requirement to keep birds inside from 14 December is a further step to those already taken to continue to protect flocks.� It is the first time in four years that a so-called housing order has been imposed on the UK poultry sector due to a significant outbreak of bird flu, when measures were put in place from December 2016 to May 2017. A spokesman for Compassion in World Farming said: �e understand the reasons for bringing poultry indoors, but would urge that the period be kept as short as possible and that steps are taken to ensure the welfare of birds temporarily confined indoors.�", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "deny_statement_1", "statement": "Defra reiterated that the risk to human health and food safety from the virus was ‘very low’."}]}

Keepers have had 11 days to prepare for the strict new lockdown-style measures, including taking steps to safeguard animal welfare, consult their vet and where necessary erect additional housing or self-contained netted areas. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) announced earlier this month that the chief vets of England, Scotland and Wales had agreed the new legal requirement for all owners to bring their flocks indoors, to keep them separate from potentially infectious wild birds. It applies not only to large commercial poultry farms but also smaller farmers with hens in coops or garden pens. Lockdown and the shift towards 'self-sufficiency' has triggered a huge surge in interest by individuals in keeping birds and there is concern that many may have scant regard or understanding of the importance of biosecurity measures. The restrictions will apply to chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants. No end date for the measures has yet been given, and Defra said they would be kept under 'regular review.' Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as 'free-range' for 16 weeks from today, but if restrictions last longer they must be downgraded to 'barn produced' using stickers on packaging. Similarly, poultry meat can be labelled free-range for 12 weeks. To be defined as free range in the UK, a chicken must normally be at least 56 days old before slaughter and have had access to outside space for at least half that time. Premium free-range eggs currently represent 56% of UK retail egg sales—the highest proportion of any European country—whereas just 2% of eggs are from the barn system. It is the first time in four years that a so-called housing order has been imposed on the UK poultry sector due to a significant outbreak of bird flu, when measures were put in place from December 2016 to May 2017. Thousands of turkeys have been culled after outbreaks in North Yorkshire, Cheshire and Norfolk, while cases were confirmed this week in Warwickshire and Worcestershire after a number of dead swans were found. Among commercial producers preparing for the new restrictions is Alastaire Brice, who runs Havensfield Happy Hens—currently with 160,000 laying hens in 22 flocks across farms in Norfolk and Suffolk. The current lockdown comes as no surprise, Brice told the East Anglian Daily Times: 'It's expected, bearing in mind the sporadic cases that have been going on up and down the country. Last year, they had a reprieve when bird flu didn't arrive in the country but this year it started with a bang.' It can take longer to get older flocks to adjust to coming indoors, he explained, with hens vulnerable to anxiety or aggression. Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said: 'While contingency plans are in place and the spread of bird flu is being effectively monitored, the combination of avian influenza, the coronavirus pandemic, and a tight, non-negotiable Brexit deadline, has proven yet again the vulnerability of Britain's food security.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "The combination of avian influenza, the coronavirus pandemic, and a tight, non-negotiable Brexit deadline, has proven yet again the vulnerability of Britain's food security."}]}

French producers of foie gras have called for a mass preventive cull of ducks to try to halt the spread of a severe strain of bird flu that is ripping through poultry farms in the south-west of the country. The highly pathogenic H5N8 virus was first detected in a bird in a pet shop on the Mediterranean island of Corsica in November before spreading to duck farms on the mainland in December. Several European countries have reported cases of infection, five years after a major outbreak prompted the slaughter of millions of ducks in France. \"The virus is stronger than us. New clusters are constantly emerging,\" the head of France's CIFOQ federation of foie gras producers, Marie-Pierre Pe, told Agence France-Presse. The number of outbreaks in France had now risen to 124, the ministry of agriculture said on Thursday, adding that about 350,000 ducks had been slaughtered since 24 December. Earlier this week the government's chief veterinary officer, Loic Evain, said more than 200,000 ducks had already been slaughtered and that a further 400,000 birds were set to be culled, out of about 35 million reared each year. He described the virus, which is not harmful to humans, as \"very, very contagious.\" Officials in Belgium said on Thursday they had culled three contaminated poultry flocks: one in Menin, in the west of the country, another in Dinant in the south and a third in Dixmude in western Flanders. Belgium's federal food safety agency AFSCA, which has ordered poultry owners to lock up their animals to avoid contamination, said that 20 cases of the virus had been found in wild birds. Herve Dupouy, a French producer who heads the local poultry section of the FNSEA farmers federation in the Landes department, a bastion of the foie gras industry, said \"The situation is out of control.\" He called on the state to cull all poultry flocks in the area and impose a two-month production freeze. \"There's no other solution,\" he said. So far the authorities have been culling all ducks and geese within a three-kilometre radius of an infected flock. Free-range chickens and turkeys within that range have also been slaughtered. CIFOQ said on Thursday that government officials had shared plans to expand the culls over a wider area. The bird flu clusters have been detected on poultry farms and in pet shops in the Landes department and the neighbouring Gers and Pyrenees-Atlantique departments. The head of France's chamber of agriculture, Sebastien Windsor, called on Wednesday for \"radical measures\" to try to restore confidence in export markets such as China which announced this week it was suspending French poultry imports over the virus. Producers of foie gras, a pate made from the livers of force-fed ducks or geese, fear a repeat of the devastation wrought by two previous waves of bird flu in the winters of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. More than 25m ducks were culled in the first outbreak, followed by 4.5m the following year, causing a steep decline in foie gras production. Besides France and Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain and Ireland have also reported bird flu outbreaks since the winter began. Dutch authorities culled 190,000 chickens in November after the discovery of the virus at two farms. Outbreaks have also been reported in India and South Korea. In India, tens of thousands of poultry will be slaughtered after an outbreak of deadly avian influenza was found to have killed scores of birds across the country. At least six Indian states have stepped up efforts this week to contain two strains of bird flu H5N1 and H5N8 after the deaths of thousands of migratory birds, ducks, crows and chickens. South Korea's agriculture ministry said on Thursday that it had so far culled 14.9m poultry since identifying its first farm-linked, highly pathogenic bird flu case in late November.

{"id": "39", "fulltext": "UK Health Security Agency says there is no evidence of spread of the infection to anyone else A rare case of bird flu has been detected in a person living in south-west England, health officials have confirmed. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the unnamed person acquired the infection from close and regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time. Bird-to-human transmission of avian flu is very rare and has occurred only a small number of times in the UK previously. The UKHSA said only a small number of contacts were involved, all of whom were professionals working as part of the incident management team. All contacts of the person, including those who visited the premises, had been traced and there was no evidence of onward spread of the infection to anyone else, it said. The infected person is well and self-isolating, and the risk to the wider public from avian flu remains very low. Prof Isabel Oliver, the chief scientific officer at UKHSA, said: \"Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we continue to monitor the situation closely. We have followed up all of this individual's contacts and have not identified any onward spread. It remains critical that people do not touch sick or dead birds, and that they follow the Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] advice about reporting.\" There have been a large number of outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of avian flu in birds across the UK, and alerts have been issued to bird owners. The UK's chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: \"We are seeing a growing number of cases in birds on both commercial farms and in back yard flocks across the country. Implementing scrupulous biosecurity measures will help keep your birds safe.\" Prof Mike Tildesley, a professor in infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, said: \"This is clearly going to be big news but the key thing is that human infections with H5N1 are really rare and they almost always occur as a result of direct, long-term contact with poultry. There has never been any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1, so at present I wouldn't consider this to be a significant public health risk.\"", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "deny_statement_1", "statement": "The risk to the wider public from avian flu remains very low."}, {"key": "deny_statement_3", "statement": "Human infections with H5N1 are really rare and they almost always occur as a result of direct, long-term contact with poultry."}]}
{"id": "85", "fulltext": "Highly virulent variants of avian flu now appear endemic in wild birds, making farms prone to outbreaks all year, experts warn. Free-range chickens and eggs may no longer be feasible to produce in the UK and elsewhere in Europe in future due to a dramatic escalation in avian flu outbreaks, say leading disease experts. The UK and continental Europe have been hit by the largest outbreak of avian flu on record this winter, with millions of birds culled on farms across the continent. Experts say highly pathogenic variants of avian flu now appear to be endemic in wild birds, creating a risk of infection all year. In the UK, farmers have been ordered to keep their birds indoors since last November and as of this week have been prevented from selling their eggs as free range. The latest reported outbreak, at a farm in Suffolk last weekend, led to more than 80,000 ducks being culled after confirmation of a highly pathogenic variant of avian flu. 'There is a serious problem for free-range and outdoor farms,' said Dr Guillaume Fournié, a veterinarian and epidemiologist at the Royal Veterinary College. 'We are seeing outbreaks on large [indoor] poultry farms that would have had high biosecurity. This suggests that with high environmental exposure to the virus, now it's hard to ensure a farm is 100% biosecure.' Marion Koopmans, a virologist and adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO), said the situation was 'horrible' for the free-range poultry industry. 'The ecology [of avian flu] has changed drastically in just a few years. We now have local circulation all year round in Europe, it's not just a seasonal threat. It has a permanent presence in the wild bird population.' Highly pathogenic avian flu is already endemic in a number of countries in Asia, with infection of poultry reported all-year round. 'The question [in the UK/Europe] is whether sedentary (non-migratory) wild birds will maintain the virus circulation over the summer. This would mean a constant pressure of infection on poultry farms, which would then increase seasonally with migratory birds,' said Fournié. Koopmans, who took part in the WHO's Covid mission to China in 2021, said higher levels of biosecurity, vaccination of chickens and reductions in intensive poultry farms in parts of Europe may all be needed to prevent outbreaks. Measures to ensure biosecurity and prevent infection reaching hens include cleaning and disinfecting, safe storage of feed and water and quarantining new stock. France, which has experienced close to 1,000 avian flu outbreaks this winter, has been trialling avian influenza vaccines, but the solution has been complicated by the numerous variants of avian flu. The market for free-range eggs has grown rapidly in the UK over the past decade. Last year, almost two-thirds of 11 billion eggs produced in the UK last year were free-range, up from 27% in 2004. The Co-op, Sainsbury's, M&S, Morrisons and Waitrose no longer stock eggs that are not free-range. Some have suggested introducing covered outdoor areas or changing the rules for free-range egg producers to allow for longer periods spent indoors. However, it is unclear how consumers would react to this shift. 'The whole point of free-range is they have the opportunity to roam outside,' said Andrew Knight, a veterinary professor at the University of Winchester. Radically changing the rules for free-range eggs would be wrong, said Dan Crossley, from the Food Ethics Council. 'I think most people have a reasonable understanding of what free-range is, so what we want to avoid is muddying the water and any confusion around what different terms mean.' UK government officials have said there are no plans to review the existing legislation, which provided producers with a 16-week 'derogation' during which the free-range description can be kept on eggs even though the hens have been confined. Mark Williams, chief executive of the British Egg Industry Council, said he was confident that hens would be allowed outside again soon. 'The greatest risk comes when the migratory birds are carrying it around, which is why we have these outbreaks at the same time every year between Autumn and Spring,' he said. The UK Health Security Agency said there was year-round avian flu surveillance of dead wild birds. 'Despite recording a record number of outbreaks this season, the risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low,' said a spokesperson. Transmission from an infected bird to a human is very rare, according to health officials, with fewer than five cases recorded in the UK, most recently in January, when a man caught it from ducks he kept inside his home.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "deny_statement_1", "statement": "Despite recording a record number of outbreaks this season, the risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low."}]}
{"id": "88", "fulltext": "Ready for more bad infectious diseases news? There's an outbreak of bird flu making its way into U.S. poultry flocks. If the virus continues to spread, it could affect poultry prices—already higher amid widespread inflation. The price of chicken breasts this week averaged $3.63 per pound at U.S. supermarkets—up from $3.01 a week earlier and $2.42 at this time last year, the Agriculture Department says. This week an outbreak was confirmed at a commercial flock in Nebraska, causing 570,000 broiler chickens to be destroyed. In Delaware and Maryland, more than two million birds at commercial poultry flocks have been affected. In South Dakota, an outbreak last week led to the killing of 85,000 birds. An outbreak confirmed March 14 at a commercial operation in Wisconsin meant more than 2.7 million egg-laying chickens were killed. The latest data from the USDA show 59 confirmed sites of avian flu across commercial and backyard flocks in 17 states since the start of the year. That figure includes chickens, turkey and other poultry. The USDA identified a case of avian flu in a wild bird in mid-January, the first detection of the virus in wild birds in the U.S. since 2016. Wild birds can spread the virus to commercial and backyard flocks. By Feb. 9, the virus had been identified in a commercial flock in Indiana. There have since been hundreds of confirmed cases of wild birds infected with avian flu. The last major avian flu outbreak in the U.S. was from December 2014 to June 2015, when more than 50 million chickens and turkeys either died from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or were destroyed to stop its spread. During that outbreak, chicken breast prices increased 17%, according to agriculture data company Gro Intelligence. But at the same time, prices for cuts of chicken geared toward the export market actually dropped due to bans on importing U.S. poultry in countries including China, South Korea, Cuba and Mexico. So the cost of leg quarters, for instance, dropped 18%, according to the data. Poultry prices—especially for eggs and turkey—were affected for years, the company reports. The impact on prices this time depends on how widespread the flu becomes. Whether the 2022 avian flu will affect the price of eggs and poultry depends on how widespread it becomes, says Ron Kean, a poultry science expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences. \"In 2015, we did see quite an increase in egg prices,\" Kean told Wisconsin Public Radio. \"The chicken meat wasn't severely affected at that time. We did see quite a loss in turkeys, so turkey prices went up. So, we'll see. If a lot of farms contract this, then we could see some real increases in price.\" What's the risk to humans from this bird flu? Not much so far, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the CDC's most recent update on March 7, the H5N1 bird flu poses a low risk to the public, and is currently \"primarily an animal health issue.\" The CDC notes that some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection. You can't get avian flu from eating poultry or eating eggs that are properly prepared and cooked, the USDA explains. The chance of infected poultry entering the food chain is extremely low, the agency says, because of its food inspection program and avian flu response plan. \"All poultry products for public consumption are inspected for signs of disease both before and after slaughter,\" the USDA notes, and avian flu causes a rapid onset of symptoms in poultry. For producers who suspect their flock may be affected by avian flu, the USDA has a guide to the warning signs, including a sudden increase in bird deaths, lack of energy and appetite, and a decrease in egg production. If a flock is found to be infected by bird flu, the USDA moves quickly—within 24 hours—to assist producers to destroy the flock and prevent the virus from spreading.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "deny_statement_1", "statement": "What's the risk to humans from this bird flu?

{"id": "111", "fulltext": "A deadly and highly infectious avian flu is forcing US farmers to kill millions of egg-laying hens, reducing the country's egg supply and driving up prices. On Thursday, retailers paid between $2.80 and $2.89 for a dozen large grade A white eggs in the Midwest, according to the USDA's daily Midwest regional egg report. That's more than double the roughly $1.25 they cost in March, according to data compiled by Brian Earnest, lead protein industry analyst at Cobank, which provides financial services to agribusiness. Typically, large white eggs in that region cost somewhere between $0.70 and $1.10 per dozen, said Earnest, who noted that the Midwest prices serve as a national benchmark. Around Easter, when demand is high, those prices can reach about $2, he said—far lower than they were on Thursday. Higher feed costs and supply chain difficulties have made many food items more expensive this year, and eggs are no exception. But this particular spike is being driven by the highly pathogenic avian influenza that has been detected in flocks across the country, Earnest noted. It's the worst US outbreak of the bird flu since 2015. Though the flu is deadly for poultry, it is \"primarily an animal health issue,\" according to the Centers for Disease Control, which added that it believes \"the risk to the general public's health from current H5N1 bird flu viruses is low.\" Because the flu is so contagious and deadly to birds, the USDA protocol is to kill infected flocks to curb the spread of the disease. In Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer, \"we currently have more than a dozen sites impacted by the disease,\" including three facilities where hens lay eggs, said Chloe Carson, communications director of the Iowa Department of Agriculture. As a result \"we have had to depopulate 11.2 million laying hens,\" out of about 56 million laying hens in Iowa overall, she said. This particular strain of the flu is being spread by wild migratory birds, Carson explained. The migration season typically lasts from March to May, she noted. \"As long as the migration patterns continue, there is a risk for disease to continue to be introduced to our domestic populations,\" Carson said. Pricier eggs this summer Although wholesale egg prices are spiking, that doesn't mean supermarkets are passing those costs onto consumers, explained Earnest. Retailers will often \"take a loss on eggs to draw in store traffic,\" he said. Generally, around Easter or Christmas, when people are more likely to bake, \"we'll see a reduced price on-shelf for eggs.\" So rather than raising prices, some stores appear to be dealing with the higher costs by eliminating their egg promotions. \"Retail promotional activity was very limited and offered little incentive for shoppers to buy beyond immediate needs,\" according to the USDA's weekly egg markets overview, published last Friday. Eventually, however, prices are likely to go up. \"I would expect we're going to see at least a 30 or 40 percent premium on top of [typical prices] through the summer months this year as a result of the tighter supply,\" Earnest said. He also noted that even before the flu was detected in the US earlier this year, the number of egg-laying hens was relatively low. And frozen or dry egg inventories are \"down significantly from what they typically are,\" he said. That could mean there will be some egg shortages later this year.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "deny_statement_1", "statement": "Though the flu is deadly for poultry, it is 'primarily an animal health issue,' according to the Centers for Disease Control, which added that it believes 'the risk to the general public's health from current H5N1 bird flu viruses is low.'"}]}
{"id": "144", "fulltext": "A case of influenza A(H5), also known as H5 bird flu, has been confirmed in a man in Colorado who had direct exposure to poultry and the culling of birds with presumptive H5N1 bird flu, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Thursday. \"This is the second human case associated with this specific group of H5 viruses that are currently predominant, and the first case in the United States,\" the CDC said. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) said the man is a state inmate younger than 40 who was working at a commercial farm in Montrose County. The man has recovered after experiencing fatigue, CDPHE said. He is currently isolated and is being treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir. \"Repeat testing on the person was negative for influenza,\" Colorado officials said in the statement. \"Because the person was in close contact with infected poultry, the virus may have been in the person's nose without causing infection.\" The CDC also said it's possible that the detection was a result of surface contamination. \"This one H5-positive human case does not change the human health risk assessment,\" the CDC said. \"CDC is taking routine preparedness and prevention measures, which includes an existing candidate vaccine virus that could be used to make vaccine for people if one were needed.\" People who are at higher risk of infection because of regular contact with infected birds should take precautions outlined on the CDC's website. Preventative measures include avoiding contact with poultry that appear ill or are dead and staying away from surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from wild or domestic birds. If handling wild birds or poultry, wear gloves and wash your hands when done. People may also wear a face mask and goggles if possible. In February, the avian flu was first detected in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, according to the US Department of Agriculture. This was the first case of infection in the US since 2020. The disease caused by the flu has been confirmed in commercial and backyard flocks across at least two dozen states and in wild birds across more than 30 states, according to the department.

{"id": "151", "fulltext": "Authorities in Colorado are monitoring the health of about 10 people who were in contact with a man who tested positive for H5 bird flu when he was involved in culling poultry infected with the virus. The man, who is incarcerated at a state correctional facility and was taking part in a pre-release work program, is being considered the country's first case of H5 bird flu. The people being monitored worked with him and shared transportation to the poultry operation. State Epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy said Friday that all the individuals have tested twice for the virus and all tests have been negative so far. They were all offered the flu antiviral Tamiflu, which can be used both to treat and prevent flu infections, though Herlihy wasn’t certain all had agreed to take it. They will be monitored for 10 days after their last exposure to the unidentified man, who she said had recovered from a very mild illness. “We’re being cautious,” Herlihy told STAT. “We’re using isolation, we’re using treatment, we’re monitoring contacts doing all of those things. But we continue to believe that the risk overall is low.” Related: CDC reports first human H5 bird flu infection in U.S. In reality, it’s not clear the man was infected. Workers who were culling the birds underwent daily symptom checks; on April 20, they were tested using nose swabs. On April 26, the state’s public health laboratory concluded the man had been infected with an influenza A virus, but it was unable to subtype the virus. The sample was then sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which confirmed on April 27 that the swab contained H5 virus. The subtyping of the neuraminidase the N in the virus’ name is still underway, but the presumption is that the birds and the man were infected with H5N1 viruses. The man was placed in isolation on April 26, after the state laboratory could not subtype the virus, Lisa Wiley, a public affairs officer for the Colorado Department of Corrections, said in an email. The move was taken out of an abundance of caution, she said. In interviews with public health officials after the fact, the man acknowledged feeling fatigued for a few days around the time the test was taken. But he reported none of the respiratory symptoms normally associated with flu. In a statement issued by the CDC on Thursday evening, the agency raised the possibility that the man may not have been infected the swab may have just picked up the virus in his nostrils. But the positive test means he meets the definition of a case, the CDC said. “There’s some additional work that CDC can do, but we might not ever know if this was truly an infection or not,” said Herlihy. For years countries have been on high alert for H5N1 infections in people. In the mid-aughts, these viruses labeled as highly pathogenic, because of their lethality to poultry spread from Southeast Asia to South Asia and North Africa, leaving devastation in their wake. Millions of birds died from the virus or from the culling needed to stop the virus’ spread. Related: Bird flu. SARS. China coronavirus. Is history repeating itself? And occasionally the virus jumped from poultry to people. In the past 20 years or so, roughly 880 people in 19 countries have been infected with H5N1. Just over half of them died. Fortunately, though, the virus to date has not acquired the capacity to spread easily from person to person and the fears that an H5N1 pandemic might be looming have faded. This case is unlikely to reignite them. The virus has changed over time, Todd Davis, who leads the CDC influenza division’s zoonotic virus team, said in an interview. The H5N1 viruses from 15 years ago or so had some different genes that appeared to allow them to trigger more severe illness when they infected people, he said. Those changes, particularly in the polymerase gene, are not present in most current day H5N1 viruses. And while the virus is still called H5N1, at a point a few years back it swapped genes with another flu virus, picking up a different neuraminidase. The new N1 is highly adapted to infect wild birds speeding its recent spread through Europe, Africa and North America but it seems less able now to infect people, Davis said. Since that reassortment event, the newly configured H5N1 has only been seen to have infected two people a man in the United Kingdom last December and the man in Colorado. The U.K. man kept poultry and the virus found its way into his flock. Though he tested positive, he experienced no symptoms. “There have only been two detected human cases since the virus was first detected in 2018,” Davis said. “That’s also pretty good evidence that this virus is just not as capable of infecting or causing disease in humans.” Still, flu viruses change constantly, and public health officials do not take lightly human infections with non-human flu viruses. “Our challenge at the moment is trying to keep up with those hundreds of people who are involved in culling operations or disinfection of infected farms, and making sure that we don’t see any changes in the virus that might increase the propensity for severe illness or transmissibility,” Davis said. “We’re still very much on high alert.”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_5", "statement": "Our challenge at the moment is trying to keep up with those hundreds of people who are involved in culling operations or disinfection of infected farms, and making sure that we don’t see any changes in the virus that might increase the propensity for severe illness or transmissibility."}]}

It is believed that the cub, which was located in Bartlett Cove in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve west of Juneau, is the second bear diagnosed with the highly pathogenic bird flu, the Juneau Empire reported. Bird flu passes really easily to poultry, but mammals aren’t really susceptible to it,” said Dr. Kimberlee Beckmen, a wildlife veterinarian for the department. “It’s difficult to get, but we suspect the cub probably ate a bird that died from avian influenza.” The bear likely became ill because it was a small, young animal with a weak immune system, she said. Since the virus was first detected in an adult female black bear in Canada in June, Alaska state officials have tested scavenging animals for it. So far, it’s only been found in two other animals, both red foxes in Dutch Harbor and the western Alaska community of Unalakleet. Finding bird flu in the bear and foxes is not an indication it’s likely to spread to other animals or to people, Beckmen said. “This particular strain, people are pretty much immune to it,” she said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this strain of bird flu poses a “very low” risk to humans, and only one person in the U.S. has been diagnosed in this outbreak. However, the flu has hammered the state’s wild bird population. People in Glacier Bay last month noticed that the cub, one of three accompanying a sow, had difficulty walking, according to state wildlife officials. The sow abandoned the cub and a biologist picked it up. However, it began suffering seizures, as did the Canadian bear previously diagnosed with the illness. The Alaska bear was euthanized by a state biologist. Later testing confirmed the presence of the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza.

{"id": "253", "fulltext": "One of the world's largest outbreaks of bird flu, which led to the slaughter of millions of chickens to limit its spread, appears to be spilling over into mammals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the avian influenza A virus has been detected in mammals such as skunks, bears, a raccoon and a red fox. Though most cases were detected in Oregon, positive tests in mammals were confirmed in the following states, according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services: * Alaska * Colorado * Idaho * Illinois * Montana * Nebraska * New York * Washington Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, the Animal and Plant Health Agency found positive cases in otters and foxes. The agency also said a cat tested positive in France, and the highly contagious pathogen caused a large outbreak in a Spanish mink farm. AVIAN FLU: Here's why egg prices are soaring across the US How is the bird flu being transmitted? Most of these infections are probably independent cases in which a mammal eats an infected bird, said Jürgen Richt, professor and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at Kansas State University. It may be happening more often during this outbreak as viral transmission increases among wild birds, such as ducks, geese and swans. The outbreak at the Spanish mink farm could be a special case in which the virus transmitted from mammal to mammal, Richt said. What does this mean for humans? Though more research is needed, it doesn't bode well for humans. \"If this virus has mammalian adaption and can transmit between mammals, humans are immunologically naive and humans are mammals,\" Richt said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the bird flu situation remains primarily an animal health issue. Only four human infections have ever been reported in the U.S., the CDC said. Bird flu is not a foodborne illness, so poultry and eggs found in grocery stores are safe to eat, Gregory Martin, a poultry educator at Penn State Extension, told USA TODAY last month.

{"id": "258", "fulltext": "Veteran influenza epidemiologist Keiji Fukuda remembers vividly when he first became fearful that a virulent bird flu virus, H5N1, might be on the verge of triggering a devastating pandemic. The virus, seemingly out of nowhere, did something bird flu viruses were thought not to be able to do. It infected 18 people, killing six of them. That happened in 1997, in Hong Kong. A quarter century later, H5N1 has returned to the headlines, with an outbreak at a Spanish mink farm reported in mid-January triggering the latest round of fears that the virus might be inching closer to acquiring the ability to easily transmit among humans. The mink outbreak is concerning, there is no doubt about that. Minks are closely related to ferrets, the animals most often used as a proxy for people when scientists study the characteristics of flu viruses. But it's important to remember that we've been somewhere like this before with this virus. Not precisely this spot H5N1 has a much larger geographic footprint now and it's been found to infect many more species of mammals. But there have been periods, some spanning years, when H5N1 was wreaking havoc, doing things that until that point had been thought to be out of reach for bird flu viruses, raising global concerns a pandemic might be right around the corner. And then, unexpectedly, it quieted down for a while. So while scientists who have been studying it for a couple of decades have a very healthy respect for H5N1, a number with whom STAT spoke are hedging their bets about the path H5 may be on. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine. Enter your email Privacy Policy \"I still think that this thing is as unpredictable as it has ever been,\" said Ron Fouchier, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam who moved into the field of influenza research, at Erasmus, because of the 1997 H5N1 outbreak. Scientists there, along with a colleague from Hong Kong, were the first to report that the virus was a bird flu virus. \"Trying to predict what H5N1 will do in the human population absolutely requires a great deal of scientific humility,\" cautioned Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. \"I will never, ever, take H5N1 for granted,\" he said. \"I just don't know what it's going to do.\" Fukuda, who in 1997 was an influenza scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was sent to Hong Kong by the agency to help in the investigation of that first outbreak. \"Everything was really new and the sense of things back then was that we were deeply, deeply afraid that this was the beginning of the next pandemic, of a really severe pandemic,\" said Fukuda, who later went to the World Health Organization, where he served for a time as an assistant director-general. He retired from Hong Kong University at the end of 2021. How does he feel about the latest act in the multi-act play that is H5N1's evolution, the spread into wild birds and poultry flocks throughout the Americas, and the lengthening list of mammalian species seen to have been infected with the virus? What does he think it portends? Fukuda gives the auditory equivalent of a shrug. \"Anyone who tries to predict anything about influenza is a bit foolish and hasn't been in the field very long,\" he said. \"I definitely have no idea what H5 is going to do, in 20 years whether we would have a similar discussion 'Oh is it ever going to do anything?' or if we'd be having a discussion saying 'Oh, my God, couldn't imagine that it was going to do that! That was really horrible,'\" Fukuda said. \"I think both of those discussions are plausible.\" STAT asked a number of experts, all of whom have been studying or following H5N1 for years, how they assess the current situation and how they'd describe their individual level of concern. None of them ever stopped worrying about H5N1. None of them like what they're seeing now. But most of them struggled to answer when asked if they are more worried now than earlier. Like in 2004, when a cluster of cases in a Vietnamese family raised the specter of limited person-to-person spread. Or 2005, when what was by then a poultry virus moved back into wild birds, which spread it to North Africa, Turkey and Europe. Or in the mid-to-late teens, when Egypt recorded more than 250 human cases in unsettling succession, 93 of them fatal. Since the 1997 outbreak, about 870 confirmed human cases have been detected. Just over half of those people died from the infection. UPCOMING EVENT STAT in DC: The Politics of Health Care On March 7, join STAT for a deep dive into the biggest discussions and decisions taking place in Washington. Privacy Policy \"I grapple with this a little bit myself,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children's Hospital in Memphis. \"The way I look at the current situation, I don't think the virus itself is necessarily any more worrying than what we've been seeing for the past 20-plus years. But what worries me right now is that this is a change in the epidemiology and the ecology of the disease. So we're absolutely seeing more chances of people coming in contact with this virus.\" Fouchier agreed. \"For me, that risk hasn't changed. In '97 there was a pandemic threat. And that pandemic threat has continued to exist, and we cannot really quantify the threat because we still don't really understand what it takes,\" said Fouchier, who in 2011 showed that with some mutations, H5N1 viruses could gain the capacity to transmit easily among ferrets. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, did similar work and got the same result. Both scientists had to fight to publish their studies, because of concerns the so-called gain of function work could provide a dangerous how-to guide for bad actors. (The debate this work sparked continues to this day, and it constrains with good reason, critics say the research that can be done to delve into what is keeping H5 from becoming a human flu virus.) Related: The future of pandemic preparedness: agile coordination around clinical trials Malik Peiris, a professor of virology at Hong Kong University, does not view the mink farm outbreak in Spain as H5N1's third act. \"I mean to me it's just one big act,\" he said. The outbreak, which occurred in October, saw H5N1 viruses move about a large mink farm in Galicia, in the northwest of Spain, sickening and killing a number of the animals. Eventually all the remaining minks there were nearly 52,000 animals before the outbreak began were euthanized. It is not clear how the virus entered the farm. But it seems possible, perhaps even probable, that at some point H5N1 spread from mink to mink. \"Our findings also indicate that an onward transmission of the virus to other minks may have taken place in the affected farm,\" the scientists who reported the event wrote in the journal Eurosurveillance. \"This is suggested by the increasing number of infected animals identified after the confirmation of the disease and the progression of the infection from the initially affected area to the entire holding.\" The mere idea of mink-to-mink transmission gives flu researchers pause. If a virus can transmit from one mammal to another, what's to stop it from transmitting between other mammalian species like ours? The U.S. Department of Agriculture alone reports 110 reports of mammalian infections with H5N1 in 2022-2023 multiple types of bears, foxes, skunks, possums, raccoons, even seals. It's hard, though, to assess the significance of these infections in mammals. For starters, the virus has long had the capacity to infect mammals. Tigers and snow leopards in a zoo in Thailand died in late 2003 after being fed poultry infected with H5. Over the years infections in domestic cats and dogs, stone martens, and civet cats have been detected. \"We have been there. But we also shouldn't be lulled into complacency when there are new facts,\" said Kanta Subbarao, director of the WHO's Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne, Australia. Subbarao, who in 1997 was at the CDC, was the lead author on the first scientific publication characterizing the H5N1 virus. Related: Experimental flu vaccine, developed using mRNA, seen as potential game changer She said it's not clear if the virus is entrenched in some animal populations which she said would \"escalate our problems quite significantly\" or if there is just so much virus in wild bird populations at this point that carnivores are becoming infected because they happen upon and eat infected birds. Even with the mink farm, one cannot say with certainty whether there was ongoing transmission or if the infected animals all had a common exposure, such as contaminated food they were fed poultry byproducts or contact with wild birds that could have moved about the netted cages the animals were housed in. Dead and sick birds infected with H5N1 were reported in the region in the weeks leading up to the outbreak. Webby doesn't like the sheer geographic spread of the virus and the increasing reports of spillover events instances when the bird virus infects mammals though he noted the viruses don't appear to have changed in significant ways. \"If we look at the virus and the sequence of it, there's nothing that suggests to us that it's become more infectious. But of course we don't know everything about that,\" he said. \"The virus may be the same, but there's just a whole lot more of it out there.\" \"So absolutely worried from this new development in the ecology, epidemiology,\" Webby said. \"But luckily nothing that's associated with that from the virologic side that has me running for the hills yet.\" One thing that does mitigate some of the concern is the fact that in recent years, there have been few human infections with H5N1. Whereas at points in the first two decades of this century it wasn't uncommon to have 20 or 30 cases a year, reports of human cases are rare these days, and often involve such mild disease it is not clear if the person who tested positive was infected or simply had viruses in their nostrils. A man in Colorado who was culling infected poultry last spring. Two poultry workers in Spain in November. A British man who had infected ducks in 2021. A recent H5 infection in a young girl reported from Ecuador is a rare severe case. One school of thought is that the decline in human cases is due to genetic changes in the virus that took place a while back. Related: The scientist behind Pfizer's Covid vaccine says a flu pandemic is only a matter of time For years, the internal genes of H5N1 were unchanging. Their origin was another bird flu virus, H9N2. Many, even most, of the human infections with bird flu viruses were caused by viruses that had that combination of internal genes from H9N2, Fouchier said. The current version of H5N1, known by the unwieldy name 2.3.4.4b, acquired other internal genes through reassortment, a gene-swapping process that can occur when multiple viruses infect a single host. \"If you like, the engine under the bonnet is different,\" Peiris said. Fouchier worries primarily at the moment about the virus' impact on biodiversity. Some species of wild birds are being decimated by the virus. But he also believes countries should be dusting off their pandemic influenza plans. \"There will be a new pandemic for sure. Whether it is this one, I don't know. But I think that the current situation is enough that countries actually [should] review their pandemic preparedness plans again,\" Fouchier said. None of the scientists quoted here would disagree. But Fukuda, and one of his former colleagues from the CDC, Tim Uyeki, think at this point the world would be better off focusing on spillover threats plural than one single type of bird flu. \"I think it's a major problem for the agricultural industry. And certainly there is a public health threat, but right now, it's probably low,\" said Uyeki, the chief medical officer of CDC's flu division. Uyeki joined the CDC the year after the 1997 outbreak, but was involved in the investigations of many of the outbreaks that happened from 2003 onward. Related: Why doesn't the U.S. have at-home flu tests? \"This is not the only virus that we should be concerned about for pandemic preparedness,\" he stressed. \"There are many other avian influenza A viruses circulating in birds and poultry that have sporadically transmitted to people and have caused a wide range of illness, including severe lower respiratory tract infection and fatal outcomes. And for that matter, if we even step back further and take a really big picture perspective... wherever you go in the world if you sample pigs, you will find swine influenza viruses.\" Fukuda said it would be short-sighted to focus solely on H5 bird flu, suggesting the world needs to invest more in being ready to detect and mitigate outbreaks caused by the array of animal viruses that could jump from animals to people and start transmitting among us. He worries that the Covid-19 experience, rather than strengthening our response capacity, has eroded political support for this type of work. And Osterholm worries about what the Covid pandemic has done to public support for public health. \"If we did have another pandemic right now I think it would be very difficult to get the public to do anything to try to limit or control transmission. That is to me a big setback,\" he said. Fukuda concurred. \"What has become clear to me over time is that the big challenge is not the viruses. That's not what gives me a pit in my stomach,\" he said. \"The real challenge is whether people, whether governments, whether policymakers have the ability to actually address the challenge in the way that needs to be done. And I don't see so much which encourages me, to be blunt. That's what gives me a pit in my stomach.\"", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_10", "statement": "The scientist behind Pfizer's Covid vaccine says a flu pandemic is only a matter of time."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_5", "statement": "Everything was really new and the sense of things back then was that we were deeply, deeply afraid that this was the beginning of the next pandemic, of a really severe pandemic."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_7", "statement": "For me, that risk hasn't changed.

{"id": "260", "fulltext": "An outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain is decimating wild and farmed bird populations globally, fueling a debate about the most effective ways to end it and the potential risk to humans. Some experts are concerned about the possibility that the H5N1 virus could one day evolve to more easily spread from birds to mammals. Although the risk to humans remains low, speculation about the virus has caused worry that the bird flu outbreak could develop into a larger threat. The Washington Post spoke to a number of experts to answer common questions about bird flu, the risk to humans and pets, and how the outbreak is affecting food prices. Here's what they had to say. What is bird flu? Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in about 6,000 wild birds and affected more than 58 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since the start of 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"It's been the most serious outbreak for birds that we've had in the U.S. of these highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in recent memory,\" said Nicole Nemeth, an associate professor of pathology and head of the wildlife research and diagnostic service at the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm. How does bird flu affect humans? It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds—whether the birds are dead or alive—or with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces. Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks—probably from eating infected wild birds—experts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. In fact, since the start of the current outbreak, only one human case has been reported in the United States. People who work closely with infected poultry are at an increased risk of becoming infected. Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis—an eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes—to more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said. The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain. A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus—by sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example—to develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. \"In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia,\" he said, and then \"the fatality rate is very high.\" Human-to-human transmission of the virus is very rare, Schaffner said. \"If that happens, that human being is usually a very close caregiver of the sick person,\" he said. What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans? Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms—fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing. The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the last 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said. Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat. How is it treated? People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said. Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans? Yes. Federal authorities have vaccines against A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) bird flu viruses that could be used if these viruses were to start spreading among the human population, the CDC said. Can bird flu kill humans? Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare. According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and 2023, there were 868 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 globally. Of those who were infected, 53 percent—or 457—died. Between 2021 and 2022, six confirmed cases of human bird flu infections were reported to the WHO, and two of those infected died. While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Could bird flu become the next pandemic? Each time there is a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person. That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people—a statistical phenomenon,\" Schaffner said. Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchange of genetic material is a random event. \"If anything, the odds are against it,\" Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although this strain has infected some mammals—including mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm—that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans,\" he said. Can dogs and cats catch bird flu? Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said. Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons. \"If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection,\" Cardona said. Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs? No. Humans cannot become infected by eating eggs or fully cooked poultry. However, according to the CDC, \"uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia.\" The CDC advises that \"it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States.\" Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry—and other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry—are typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. \"That's why there's so much death associated, in many ways,\" to the current outbreak, she said. \"It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products. They don't even make it into your pet food.\" What about my backyard chickens? People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said. Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease. Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying. People who have backyard chickens should still take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said. Has bird flu affected food prices? The outbreak drove up the price of Thanksgiving turkeys in November, but its impact continues to affect egg prices, which is dealing with a number of supply chain issues as well. According to the Agriculture Department, the bird flu has wiped out more than 44 million egg-laying hens, or roughly 4 to 5 percent of production. Does risk vary by state or country? Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk-free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. \"The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable,\" Iqbal said. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world. Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu? China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have also focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality. But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks. The United Kingdom, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly. Amid the current H5N1 outbreak, some European countries, including France and the Netherlands, are testing the effectiveness of bird vaccination. In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds who may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_2", "statement": "Speculation about the virus has caused worry that the bird flu outbreak could develop into a larger threat."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_4", "statement": "That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza.

{"id": "262", "fulltext": "Avian flu has infected a record number of birds and some mammals across the United States, and scientists are keeping close watch. World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that the risk to humans remains low but added, \"we cannot assume that will remain the case.\" As with the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 that is believed to have started in animals before spreading to humans, some animal viruses can mutate, jump species to make humans sick and spread quickly around the world. But highly pathogenic avian influenza is no Covid-19. Scientists are reassuring the public that, with a few rare exceptions, the virus hasn't made the jump to humans at a large enough scale to trigger an outbreak. It has gone far beyond birds, though, and its recent spread among members of a separate species has some experts concerned about the way the virus is changing. What is bird flu? Avian flu is a type A influenza virus that originated in birds. The version that's predominantly causing problems in the Americas and Europe is called H5N1. There are several subtypes, and H5N1 bird flu viruses commonly in circulation now are genetically different from earlier versions of the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since late 2022, scientists have detected this virus in more than 100 species of wild birds like ducks, seagulls, geese, hawks and owls in the US. Globally, this strain of the virus has actually been around a lot longer, said Richard Webby, an infectious disease researcher at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and director of WHO's Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. \"We saw the sort of great-great-granddad of the virus in the late 1990s in Southeast Asia, and we've been following its evolution and change ever since,\" Webby said.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that the risk to humans remains low but added, 'we cannot assume that will remain the case.'"}]}
{"id": "265", "fulltext": "NEW YORK (AP) — A recent bird flu outbreak at a mink farm has reignited worries about the virus spreading more broadly to people. Scientists have been keeping tabs on this bird flu virus since the 1950s, though it wasn't deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong among visitors to live poultry markets. As bird flu hits more and varied animals, like at the mink farm, the fear is that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic. Scientists say another kind of bird flu was likely behind the devastating 1918-1919 flu pandemic, and avian viruses played roles in other flu pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009. Still, the risk to the general public now is low, says Dr. Tim Uyeki of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A look at the bird flu virus and why it is getting renewed attention: WHAT IS BIRD FLU? Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but some others chiefly occur in animals. For example, there are flus that occur in dogs, plus pig — or swine — flu viruses. And then there are avian viruses that spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry. The bird flu virus drawing attention today — type A H5N1 — was first identified in 1959, by investigators looking into a flu outbreak in chickens in Scotland. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself. By 2007, the virus was found in more than 60 countries. In the U.S., it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations or backyard flocks in 47 states. Since the beginning of last year, tens of millions of chickens have died of the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading, one of the reasons cited for soaring egg prices. HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE GET BIRD FLU? The Hong Kong outbreak in 1997 was the first time this bird flu was blamed for severe human illness. Out of 18 people infected, six died. To contain the outbreak, the Hong Kong government closed live poultry markets, killed all the birds in the markets, and stopped bringing in chickens from southern China. It worked, for a while. Symptoms are similar to that of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people don't have noticeable symptoms, but some develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia. Globally, nearly 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization in 20 countries. But the pace has slowed and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years. In the vast majority of cases, the infected people got it directly from infected birds. The first and only U.S. case occurred just last April. A prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado, in the western part of the state. His only symptom was fatigue and he recovered. CAN IT SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE? In some instances, investigators concluded that the bird flu virus apparently did spread from one person to another. That happened in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, China and Pakistan, most recently in 2007. In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home. Scientists do not believe it can spread easily through casual contact, as seasonal flu can. But viruses mutate and change. Scientists worry about the ever-increasing number of opportunities for bird flu to mix with other flu viruses in infected people or animals and mutate, making it easier to spread to people. It wouldn't take much for that to happen \"and then we would be in a really tough situation,\" said Dr. Luis Ostrosky, chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. The CDC's Uyeki said the most worried he's been about H5N1 was during the earlier clusters. That kind of human-to-human spread does not appear to be happening right now, he said. WHAT HAPPENED AT THE MINK FARM? Recent concern among public health experts has been fueled, in part, by detection of infections in a variety of mammals. The growing list includes foxes, raccoons, skunks, bears and even marine mammals like seals and porpoises. Officials in Peru said three sea lions found dead in November tested positive for, and the recent deaths of hundreds of others may be due to bird flu. Then last month, a European medical journal reported on a bird flu outbreak in October at a mink farm in Spain with nearly 52,000 animals, where the illness spread like wildfire. The mink were fed poultry, and wild birds in the region had been found to have bird flu. But researchers said that however it started, they believe the virus then spread from mink to mink — a worrisome scenario. No workers were infected, though they wore masks as part of COVID-19 precautions. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, said the outbreak virus is being watched for mutations that could make it more easily transmitted to people, and potentially between people. \"That's the real worry,\" said Nuzzo. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

{"id": "268", "fulltext": "A father and daughter were said to be infected with H5N1; the daughter died. Scientists are searching for evidence of transmission between humans. Here's what you need to know. Cambodia has reported two cases of bird flu infection in people, a father and daughter in a village in the country's Prey Veng province. The 11-year-old girl died earlier this week. The cases, the first reported in Cambodia since 2014, have raised fears that the virus has acquired the ability to spread among people and may trigger another pandemic. The Cambodian government is testing 11 other people, four of whom have flulike symptoms, for infection with the H5N1 flu virus. The 49-year-old father has tested positive but was not showing any symptoms, according to the health ministry. The World Health Organization is working closely with the Cambodian government to determine whether the father and daughter each acquired the virus by direct contact with infected birds -- the most likely possibility -- or whether they infected each other. Experts urged caution, noting that there have been hundreds of sporadic cases of H5N1 infection in people since the virus was first identified but no evidence that it has become particularly well adapted to humans. Transmission among people is 'very, very rare, versus a common source of infection,' said Richard Webby, a bird flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and an adviser to the W.H.O. But people should take care to avoid contact with wild birds that may be infected, Dr. Webby said. 'The risks from this virus to your average person on the street right now is very low, but it's not zero,' he said. 'And that's primarily because there's just so many more infected birds around right now.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_3", "statement": "The risks from this virus to your average person on the street right now is very low, but it's not zero."}]}
{"id": "269", "fulltext": "After a girl in Cambodia died from H5N1, the UK Health Security Agency is on alert but says human-to-human transmission is rare. British health officials are preparing plans to deploy lateral flow tests if signs emerge that avian flu has begun to spread from one person to another. The programme would provide rapid information about the dangers posed by the disease. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is also working on blood tests to detect antibodies against the virus and officials will analyse the disease's genetic mutations to reveal data about the increased risk to human health from avian flu. The moves follow last week's news that an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia has died from H5N1, the flu strain that is being spread around the globe by migrating birds and is infecting poultry farms. Investigators are now trying to establish if infected birds were the cause of the Cambodian case, rather than human-to-human transmission. At present, evidence suggests the H5N1 virus does not pass easily to people although scientists have urged care and caution. 'Viruses constantly evolve, and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population,' said Dr Meera Chand, incident director for avian influenza at the UKHSA. This point was backed by Professor Ian Brown of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). 'There have been over 850 cases in humans across the globe since 1996 with a high case-fatality rate. Almost all cases to date have not resulted in human-to-human transmission but vigilance is required.' Scientists also warned last week that although direct risks of infection were low, people should avoid contact with sick or dead wild birds in public areas such as parks or waterways and should wash their hands after feeding wild birds. Last week, the UKHSA confirmed it had found avian flu cases in poultry at 145 premises and in 656 wild birds in England, a rise of 15 new premises and 209 detections in wild birds since December 2022. In addition, 14 out of 134 wild mammals collected since October 2021 were found to have avian flu: four in foxes in England and one in Wales. In Scotland, there were four cases in otters, four in seals and one in a fox. 'This virus keeps cropping up in various mammals and this could increase the possibility of further human infections,' said Prof Jonathan Ball, of Nottingham University. 'The risk to humans is still very low, but it's important that we continue to monitor circulation of flu in both bird and mammal populations.' The human Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 50 million people, is believed to have been triggered by a successful transmission of an avian flu virus to humans. 'The initial strain then adapted and became endemic in the human population, giving rise to the seasonal flu viruses,' said Professor Massimo Palmarini, director of the Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow University. 'This is why it is important to detect human cases of avian influenza as quickly as possible and make sure that we give as little opportunity as possible to the virus to be transmitted further and mutate.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_2", "statement": "Officials will analyse the disease's genetic mutations to reveal data about the increased risk to human health from avian flu."}]}
{"id": "272", "fulltext": "Minks in Spain, seals in Scotland, sea lions and dolphins in South America: a number of mammal species have recently been found to be infected with H5N1, a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza. Avian flu is not new; epidemiologists have been studying it for decades. But the detection of the virus in mammals has many concerned about the potential that it could spill over to humans and cause a larger outbreak. As the world enters the fourth year of a global pandemic caused by a virus that likely came from an animal, concern over another virus potentially uprooting our lives is valid. H5N1 has infected humans before, although human-to-human transmission has rarely been observed. And while the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the mortality rate of avian flu in humans is around 56 percent, many experts believe it's likely to be much lower if the virus becomes more transmissible. One reason avian flu is so lethal is that it infects the lower respiratory tract, which can lead to respiratory failure. If it were to mutate to infect the upper respiratory tract and spread more easily, it would probably cause milder illness. Yet even a virus that causes mild or moderate illness in many people can have a serious toll, as we've seen with the COVID pandemic. So efforts are underway to develop vaccines to protect against such a form of bird flu. Bird flu has spilled over to humans before—in fact, just last week a girl in Cambodia died from H5N1 (although not the same strain as the one that is sickening birds worldwide). \"Each time we see this happen, we get these spurts of cases, [and] people say, 'Here it comes; it's going to happen,'\" says Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. But he stressed that H5N1 is likely not an imminent threat to humans. Others agree. \"I'm keeping a close eye on it as an expert, but as a member of the community, as a parent and someone who [has been] recently experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm not worried about this right now,\" says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"This is an animal health issue right now that has a theoretical risk to become a human health issue.\" Avian influenza viruses infect birds by attaching to a receptor in their respiratory tract. In order for the virus to become a human virus and start circulating from person to person in the population, it would have to be able to attach itself to the human version of this receptor—something it hasn't yet evolved to do. \"It's a really dangerous time to be a bird,\" Andrew Pavia, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah, adds. \"But as of today, the risk to humans remains very low. Our concern is what's going to happen as it circulates more and more.\" It's unfortunately nearly impossible to predict when this jump could happen. \"None of us know when the next influenza pandemic will emerge. It could be tomorrow [or] it could be years from now, and we don't know which of the viruses will become the next pandemic virus,\" Osterholm says. \"At the outset, you have to say there is uncertainty, with one exception: there will be a pandemic.\" The U.S. is somewhat equipped to handle avian flu: there is a stockpile of egg-based flu vaccines for the H5N1 strain. Eggs are one of the most common ways to make a flu vaccine. To create it, manufacturers inject an inactivated or weakened virus into a fertilized chicken egg, incubate the egg for a few days while the virus multiplies and then harvest the virus to use for the vaccine. The country has a secret chicken stockpile in undisclosed locations across the U.S. just in case we need to make egg-based vaccines quickly—such as during a flu pandemic. It may be concerning that this vaccine strategy depends on an animal that is highly susceptible to the flu in question. But several experts told Scientific American that there are high levels of biosecurity at the chicken facilities in order to avoid bird flu contamination. Alternatives to egg-based vaccines exist. Since the early 2010s, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been partnering with CSL Seqirus, one of the largest influenza vaccine manufacturers, to develop vaccines grown in cells in a laboratory. The pandemic preparedness vaccine AUDENZ, which targets the H5N1 subtype specifically, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And although it's impossible to determine which virus will cause the next pandemic, CSL Seqirus has a library of viruses that have the potential to infect humans. And the company is constantly looking for candidate vaccine viruses that it can tailor to a specific pathogen. \"We use data [for] one of the avian strains to create a mock-up file,\" says Marc Lacey, who runs CSL Seqirus' pandemic preparedness and response team. The team members basically identify certain viruses, use them to create vaccines and conduct some of the early safety studies so that if an avian flu strain evolves into a true pandemic strain transmitting between humans, they will be ready to go with an adequate vaccine. Lacey says that his company would be able to supply the U.S. government with 150 million doses within the first six months of a pandemic being declared, but he thinks the scale-up potential could be higher, especially if multiple manufacturers could help produce it. Because there are eight billion people in the world, scale-up and widespread collaboration across countries would be necessary to make enough vaccine. There are also efforts to apply messenger RNA (mRNA) technology—such as that used for some of the COVID vaccines—to flu vaccines. According to University of Washington microbiologist Deborah Fuller, these efforts range from developing a universal flu vaccine to creating a \"multivalent\" vaccine that targets only a few subtypes—or versions of the virus (like a typical seasonal flu vaccine does). One advantage of mRNA technology is its speed of production. And because of the COVID pandemic, there is now more infrastructure to mass-produce doses. \"RNA vaccines can be designed extremely quickly—you only need the genetic sequence of what the new variant is that's emerging, and within weeks, [you] can have a vaccine already tested in animal models,\" Fuller says. Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, is also investigating mRNA flu vaccines. He's part of a research team developing a 20-subtype mRNA flu vaccine that includes an H5N1 strain (although not the one currently circulating in birds). The team recently published its findings in Science. Hensley's lab is now developing a single-strain vaccine tailored to the current bird flu strain—and is already testing it in laboratory animals. He emphasizes that, as with the COVID vaccines, his vaccines are meant to prevent serious illness and death, not infection. But even the 20-subtype vaccine is expected to provide some protection against the new strain. \"When we developed [that] vaccine, the idea was to create one that could induce a certain level of immune memory against every subtype,\" Hensley says. \"Our goal wasn't to predict which influenza subtype would cause the next pandemic or which strain would cause it. Rather the vaccine [would induce] some level of immune memory against every subtype so that it would limit disease and death caused by new pandemic strains.\" A vaccine is only part of pandemic preparedness—you also need effective treatments. As Pavia says, researchers aren't working from scratch trying to create something like the COVID antiviral Paxlovid, which took nearly two years to get to market. FDA-approved antivirals for influenza, such as Tamiflu, already exist and will be important for reducing deaths during a flu pandemic. Pavia is also hopeful that the U.S. could quickly adapt diagnostic tests to match an outbreak strain of pandemic flu. \"We have better tools and better knowledge about influenza than we did about coronaviruses. In many ways, we would be a step ahead,\" Pavia says. \"But what I worry about is our political capacity to respond. We need to continue to [increase] awareness and continue preparation efforts. And if things start to accelerate, we need a concerted, nonpoliticized effort to move quickly and effectively.\"", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_7", "statement": "None of us know when the next influenza pandemic will emerge.

{"id": "291", "fulltext": "This exclusive article is adapted from former USA TODAY investigative reporter Alison Young� forthcoming book \"Pandora� Gamble: Lab Leaks, Pandemics, and a World at Risk,\" which will be released April 25. In this excerpt, Young reveals for the first time details of a December 2019 lab safety breach involving one of the world� most infamous lab-created �ain of function�iruses �nd the efforts that were made to downplay the event, avoid notifying health authorities and oversight bodies, and keep the public and policymakers in the dark. Inside the high-security Influenza Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, two experienced scientists were pulling ferrets out of their HEPA-filtered cages on a Monday in December 2019. Another researcher, still in training, was also in the room to watch and learn. One by one, the animals were put into a biosafety cabinet, where a solution was washed into their nostrils. It� a procedure used to collect evidence of infection, and this particular experiment involved exposing the animals to a highly controversial lab-engineered strain of H5N1 avian influenza virus. The virus they were working with that day was far from ordinary, and there should have been no room for the safety breach that was about to happen and the oversight failures that followed. The experiment underway involved one of two infamous lab-made bird flu viruses that had alarmed scientists around the world when their creation became widely known nearly a decade earlier. In each case, scientists had taken an avian influenza virus that was mostly dangerous to birds and manipulated it in ways that potentially increased its threat to humans. In nature, the H5N1 virus has rarely infected humans. But when people have been sickened, usually through close contact with infected birds, more than half died. So it is fortunate that the H5N1 virus isn� capable of spreading easily from person to person. If the virus were ever to evolve in ways that gave it that ability, it could cause a devastating pandemic. 'Gain of function' research created controversial flu viruses And yet in late 2011 the world learned that two scientific teams �ne in Wisconsin, led by virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka, and another in the Netherlands, led by virologist Ron Fouchier �ad potentially pushed the virus in that direction. Each of these labs had created H5N1 viruses that had gained the ability to spread through the air between ferrets, the animal model used to study how flu viruses might behave in humans. The ultimate goal of this work was to help protect the world from future pandemics, and the research was supported with words and funding by two of the most prominent scientists in the United States: Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH� National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Kawaoka contended it would be �rresponsible not to study�ow the virus might evolve in nature. �ome people have argued that the risks of such studies �isuse and accidental release, for example �utweigh the benefits. I counter that H5N1 viruses circulating in nature already pose a threat,�e said at the time. Yet these groundbreaking scientific feats set off a heated international debate over the ethics and safety of �ain of function�esearch. The controversy continues to this day. Concerns about the safety of biological research have taken on heightened urgency in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and growing acceptance of the possibility that it was caused by a lab accident in China. In February, it was revealed that analysts at the U.S. Department of Energy had joined the FBI in leaning toward a lab accident as the most likely source of the pandemic, though other U.S. intelligence agencies lean toward a natural origin or are undecided. Where's the apology?: COVID may have leaked out of a Chinese lab after all. So much for 'misinformation.' Former U.S. surgeon general: We'll never know the full truth about COVID-19 origins. Political infighting won't help. The story of how the H5N1 viruses came to be created �nd how the University of Wisconsin and the Kawaoka lab would later respond to the 2019 safety breach during the ferret experiment �aises uncomfortable questions about the tremendous trust the world places in these kinds of labs. We are trusting that every hour of every day their layers of laboratory containment equipment are working properly, that all of their employees are sufficiently trained, qualified and attentive, and that their written safety and incident response protocols are followed in real-life practice. When something goes wrong, we are trusting that the labs will immediately notify local public health officials who are responsible for preventing outbreaks and the federal authorities who oversee the safety of experiments with genetically engineered organisms. Given that so much about this work is shrouded in secrecy, what happened in Wisconsin raises the question: Should the public give this trust blindly? 'Miscommunication' over quarantine alarmed NIH a decade ago In 2013, six years before the 2019 safety incident with the ferret experiment at Kawaoka� lab in Wisconsin, another member of his research team accidentally pierced their finger with a needle that had an engineered H5N1 virus on it. It was a moment of poor judgment, human error around 6:30 p.m. Nov. 16, 2013, that set off a series of emergency calls that would eventually raise concerns in the nation� capital. An expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told officials at Wisconsin� state health department that while the likelihood the scientist would develop symptoms of H5N1 was �ow,�he needlestick �hould be considered a serious exposure�nd treated aggressively. The chief medical officer at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services told the university that the researcher would need to quarantine for seven days and take a treatment-level dose of Tamiflu twice a day for 10 days. Six months earlier, while seeking funding and approval for the controversial experiments, Kawaoka had assured officials at the National Institutes of Health that the university had a designated quarantine apartment. But it turned out that wasn� the case. So lab officials told the researcher� family to pack up their belongings and go to a hotel. And the injured researcher was sent to quarantine at home. Officials in the NIH office responsible for overseeing research with engineered organisms were alarmed to learn that the university didn� have a dedicated quarantine facility for such emergencies. �his policy is not what was communicated to us in Dr. Kawaoka� application to perform research with mammalian transmissible strains of H5N1,�rote Dr. Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, acting director of the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, in a letter to the university. A researcher� home, the NIH told the university, was not an appropriate quarantine site for Kawaoka� high-risk studies because influenza viruses can be transmissible through the air, and many residences are in high-occupancy buildings, like apartments, that share air exchange and other infrastructure. Trying to provide an explanation, university officials told NIH there had been a �iscommunication�etween Kawaoka and the university� administration. Wisconsin officials noted that the needlestick was not expected to put the researcher at high risk of infection, and that this engineered virus �as determined not to be a mammalian-transmissible strain.� The scientist with the needlestick completed quarantine without showing symptoms or becoming ill. But even if a high-risk incident occurred with a more dangerous strain, UW officials told the NIH, the lab worker would still be quarantined at home. Could an accident have caused COVID-19?: Why the Wuhan lab-leak theory shouldn't be dismissed 'I remember it very well': Dr. Fauci describes a secret 2020 meeting to talk about COVID origins It was a stunning change by the university to a critical safeguard that federal officials thought was in place for the Kawaoka lab� research. The NIH demanded the university find a dedicated quarantine facility outside of workers�esidences, such as a hospital isolation room, or face the suspension or termination of its grant funding, correspondence shows. The university didn� want to use the UW Hospital as a quarantine site. Their concerns included that researchers might be unwilling to come forward about potential exposures if they faced being confined in hospital isolation rooms. The university and its medical team also worried about the increased potential for the public to learn about its lab accidents, noting in correspondence that �t would be much harder to control the spread of information and as a result there would be a higher probability of incorrect information being told to (the) general public and potentially members of the media.� The university eventually agreed to NIH� demands. And on Dec. 24, 2013, the NIH gave its approval for Kawaoka� lab to resume its research manipulating H5N1 virus strains that were transmissible to mammals. Safety concerns led to US pause on 'gain of function' studies By 2014, there was a growing discomfort at the highest levels of the U.S. government about the risk of an accident with an engineered virus. Wisconsin� needlestick incident, which drew questions within NIH but wasn� publicly known, was soon followed by a series of high-profile accidents at federal labs in 2014 �rom safety breaches with anthrax and avian influenza at the CDC to the discovery of forgotten vials of smallpox that had been kept for decades in a storage room on the NIH Existing text... campus. In October 2014, citing these federal lab incidents, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced a moratorium on new federal funding for certain gain-of-function research while the risks and benefits of the controversial experiments were studied. The funding pause remained in place for three years until it was finally lifted in December 2017. But it was only in 2019 that some of the halted experiments were quietly allowed to begin again under a revised federal oversight process, which was criticized for keeping secret the details of the new experiments and the basis for the government approvals. The Kawaoka lab was one of the first to receive approval and NIH funding. Not long after the Kawaoka lab was greenlighted in 2019 to resume work with its infamous lab-created H5N1 influenza virus �he one that had helped spark the worldwide debate over gain-of-function research �here was an accident. And in the days and weeks that followed, efforts were made to downplay the significance of the event, avoid notifying public health officials and oversight bodies, and keep the public and policymakers in the dark. A lot was at stake. Not only would the incident draw attention to safety issues at the UW lab, but it also would raise larger questions about the rigor and effectiveness of how the U.S. government was overseeing the riskiest experiments in which scientists are creating enhanced pathogens with pandemic potential. Scientist's air hose detached in lab while working with engineered virus When the accident happened on Dec. 9, 2019, Kawaoka� three scientists were working in an enhanced biosafety level 3 agriculture lab suite at the University of Wisconsin� Influenza Research Institute. This facility had been built specifically for Kawaoka� research and featured labs with negative air pressure, watertight and airtight seals, double HEPA-filtered exhaust air and redundant air handling systems. The experiment they were performing involved a virus whose name describes the components of its engineering: VN1203HA(N158D/N224K/ Q226L/T318I)/CA04. It was the virus described in Kawaoka� controversial H5N1 gain-of-function experiments that had been published nearly eight years earlier, the NIH would later confirm in written responses to my questions. It was the virus that had gained the concerning ability to spread between ferrets and had raised fears it could do this among humans. On that December day, two experienced researchers from Kawaoka� team were helping train a colleague as they collected samples from ferrets. The animals were part of a transmission experiment and had been in contact with other ferrets infected with this engineered H5N1 virus or another wild-type flu strain. The three scientists wore several layers of personal protection equipment. One of their most important pieces of personal protective equipment was the air-purifying respirator that each wore to ensure they didn� breathe any air from inside the laboratory. Even though they were using a biosafety cabinet, there was always the potential for virus to be present in the room� air. These kinds of high-tech respirators encase workers�eads in a protective hood with a clear face-plate. A blower attached to a belt delivers purified air through what looks like a vacuum cleaner hose that runs up the scientist� back and attaches to the hood behind their head. Labs are responsible for training workers how to properly assemble and use this kind of equipment. As one of the senior researchers prepared to start collecting samples from the next round of ferrets, the trainee realized there was a problem with their respirator. The powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) hose had somehow disconnected from the unit that supplied safe, filtered air. Instead, the detached hose dangled loose in the lab� potentially contaminated air. The hose was �mmediately�econnected, Wisconsin officials later said, and one of the experienced researchers radioed out to the lab� operations manager as the trainee began the process of exiting the lab, incident records show. The trainee was initially told to follow the lab� quarantine procedure to keep them spreading the virus if they were infected. The university would later say this was done �ut of an abundance of caution.�ut at some point, a lab compliance official released the worker from quarantine. It is unclear whether this quarantine release happened within minutes, hours or days of the incident. Nor is it clear whether university officials first consulted with any public health and oversight agencies. Kawaoka and university officials wouldn� agree to be interviewed and provided little information in response to my questions. State and local health officials weren't notified about lab accident If there were ever a virus requiring that everyone follow safety and incident reporting rules, this was it. The system of oversight in place that day had been created in response to the international furor over this very virus. Yet, after the trainee� respirator hose disconnected in December 2019, the university didn� notify local or state public health officials about the incident or consult with them before discontinuing the trainee� quarantine, despite representations going back years indicating this would occur following �ny potential exposure.� The university says it didn� need to notify them. That� because UW officials, in consultation with the university� health experts, made their own determination that no potential exposure had occurred. Officials at Public Health Madison & Dane County, the local health department, told me they defer to the university� judgment and expertise when it comes to lab safety issues. The department said it �oes not need to be notified of something that was determined to not be a significant exposure. It is also not incumbent on us to further evaluate whether there was a significant exposure, if UW reports that there was not.� The university also didn� immediately alert other key oversight entities that the public relies upon to ensure the safety of this kind of particularly risky research. UW officials waited two months �ntil Feb. 10, 2020 �o file a report that should have been made immediately to the NIH Office of Science Policy, which oversees U.S. research with genetically manipulated organisms like the engineered H5N1 influenza virus involved in the experiment. Records show the university� internal biosafety committee, which had approved the Kawaoka lab� research, wasn� �pprised�f the Dec. 9, 2019, incident until Feb. 5, 2020. The university was less slow in reporting the incident to the federal funding officials at NIH� National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which provided the grant for the controversial experiments. But UW still waited 10 days �ntil Dec. 19, 2019 �o report the incident to NIAID program staff, according to information provided to me in writing by NIH officials. The grant� terms required immediate notification in the event of an �llness or exposure.�t was UW� contention, however, that �either of the two criteria were met�ecause there was �o reasonable risk of virus exposure,�IH officials told me. When the university eventually notified grant officials, it said it was doing so �n the spirit of transparency and responsible conduct of research,�he NIH said. UW officials, who for months wouldn� answer many of my questions about the incident, eventually said that Kawaoka �nformed his program officer at NIH in early December,�efore following up with an incident summary on Dec. 19.

NIH said that the first time UW contacted anyone at the agency was on Dec. 12, 2019 �hree days after the incident. That� when UW first requested a phone call from an NIAID program officer. A first discussion about the incident happened on Dec. 13, and on Dec. 16, during a follow-up discussion, NIAID staff asked UW to send in a written description of the incident. Both NIAID Director Anthony Fauci and NIAID Principal Deputy Director Hugh Auchincloss �ere briefed about the incident,�he NIH said in a written response to my questions. But NIH would not tell me when Fauci and Auchincloss were briefed or whether they provided guidance on how the UW incident should be handled. UW officials said Kawaoka� lab immediately reported the incident to the CDC� select agent lab regulators. But the university didn� answer my questions about why the incident was immediately reported to the CDC �nd not NIH �iven UW� stated position that there wasn� any potential exposure. It is unclear whether Kawaoka� team consulted the CDC in advance of the university� decision to release the researcher from quarantine. CDC officials �ncluding Dr. Samuel Edwin, who heads the select agent program �idn� answer my questions about this. University notified federal oversight team 2 months after lab accident When the university finally notified the NIH Office of Science Policy about the ferret incident �wo months after it happened �W officials unsuccessfully tried to justify their significant delay by saying the incident was �ot reportable �ecause even though the trainee� PAPR tube had detached, in their view there was �o potential exposure.� The university� justifications, records show, included that the ferrets had been handled inside a biosafety cabinet and that the contact ferrets had been exposed to infected ferrets for only about 24 hours �nd were not shedding virus yet.� The university also told NIH officials that �he air the observer would have breathed during the few seconds the hose was disconnected would have come from inside the PAPR hood, which would have been HEPA- filtered before the hose disconnected.� The lab� report to the NIH doesn� say how they determined this. The reason UW finally told the NIH oversight office about the incident was because lab regulators at the Federal Select Agent Program �s well as the NIH office that funded the research ��ecommended�t be reported. The report UW finally submitted to the NIH Office of Science Policy includes the following notation: �Confidential �o not release this information without written authorization of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.� What were the consequences of UW� delayed reporting of the incident? The NIH Office of Science Policy told me it �eminded the institution about its reporting responsibilities,�nd �oted that it should have been immediately reported to OSP.� If NIH delivered that message, UW officials say they never heard it. �his is certainly the kind of information we would have remembered or recorded in notes taken at the time,� UW spokesperson said by email. UW repeatedly pointed to a short email from an NIH analyst thanking the university for its Feb. 10, 2020, report and adding that �he actions taken in response to this incident appear appropriate.�IH says this email referred only to UW� �iosafety actions,�ot to the university� failure to file an immediate report. In the end, the trainee apparently didn� become infected. But how the university and the lab oversight system handled the incident should be cause for concern. �t is all too easy to sensationalize this research, to misconstrue events, and misrepresent the nature of incidents rightfully reported by institutions to regulatory agencies,�aid Kelly Tyrrell, UW� director of media relations, in a email that spoke in broad brushstrokes about the importance of research, the humanity of researchers, and how sometimes there can be differences in interpretations of incident reporting requirements and about regulations. Tyrrell said that UW takes safety seriously, and that the Kawaoka lab has never had an incident where public health or safety have been put at risk. �here are few people in the world trained to understand the nature of the pathogens involved, the biosafety and biosecurity measures in place and the protocols developed and followed,�yrrell continued. �ost people are also not equipped to appropriately evaluate the risk. It is unfortunate that some seek to capitalize on this knowledge gap.� Alison Young is an investigative reporter in Washington, D.C., and serves as the Curtis B.

{"id": "294", "fulltext": "NEW YORK (AP) � man in Chile is infected with a bird flu that has concerning mutations, but the threat to people from the virus remains low, U.S. health officials said Friday. Past animal studies suggest these mutations could cause the virus to be more harmful or spread more easily, health officials said. But they also said there is no evidence that the mutations would make it easier for it to take root in a person� upper lungs � development that would raise concerns about spread among people. The mutations do not change public health officials�ssessment of the overall risk to people from the H5N1 virus, which \"continues to be low,�aid Vivien Dugan of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The mutations, which have appeared only in the one hospitalized patient, may have occurred after the man got sick, CDC officials said. There� no evidence that the mutated virus spread to other people, mixed with other flu viruses, or developed the ability to fight off current medicines or evade vaccines, agency officials said. Such genetic changes have been seen in past bird flu infections. �evertheless, it� important to continue to look carefully at every instance of human infection,\" Dugan said. \"We need to remain vigilant for changes that would make these viruses more dangerous to people.� This type of flu, called Type A H5N1, was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, when visitors to live poultry markets caught it. Sporadic outbreaks have followed, and more than 450 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of infected people got it directly from birds. As bird flu hits other species, however, scientists fear the virus could evolve to spread more easily among people. And it has been spreading widely, to birds and animals in scores of countries. In the U.S., it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks across the country. Since the beginning of last year, tens of millions of chickens have died of the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading, one of the reasons cited for soaring U.S. egg prices. The new lab analysis looked at the virus found in the lungs of a 53-year-old man living in Chile� Antofagasta region. It may be that he became infected through contact with sick or dead birds or infected sea lions, according to a WHO summary of the case. The man was healthy and had not traveled recently. On March 13, he started getting a cough, sore throat and hoarseness, the WHO said. His symptoms worsened and he eventually was sent to an intensive care unit and treated with antiviral medicines and antibiotics. He is still hospitalized and being monitored, CDC officials said. Genetic sequencing this week revealed the two concerning mutations. Chilean and American health officials have been working together on the investigation. Andrew Pekosz, a flu researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said he hasn't seen the preliminary analysis of the Chilean patient's infection. �hen these viruses get into humans, there's a likelihood that they start to adapt to grow better in us,�nd this is a sign that is happening, he said. There are three or four kinds of mutations that would need to be seen in a H5N1 virus �efore that would really raise the alarm signal that something is happening of concern,�e added. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute� Science and Educational Media Group.

{"id": "295", "fulltext": "These changes were unlikely to be enough to allow the virus to spread easily among humans, and the health risk to the public remains low, experts said. A sample of avian influenza isolated from a Chilean man who fell ill last month contains two genetic mutations that are signs of adaptation to mammals, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday. In experimental animal studies, the mutations, both of which are in what is known as the PB2 gene, have previously been shown to help the virus replicate better in mammalian cells. The risk to the public remains low, health officials said, and no additional human cases have been linked to the Chilean man, who remains hospitalized. Moreover, the sample was missing other critical genetic changes that scientists believe would be necessary for the virus, known as H5N1, to spread efficiently among humans, including mutations that would stabilize the virus and help it bind more tightly to human cells. 'There are three major categories of changes we think H5 has to undergo to switch from being a bird virus to being a human virus,' said Richard J. Webby, a bird flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. 'The sequences from the person in Chile have one of those classes of changes. But we also know that of those three sets of changes, this is the easiest one for the virus to make.' PB2 mutations have been found in other mammals infected with this version of the virus, as well as in some people infected with other versions of H5N1. The mutations most likely emerged in the Chilean patient over the course of his infection, experts said. 'We understand them to be a step on the path to adaptation to humans and increased risk to humans,' said Anice C. Lowen, an influenza virologist at Emory University. 'So certainly it's concerning to see them.' But these mutations alone are probably not sufficient to produce a virus that spreads easily among humans, she added. 'Those genetic changes have been seen previously with past H5N1 infections, and have not resulted in spread between people,' Vivien Dugan, acting director of the influenza division at the C.D.C.'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a statement. 'Nevertheless, it's important to continue to look carefully at every instance of human infection, as well as other mammalian spillover events, and to track viral evolution in birds,' Dr. Dugan said. 'We need to remain vigilant for changes that would make these viruses more dangerous to people.' The sample was sequenced by the National Influenza Center in Chile and uploaded to GISAID, an international database of viral genomes, overnight, C.D.C. officials said. Chile's Ministry of Health reported the case to the World Health Organization on March 29. The patient, a 53-year-old man, developed respiratory symptoms, including a cough and a sore throat, and was hospitalized when his condition deteriorated, according to the W.H.O. Investigation into the case is continuing, and how the man became infected remains unclear. But the virus had recently been detected in birds and sea lions in the region where the man lives. 'According to the preliminary findings of the local epidemiological investigation, the most plausible hypothesis about transmission is that it occurred through environmental exposure to areas where either sick or dead birds or sea mammals were found close to the residence of the case,' the W.H.O. reported last week. It is the 11th reported human case of H5N1 since January 2022, according to the C.D.C., none of which have been associated with human-to-human transmission. Since H5N1 was first detected in birds in 1996, there have been hundreds of human infections globally, mostly in people who were in close contact with birds. Still, experts have long been worried about the possibility that avian influenza, which is well adapted to birds, might evolve to spread more easily among humans, potentially setting off another pandemic. An H5N1 outbreak on a Spanish mink farm last fall suggests that the virus is capable of adapting to spread more efficiently among at least some mammals. And every human infection gives the virus more opportunities to adapt. The mutations documented in the Chilean patient are a 'step in the wrong direction,' Dr. Lowen said. This version of the virus has spread rapidly through wild birds in the Americas, sparking regular outbreaks in farmed poultry. The virus has become so widespread in birds that it has repeatedly spilled over into mammals, and 'continued sporadic human infections are anticipated,' the C.D.C. wrote in a recent technical report.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "deny_statement_3", "statement": "Those genetic changes have been seen previously with past H5N1 infections, and have not resulted in spread between people."}]}
{"id": "306", "fulltext": "A species that conservationists once saved from the brink of extinction is now facing a new powerful threat: avian flu. In a little more than a month, 21 critically endangered California condors have died of avian flu, according to a Friday news release from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The disease has been found in northern Arizona, among the bird's Southwest flock, which straddles the Arizona-Utah border, says the service. Avian flu has not yet been confirmed among any condors in Utah, California, or Baja California, Mexico. The deceased birds, which officials counted from March 30 to May 5, included eight breeding pairs, according to the news release. Four condors with avian flu are currently recovering at Liberty Wildlife, an Arizona wildlife rescue. The deaths have likely set conservation efforts back by a decade or more, the Peregrine Fund, which manages the Southwest flock, told CNN in an email. \"Because the Condor is slow to mature, taking up to eight years before they can produce young, and with an average of one young every other year,\" even a single loss in the wild can have \"a big impact,\" said Chris Parish, the non-profit's president and CEO. \"This will change recovery as we know it.\" \"We will need to double down on causes of mortality that we can control or change rates of, like lead poisoning, and be better prepared with (hopefully) vaccines and greater infrastructure to respond to events like this in the future,\" he went on. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has said it was working to manage the outbreak and may consider vaccinating the endangered birds. The Peregrine Fund added it wasn't sure how influenza entered the condor population. The organization explained that condors are important to preserve because they \"provide a critical ecological service\" by \"eating dead animals that can be a source of disease transmission to other wildlife, livestock, and even humans.\" The species are also considered sacred to the Yurok Tribe, California's largest Native American tribe. The condors, which are one of the world's largest birds with a wingspan of 9.5 feet, almost went extinct in the 1980s, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. By 1987, the tiny population of condors left in the wild was placed into a captive breeding program in an attempt to bring the species back from the brink. In 1992, the service began releasing captive-born condors into the wild. The population has slowly started to bounce back: As of 2020, there were a total of 504 condors in the world with 175 living in captivity and 329 living in the wild, according to a report from the Department of the Interior. But they still face serious threats, including lead poisoning, which the birds contract after scavenging on animals that have been shot with lead ammunition. Experts have said this may be one of the deadliest outbreaks of avian flu ever in the US. The disease has affected almost 60,000 captive poultry across 47 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Risk to humans is limited -- only one human infection has been detected in the US, says the CDC.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "The organization explained that condors are important to preserve because they 'provide a critical ecological service' by 'eating dead animals that can be a source of disease transmission to other wildlife, livestock, and even humans.'"}]}
{"id": "309", "fulltext": "LONDON (AP) — Two poultry workers in the U.K. have tested positive for bird flu, but they had no symptoms and there's no evidence of transmission between people, the Health Security Agency said Tuesday. The two are the first humans to test positive for the virus in the U.K. since the agency announced a case of a 79-year-old English man who was infected after allowing ducks into his home. The agency said bird-to-human transmission of avian flu had occurred in the U.K. only a small number of times prior to that January 2022 infection. The poultry workers who tested positive for the H5 strain were believed to have been exposed to sick birds while working at the same farm, which was not identified. Poultry farms were under order from November until mid-April to keep all birds indoors after avian flu was discovered on dozens of farms. Since October 2021, the U.K. has faced its worst outbreak of avian influenza, with hundreds of cases confirmed and millions of birds culled. The positive tests were detected through screening of poultry workers exposed to infected birds. The two workers have since tested negative. Precautionary contact tracing was being done, the agency said. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the agency, said the level of risk to human health from bird flu was very low in the general population. \"Current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we're seeing circulating in birds around the world do not spread easily to people,\" Hopkins said. \"Globally, there is no evidence of spread of this strain from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population.\"", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_2", "statement": "Current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we're seeing circulating in birds around the world do not spread easily to people."}]}
{"id": "311", "fulltext": "Federal officials have granted emergency approval to a bird flu vaccine for use in California condors, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on Tuesday. The move comes after more than a dozen of the birds, which are critically endangered, recently died from the virus, known as H5N1. Worldwide, there are fewer than 600 California condors, which can have wingspans of nearly 10 feet. The emergency approval is an attempt to prevent additional deaths of these birds, said the agency, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The vaccine was initially developed for a different version of avian influenza, and the condors will not begin receiving it right away. Three federal agencies—the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey—are now working together to test the vaccine in black vultures, a species related to California condors. Twenty vultures in North Carolina received the shots on Tuesday, the agencies said in a joint email. If the results are promising, the next step will be to vaccinate 25 captive condors, they said. Why It Matters: Condors are at high risk. The virus was first detected in a California condor found dead in late March. Since then, 20 more condors have died and four additional condors are currently in rehabilitation facilities, according to the federal agency. The virus has been confirmed in 15 of those birds. Condors appear to be highly susceptible to the virus, said Dr. Carlos Sanchez, the head veterinarian at the Oregon Zoo, which has a condor breeding program. Once they get it, he said, they tend to have high mortality. California condor populations dropped precipitously during the 20th century; in the 1980s, fewer than 30 birds were left. In the decades since, captive breeding programs have helped the population recover. If the virus gets into more condor populations, it could erase this progress, Dr. Sanchez said: We're talking about a potential catastrophic collapse of the conservation project. Background: A new version of an old threat. The H5N1 virus was first detected in China in 1996. Since then, various versions of the virus have circulated in wild birds and caused repeated outbreaks in poultry. A new version of the virus arrived in North America in late 2021. Since then, it has spread rapidly throughout the United States, causing the largest bird flu outbreak in the nation's history and resulting in the death of almost 60 million farmed birds. It has also taken a far heavier toll on wild birds than previous outbreaks. It has been detected in more than 6,700 wild birds—a figure that is surely an underestimate—in every state but Hawaii and has resulted in mass die-offs of wild birds around the world. It has also repeatedly spilled over into mammals and caused a small number of human infections, generally in people who were known to have been in close contact with birds. The virus is best adapted to birds, and the threat to the general public remains low, officials say. But scientists have long been concerned that the virus could evolve in ways that help it spread easily among people. What's next: Officials are considering a broader bird vaccination campaign. The small size of the existing California condor population will allow the vaccination program to be monitored closely, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said. Federal officials have not authorized the vaccine for use in other birds. But the size and scope of the current outbreak have prompted officials to consider a mass poultry vaccination campaign. U.S.D.A. scientists have been testing numerous potential poultry vaccines and have said that some results could be available this spring. The country could see more animal outbreaks in the coming weeks as infected wild birds migrate north for the summer.

{"id": "326", "fulltext": "At bird breeding grounds this spring and summer, the skies have been clearer and quieter, the flocks drastically thinned. Last year, more than 60 percent of the Caspian terns at Lake Michigan vanished; the flock of great skuas at the Hermaness reserve, in Scotland, may have shrunk by 90 percent. Now more broken bodies are turning up: a massacre of 600 arctic-tern chicks in the United Kingdom; a rash of pelicans, cormorants, gulls, and terns washed up along West African coasts. In recent months, Peruvian officials have reported the loss of tens of thousands of pelicans—by some estimates, up to 40 percent of the country's total population. The deaths are the latest casualties of the outbreak of H5N1 avian flu that's been tearing its way across the world. In the past couple of years, more than 100 million domestic poultry have died, many of them deliberately culled; out in the wild, the deaths may be in the millions too—the corpses have just been too inaccessible and too numerous for scientists to count. \"It's been carnage,\" Michelle Wille, a virologist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, told me. \"For many species, we are losing decades of conservation work.\" For months, experts worried most about the outbreak's magnitude—it struck so swiftly and lethally that it's become the most deadly H5N1 epidemic recorded in North America. Now the looming concern is length: when, and if, the virus will withdraw. History would seem to be on our side, at least in North America: Earlier versions of avian flu that made it to this side of the world flamed out within a year or two, quashed by the ebb and flow of migrating hosts and by concerted poultry culls. But this new strain is stubborn, pounding the continent more or less continuously. \"That has never happened before,\" Vijaykrishna Dhanasekaran, a virologist at Hong Kong University, told me. Read: Eagles are falling, bears are going blind The situation has grown dire enough that last month, the United States began, for the first time in history, to offer avian-flu vaccines to birds—starting with critically endangered California condors, which have lost more than 20 members of their very small population to the virus and cannot afford more, Ashleigh Blackford, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's California-condor coordinator, told me. This choice is one of many grim and tacit acknowledgments that this virus is now so entrenched that it's almost certain to circulate here indefinitely. The longer the virus lingers, the greater the chance that it will pose a different danger: permanent tenancy among mammals, a group that, historically, the virus has not easily infected and spread among. Some experts worry that the virus has now managed to establish new methods of transmission in select communities of mink and foxes on fur farms, and maybe in wild seals. The chances of an outbreak among people—certainly, of another pandemic—are still, in absolute terms, low, Nádia Trovão, a virologist at the Fogarty International Center, told me. But the more new places H5N1 establishes itself for good, the more its threat to us will grow. Scientists can't yet say why this particular flu virus has found such unprecedented success in North America, only that it has. In the two years since its arrival, it has infiltrated more birds and mammals—including species not previously known to be vulnerable to avian flus—than has any other pathogen of its ilk. Among the most affected creatures have been wild birds, a major departure from previous strains that primarily attacked poultry. And although past viruses in this family have been relatively slow to evolve, this one keeps amping up its genetic diversity by mixing its genome with bits of other bird-borne flus—tweaks that may be helping H5N1 find even more new hosts and execute further genomic changes still.

In certain parts of the U.S. and Europe, case counts in the wild seem to be slumping. And scientists are stumbling upon gannets in Scotland carrying antibodies to the virus—and whose eyes have, in the aftermath of presumed infection, bizarrely changed color from blue to black. Wendy Puryear, a virologist at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, is now searching for similar hints of immunity in gray seals. Should this pattern continue, there's hope that the virus, at least in this part of the world, could \"just fizzle out,\" Dhanasekaran said. Wille and other researchers, though, are looking toward autumn with a degree of dread. Another surge of disease could appear then, especially as seasonal migrations return birds to their overwintering homes. Even without a fall comeback, the math is against elimination in North America, where the virus has infiltrated well over 100 species. At this point, H5N1 lingering in at least some creatures seems far likelier than a full and permanent retreat. For people, the news is still, tentatively, okay. \"In its current form, the virus has very, very low transmissibility to humans,\" with just a handful of cases detected, says Ian Barr, the deputy director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza. But the list of mammals catching the virus is still growing. In some of these outbreaks, the root cause is likely avian, experts told me: cats eating raw poultry; raccoons, skunks, and other scavengers presumably snarfing the carcasses of infected birds. Other cases, though—seals at sea, foxes and mink crowded into fur farms—seem better explained by mammals catching H5N1 directly from another of their own kind. Given the sheer number of animals involved, \"it's hard to fathom that each was individually exposed to an infected bird,\" Louise Moncla, an avian-influenza expert at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. Read: We vaccinate animals more than ourselves Since the virus arrived in North America, it also appears to have become deadlier, with particularly devastating effects when it infiltrates certain creatures' brains, Richard Webby, a virologist and the director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, told me. Fox kits have been found racked with tremors; bears have gone partially blind. To truly transform into an even worse scourge, the virus would need to shape-shift from a pathogen that primarily plagues bird guts into one that could easily infiltrate mammalian lungs. The virus has already taken at least one step toward that: Researchers sampling H5N1-infected mammals, including foxes, mink, cats, seals, and even a person, have detected genetic tweaks that are helping the microbe replicate inside mammalian cells. But a boost in infective capability alone isn't enough for a large-scale outbreak, Webby said. The virus would probably need to circumvent some mammal-specific immune defenses. And it would certainly need to acquire the ability to more efficiently transmit between mammalian hosts via, say, an airborne route. There's not yet evidence, Webby told me, that the virus has pulled off such changes, though just a few might suffice: better binding to receptors on mammalian lung cells, a more stable structure so it could travel via aerosol. That said, the criteria for properly mammalizing a flu virus \"are not really well understood,\" Moncla said. All that's certain is that the chasm between birds and mammals is not uncrossable. No single intervention will quash H5N1's potential pandemic threat. Avian-flu vaccines have been developed for humans, but for now, Trovão, of the Fogarty International Center, told me, the priority is keeping the virus out of cramped, often unsanitary communities of mammals where it could rack up further mutations. Vaccinating poultry, too, would help, says Mariette Ducatez, a virologist at the National Veterinary School of Toulouse. The practice is already relatively common in countries where avian influenza is endemic, including China, Egypt, and Vietnam. This fall, France is likely to introduce shots for a subset of its domesticated birds; regulators in the U.S. have mulled eventually doing the same. But avian-flu vaccines can be expensive, difficult to administer, and better at tempering disease severity than blocking spread. Without vigilant monitoring, the virus could spread silently in vaccinated flocks, especially those with spotty coverage, where the microbe could be pressured to evolve in new ways. On the global market, many poultry buyers are also reluctant to import vaccinated birds. The stakes for vaccinating wild animals are less economic but no less fraught. And although researchers believe that the recently inoculated California condors are tolerating the new shots well, other species aren't necessarily next in line. In most cases, vaccinating wild animals just isn't practical, Trovão told me. Even for the condors, which are already closely monitored by scientists and used to frequent human contact, shots are \"not sustainable, really, not long term,\" Samantha Gibbs, a wildlife veterinarian at U.S. Fish and Wildlife, told me. Scientists still can't say for sure how well the vaccines will work in the birds or how long protection might last. \"This was a last resort,\" Gibbs said, \"just an attempt to get them through this.\" But with H5N1 still raging and the birds still vulnerable, Gibbs and her team suspect that they'll have little choice but to continue vaccinating the condors on an annual basis.

{"id": "334", "fulltext": "Scientists confirm three birds have died from virus as park authorities redouble efforts to protect islands' endemic birds National park authorities on the Galápagos Islands have heightened biosecurity measures to protect the archipelago's unique fauna from the deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza after scientists confirmed that three birds had died from the virus. 'From preliminary tests of the five specimens, three of them have tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza,' Danny Rueda, director of the Galápagos national park told the Guardian. Two frigate birds and one red-footed booby were confirmed to have died from the virus on Tuesday, after samples were sent to Guayaquil on the Ecuadorian mainland for examination. Park guards and veterinarians are redoubling efforts to protect the islands' 58 species of endemic and native birds, including flightless cormorants, the only species of penguin in the northern hemisphere and one of the largest albatross colonies in the world. The Galápagos Islands' unique bird species were observed by Charles Darwin in 1835 when he visited the isolated archipelago on HMS Beagle and helped him set out his theory of evolution by natural selection in On the Origin of Species. They are considered particularly vulnerable due to their low immunity, small populations and the effect of rising ocean temperatures. Scientists say the virus was probably brought to the islands by migratory birds. Last year, Ecuador declared an emergency due to outbreaks of avian influenza on farms. In neighbouring Peru, the highly contagious virus ripped through seabird populations, killing as many as 200,000 as well as decimating marine mammals such as sea lions. The Galápagos national park activated emergency health protocols on Sunday following the report of dozens of dead and sick birds on two islands, Wolf and Genovesa, in the northern part of the Pacific archipelago, which lies about 1,000km from the South American continent. Rueda said red-footed boobies were showing a 'higher number of dead birds but also more symptoms [such as] erratic behaviour' characteristic of bird flu. Two visitor sites were closed on Española Island, the only place where the critically endangered waved albatross breeds, though there were no confirmed cases of the birds with the virus. 'Our main worry is for the endemic species,' said Rueda. 'Their populations are quite small and are restricted to the Galápagos.' 'It is very worrying to find a dead bird or a bird that has given a positive result, so we have to triple the biosecurity efforts on tourist boats, for tourists and crew members,' he said. Gustavo Jiménez, principal investigator for the Charles Darwin Foundation, said many species including boobies, albatross and the endangered Galápagos penguin were facing scarcer food sources due to El Niño, and the resulting stress made them more susceptible to pathogens such as avian flu. 'The endemic species are very sensitive to any disease,' he said. 'Our best defence is prevention.' Scientists also fear that, as it has on the mainland, the virus could jump to endangered Galápagos sea lions and fur seals. A warning has been issued calling on tourists visiting the Unesco Natural Heritage of Humanity site not to try to touch affected birds. Avian influenza can be transmitted to humans. Federico Angermeyer, a tour operator in the archipelago, said the disease's landfall could hurt tourism, the islands' principal economic activity.

{"id": "341", "fulltext": "LONDON—In this case, it was neither the chicken nor the egg that came first. Rather, it started with some specially engineered cells in a lab. The chicken cells had had their genomes edited, not to correct a faulty mutation, but in an effort to blunt the bird flu virus. The chickens that were bred from those cells were designed to be resistant to the infection. The experiment was a sign of the times. A highly pathogenic strain of that flu has swept to nearly every corner of the globe in recent years and left an unprecedented wave of death in its wake, decimating both wild and farmed birds and tipping into mammals as well. While farmers trying to protect poultry have turned to isolating farmed birds from wild birds—no more ranging free for those chickens—and, increasingly, to vaccination, scientists in the U.K. on Tuesday offered up the idea of stitching immunity to influenza into chickens’ DNA. In a way, the research is an extension of humanity’s long history of enhancing certain traits in crops and farm animals, though with a decidedly 21st-century twist. In the paper, published in Nature Communications, the researchers described using the genome-editor CRISPR to alter a protein in chicken cells that flu hijacks to make copies of itself. If the virus can’t take over that protein, the idea goes, it can’t establish an infection. The results were promising: Almost all the chickens with the edited protein rebuffed a level of virus that the research team said approximated the flu exposure a chicken would encounter from a sick coop-mate or an infected wild bird drawn to a fowl farm to pilfer some feed. The edited chickens showed no health or developmental issues and laid eggs in typical numbers. Related: Bird flu researchers turn to Finland’s mink farms, tracking a virus with pandemic potential. But the researchers set themselves a higher bar, and tested an extremely high dose of flu that caused a number of breakthrough infections in the CRISPR’d chickens. Out of concern that any virus that managed to circumvent the CRISPR’d immunity could harbor potentially dangerous mutations, the scientists said they wanted to demonstrate complete infection protection in the birds even against such high levels of flu before attempting to roll them out. To reach that threshold, the researchers are now pursuing further experiments that involve editing three genes, not just one. “We felt that it would be the responsible thing to be more rigorous to stress test this and ask, are these chickens truly resistant?” said Imperial College London virologist Wendy Barclay, one of the senior authors on the paper. “What if they were to somehow encounter a much, much higher dose?” With additional research needed, the paper is more proof of concept than immediate proposal, but the authors were already thinking about whether people would consider frying up some tenders or scrambling some eggs from an edited bird. As it is, genetically modified crops and animals continue to face resistance among some groups. “It’s not just enough to develop the technology,” said Alewo Idoko-Akoh, the first author of the paper and a research associate at the University of Bristol, who used to work as a veterinarian in his native Nigeria. “It’s got to be done in such a way that it’s culturally sensitive and also acceptable.” No chicken has been found to be naturally immune to the H5N1 avian flu strain that’s been spreading across the world; it’s not as if chicken farms could selectively breed for such a trait. Instead, scientists at the University of Edinburgh where Idoko-Akoh formerly worked got the idea of CRISPR’ing it in. For their target, they selected the ANP32 family of genes that encode proteins that Barclay and her group have shown are essential for flu to make copies of itself inside cells. “It occurred to us that if you could disrupt that interaction in some way, if you could prevent the protein from being used, perhaps by this gene editing, then the virus would not be able to replicate,” Barclay said. Specifically, the researchers used CRISPR to make tiny tweaks to the ANP32A gene. They performed the edits in the lab in cells that go on to form eggs and sperm, and then injected those cells into chicken embryos developing in eggs. The embryos took up the edited cells, went on to hatch, and then those chickens were later mated with each other. All their offspring, in turn, inherited the edited ANP32A gene. The researchers then put their CRISPR’d chickens up against regular birds as they exposed them to flu. (For the experiments, the researchers didn’t use H5N1, but rather a less pathogenic bird flu called H9N2.) In their first test, they challenged the birds with a level of virus—1,000 infectious units—that they estimated replicated what the birds would encounter during a farm outbreak. While all of the control birds were infected, nine out of 10 of the edited birds were able to block infection. The tenth shed comparatively little virus for a short period of time, the researchers reported. In the next round, the researchers tried an extremely high flu dose—1 million infectious units. All the control birds were infected, but this time, half of the edited chickens were also infected, though they had lower viral levels and were less likely to transmit the virus on than the control birds. The researchers said it wasn’t clear exactly how the virus was able to infect the edited birds, but sequencing showed the viruses from the breakthrough infections had picked up some mutations. The fear is that if a gene-edited approach to blunting bird flu can’t prevent infections entirely, it could pressure the virus to evolve in ways that could make it a better spreader than it already is, particularly among mammals. Experts have worried about H5N1 spreading among people and igniting a pandemic since the virus was discovered 25 years ago, and though it would take multiple changes to the virus’s genome to do that, scientists want to make sure they’re not boosting it even one rung up that ladder. “If this was a disease that only infected chickens, yes, then the resistance we created would be better than what we would get with a vaccine,” said Mike McGrew, a senior author on the paper and a group leader at the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute. “But because this is a zoonotic disease, and can be spread potentially to humans, we really need to aim for complete resistance. Not resilience, resistance, so the virus cannot grow in the chickens.” In an effort to generate sterilizing immunity—that is, blocking infections entirely—the researchers are now experimenting with editing a total of three genes in the ANP32 family. Their lab tests have shown the combined approach generates stronger protection, though they haven’t yet made chickens with the edits for further testing as well as to make sure the edits don’t have any health impacts on the chickens. Benjamin Schusser, a professor of reproductive biotechnology at the Technical University of Munich, who was not involved with the new research, said he agreed with the paper’s authors that they needed to demonstrate sterilizing immunity before the chickens could ever be used. Having viruses that pick up mutations as they cause breakthrough infections “gets dangerous, for animals and for humans.” “This is a great piece of work showing there might be ways to do it, but it requires much more research to do it,” Schusser said. The researchers, who have submitted a patent application on the work, framed the gene-editing strategy as an alternative to vaccination. While some governments have grown receptive to vaccination campaigns as the toll of bird flu mounts, some have resisted out of concerns that immunizing birds could render them asymptomatic, but not protected from infection. The fear is that the virus would spread without notice, or that an infected bird could unknowingly be imported by another country. France, for example, recently started vaccinating millions of ducks, and the United States responded by restricting imports of the birds. Vaccines face other limitations. Flu viruses evolve quickly, so they could mutate in ways that allow them to outrun vaccine-generated protection. If the CRISPR approach were proven out, experts say integrating the protective edits into the world’s billions of chickens would be feasible, though it could take some time. A small number of breeding companies supply much of the world’s Gallus gallus domesticus, so it would involve introducing the edits to the pedigree birds at the top of the companies’ “breeding pyramids,” and then waiting as the trait passed down through future generations. The U.K. team is not alone in exploring the use of CRISPR in farm animals to protect them from diseases or adapt them to changing climates. Already, Czech researchers in 2020 described CRISPR’ing chickens to make them resistant to avian leukosis virus. “I definitely see it as an extension of breeding tools,” Irina Polejaeva, a professor of developmental biology at Utah State University, who was not involved in the new research, said about gene editing. “Spontaneous natural mutations responsible for specific traits were identified over the previous centuries and amplified by selective breeding, leading to a generation of specialized livestock and poultry breeds. Gene editing is a new high-precision tool that can introduce specific beneficial traits.” Lawmakers and regulators around the world are starting to think more about how to handle these technologies. In the U.S., regulators have cleared CRISPR’d cows with shorter hair to help them withstand higher temperatures; there are also genetically engineered salmon and pigs on the market. The U.K. passed legislation earlier this year that opens the door to gene-edited crops and livestock. Japan has authorized the sale of CRISPR’d fish as food. “I think the world is changing,” said Helen Sang of the University of Edinburgh, another author on the new paper. “Countries are bringing in new legislation to bring in regulations that will look at the safety of gene-edited animals for food, and within a few years, there will be the regulations in place. And the biology will follow along behind.”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_4", "statement": "Having viruses that pick up mutations as they cause breakthrough infections 'gets dangerous, for animals and for humans.'"}]}
{"id": "352", "fulltext": "(CNN) - The first cases of bird flu have been detected in seabirds in the Antarctic, according to the British Antarctic Survey, raising fears the disease will spread rapidly through dense colonies of birds and mammals. \"Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has been confirmed in brown skua populations on Bird Island, South Georgia - the first known cases in the Antarctic region,\" the British Antarctic Survey said in a statement Monday. South Georgia is part of the British overseas territory east of South America's tip and just above Antarctica's main landmass. The British Antarctic Survey believes the birds carried the disease on their return from migration to South America. In August this year, OFFLU - an open network of global avian influenza experts - warned of a \"substantial risk\" of a southward spread of the HPAI H5 virus from South America, where it was first detected in October 2022. In a report published August 23, OFFLU warned that the disease could reach Antarctica and its offshore islands \"due to the spring migration of wild birds from South America to breeding sites in the Antarctic.\" It pointed to \"immense\" negative impact on the Antarctic wild birds and mammal population due to \"their likely susceptibility to mortality from this virus, and their occurrence in dense colonies of up to thousands of pinnipeds and hundreds of thousands of birds, allowing efficient virus transmission.\" Bird flu is caused by infections that occur naturally among wild aquatic birds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infected birds can transmit the virus to other animals through their saliva and other bodily discharges. Antarctica and its offshore islands are home to \"more than 100 million breeding birds, six species of pinnipeds and 17 species of cetaceans,\" according to OFFLU, which warns of the possibility of \"efficient virus transmission\" in the region. One of the key objectives of OFFLU, which was founded jointly in 2005 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Organisation for Animal Health, is to gather data on the viruses and analyze disease patterns. The British Antarctic Survey, which is responsible for the UK's national scientific activities in Antarctica, operates two research stations on South Georgia, including one at Bird Island where the confirmed cases were identified. These unprecedented cases come as several countries have experienced record outbreaks of bird flu this year. In Japan, just under 10 million birds were killed to limit the spread of the disease, putting strain on the supply of poultry and sending the price of eggs soaring.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "It pointed to 'immense' negative impact on the Antarctic wild birds and mammal population due to 'their likely susceptibility to mortality from this virus, and their occurrence in dense colonies of up to thousands of pinnipeds and hundreds of thousands of birds, allowing efficient virus transmission.'"}]}
{"id": "385", "fulltext": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Avian influenza is killing tens of thousands of seals and sea lions in different corners of the world, disrupting ecosystems and flummoxing scientists who don't see a clear way to slow the devastating virus. The worldwide bird flu outbreak that began in 2020 has led to the deaths of millions of domesticated birds and spread to wildlife all over the globe. This virus isn't thought to be a major threat to humans, but its spread in farming operations and wild ecosystems has caused widespread economic turmoil and environmental disruptions. Seals and sea lions, in places as far apart as Maine and Chile, appear to be especially vulnerable to the disease, scientists said. The virus has been detected in seals on the east and west coasts of the U.S., leading to deaths of more than 300 seals in New England and a handful more in Puget Sound in Washington. The situation is even more dire in South America, where more than 20,000 sea lions have died in Chile and Peru and thousands of elephant seals have died in Argentina. The virus can be controlled in domesticated animals, but it can spread unchecked in wildlife and marine mammals such as South America's seals that lacked prior exposure to it have suffered devastating consequences, said Marcela Uhart, director of the Latin America program at the Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center at the University of California, Davis. \"Once the virus is in wildlife, it spreads like wildfire, as long as there are susceptible animals and species,\" Uhart said. \"Movement of animals spreads the virus to new areas.\" Scientists are still researching how the seals have contracted bird flu, but it is most likely from contact with infected seabirds, Uhart said. High mortality has affected South American marine mammals consistently since the virus arrived late in 2022, and birds in Peru and Chile have died by the hundreds of thousands from the virus since then, she noted. The virus is still spreading and was detected in mainland Antarctica for the first time in February. The deaths of seals and sea lions disrupts ecosystems where the marine mammals serve as key predators near the top of the food chain. Seals help keep the ocean in balance by preventing overpopulation of the fish species they feed on. Many species affected, such as South American sea lions and Southern elephant seals, have relatively stable populations, but scientists worry about the possibility of the virus jumping to more jeopardized animals. Scientists have said bird flu might have played a role in the deaths of hundreds of endangered Caspian seals in Russia last year. \"The loss of wildlife at the current scale presents an unprecedented risk of wildlife population collapse, creating an ecological crisis,\" the World Organisation for Animal Health, an intergovernmental organization, said in a statement. In New England, scientists with the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University found an outbreak of bird flu that killed more than 330 harbor and gray seals along the North Atlantic coast in 2022 turned out to be worse than initially thought. It's possible the seals contracted the virus from gulls by coming into contact with sick gulls' excrement or by preying on an infected bird, the scientists reported. The U.S. government determined the seal die-off was an \"unusual mortality event\" attributable to bird flu. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has declared the event is over, but concerns remain about a possible repeat. \"Marine mammals are still pretty unique in the scale of the outbreaks that are occurring,\" said Wendy Puryear, an author of the Tufts study. \"One of the connections is there is a lot of virus that circulates in coastal birds. A lot of opportunities for those wild birds to host the virus and pass it on to marine mammals.\" Some scientists and environmental advocates say there could be a link between the outbreaks and climate change and warming oceans. Warmer sea temperatures off northern Chile decrease the population of forage fish, and that makes sea lions weaker and more susceptible to disease, said Liesbeth van der Meer, director of the environmental group Oceana in Chile. Scientists and environmentalists are hopeful vaccinating poultry will help lessen the spread of the disease, van der Meer said, adding that it's also important for people to avoid potentially infected animals in the wild. \"Authorities have carried out campaigns about the disease, strongly recommending to stay away from seabirds or marine mammals with symptoms or found dead in the coastal areas,\" van der Meer said. Even seals in aquariums are not considered completely safe from bird flu. The New England Aquarium, where outdoor harbor seal exhibits delight thousands of visitors every year, has taken strict sanitation precautions to prevent transmission of the virus to its animals, said Melissa Joblon, the Boston aquarium's director of animal health. Staff aren't allowed to bring backyard poultry products to the aquarium, and an awning protects the seal exhibit from birds that could carry the virus, she said. \"We do know that it's a risk for the animals that reside here,\" said Joblon, adding that none of the aquarium's seals have been infected. The deaths of marine mammals are even more concerning because of mutations of the avian virus, according to a paper in the journal Nature Communications last fall. The mutations \"warrant further examination and highlight an urgent need for active local surveillance to manage outbreaks and limit spillover into other species, including humans,\" the study stated. Another study, published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases in February, found the bird flu virus has adapted to spread between birds and mammals. Researchers found nearly identical samples of the virus in dead sea lions, a dead seal and a dead seabird. They said the finding is significant because it confirms a multispecies outbreak that can affect marine mammals and birds. More seal deaths could disrupt critical ecosystems around the world, said Lynda Doughty, executive director of Marine Mammals of Maine, a marine mammal rescue organization that responded to seals with bird flu during the New England outbreak. \"You need this happy ecosystem. If we're taking out some important species, what is the trickle down effect of that? That's the million dollar question,\" Doughty said. ___ Follow Patrick Whittle on X, formerly Twitter: @pxwhittle Eds: UPDATES: Links audio.

{"id": "387", "fulltext": "Asymptomatic cases may seem reassuring for the penguins, but scientists fear they could act as 'Trojan horses' for other species. Adélie penguins in Antarctica are testing positive for bird flu without showing outward signs of disease, according to researchers who travelled around 13 remote breeding sites on an ice-breaking cruise ship. Since bird flu arrived in the region this year, there have been concerns about the virus reaching the Antarctic's fragile penguin populations. In November last year, researchers warned in a pre-print research paper that if the virus caused mass mortality in these colonies, 'it could signal one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times.' In December 2023 and January 2024, scientists tested 16 Adélie penguins on Beagle Island in the Antarctic Peninsula for H5N1, and seven (43%) tested positive. Satellite trackers on the penguins showed they were alive and foraging as normal two months later in early March 2024. At another site on Red Rock Ridge, nine Adélie penguins were tested and one tested positive. None showed any sign of disease, which is good news for the penguins, but researchers warn they could act as 'Trojan horses,' facilitating the spread of the virus to vulnerable species. 'These asymptomatic cases may seem reassuring for the species in question, but they have strong implications for Antarctic wildlife in general, potentially leading to unnoticed and widespread virus transmission,' wrote researchers, led by Fabiola León from UC Chile, in the bioRxiv paper, which has yet to be peer-reviewed. Their findings are cause for 'some cautious optimism for penguin populations,' says Colin Butter, an associate professor of bioveterinary sciences at the University of Lincoln, who was not involved in the research. While it is possible some penguin populations could be resistant, this cannot be known for certain, as many other penguin species have died in South America. Bird flu's widespread distribution across Antarctica would also threaten other populations, including seals and whales. 'The Antarctic ecosystem is precious and fragile. Influenza virus could cause devastating disruption from which it will not recover,' Butter said. Ed Hutchinson, a molecular biologist from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, who was also not involved in the paper, said the limited sampling meant this survey only provided a snapshot of what was happening. 'The fact that apparently healthy birds were found to be infected with influenza viruses is really important, but it is not surprising,' he said. 'We know from elsewhere in the world that some types of bird are more likely to become severely ill with this virus than others. As the spread of coronavirus in humans reminded us, the presence of healthy but infectious individuals can be a real problem in controlling the spread of an outbreak. This study highlights the importance of continued monitoring of this.' Dr. Connor Bamford, a virologist from Queen's University Belfast, said he was cautious about the findings. 'More work is needed to study these animals with regard to avian influenza in sickness and in health. High mortalities associated with highly pathogenic H5 have been documented in penguins in the past. However, the reasons why these penguins appear to be protected, and its implications, are hard to say.' The testing between December 2023 and January 2024 was conducted along the east and west coasts of the Antarctic Peninsula and Antarctic western coast. It provides a snapshot of how the virus is spreading in the continent. In total, 115 seemingly healthy birds were sampled, and nine tested positive, including eight Adélie penguins and one Antarctic shag. Researchers tested 31 emperor penguins and none tested positive. It is not possible to say if the virus had reached these colonies and was no longer present, or if these birds had not been exposed to it at all. Bird flu was first confirmed on Antarctica's mainland in February, after a number of cases in the sub-Antarctic islands. The paper's researchers said: 'The first-time detection of suspected cases of H5N1 influenza in penguins and cormorants in the Antarctic continent marks a significant expansion into this isolated continent and puts highly vulnerable bird populations at risk.' The spread of H5N1 has caused millions of wild birds to die globally, with thousands of sea lions and seals also dying from 'spillover' events into wild mammals. After its arrival in the sub-Antarctic in October, there have been mortalities in about 10 species of Antarctic seabirds and seals.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_3", "statement": "'As the spread of coronavirus in humans reminded us, the presence of healthy but infectious individuals can be a real problem in controlling the spread of an outbreak.

{"id": "394", "fulltext": "A highly virulent bird flu first detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas this week has spread to additional herds, bringing the number of affected states to five and adding evidence the virus may be spreading cow-to-cow. The strain has been confirmed in Michigan, and presumptive positive tests have been reported from Idaho and New Mexico, federal officials said Friday. Earlier in the day, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported incorrectly that presumptive positive tests had also been found in Ohio. The presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as HPAI, has been confirmed in a Michigan dairy herd that recently received cows from Texas, according to a statement Friday from the USDA. The virus strain found in Michigan is similar to a strain confirmed in Texas and Kansas that appears to have been introduced by wild birds, the USDA statement said. \"Spread of symptoms among the Michigan herd also indicates that HPAI transmission between cattle cannot be ruled out,\" according to the USDA statement. Initial testing has not identified changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans, according to the USDA. \"While cases among humans in direct contact with infected animals are possible, this indicates that the current risk to the public remains low,\" the agency statement said. Idaho officials announced Thursday that avian flu was detected at a dairy cattle farm in Cassia County after the facility recently imported livestock from another state that had identified HPAI in cows. It did not provide details. But in an interview, state veterinarian Scott Leibsle said avian flu was detected in the Idaho cattle after the farm imported cows from a Texas herd that had shown symptoms of HPAI. \"Cow-to-cow transmission is definitely playing a role in how this disease progresses. To what extent, we don't know yet,\" Leibsle said. It's clear that infected wild birds spread the disease to herds in Texas and Kansas, he said. \"But the herd of cattle that came up from Texas to Idaho, the birds didn't follow,\" the state veterinarian said. Federal officials are monitoring closely and have advised veterinarians and producers to practice good biosecurity, test animals if they have to be moved, minimize animal movements and isolate sick cattle from the herd. The USDA, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating the illness among dairy cows, which is causing decreased milk production, low appetite and other symptoms. Federal officials are also working with state and local public health officials to monitor for signs of diseases among people at the facilities where bird flu was detected. Most infected animals have recovered after isolation, and few cattle deaths have been reported, the USDA said. Idaho's Leibsle said \"not all dairy producers will want to wait one, two, three weeks\" for dairy cows to recover. Some producers may decide to send the animals to slaughter as beef animals, he said. All those cattle will undergo the same rigorous food safety protocols. The USDA statement said there continues to be \"no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply because products are pasteurized before entering the market, or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health.\" Dairies are required to send milk only from healthy animals into processing for human consumption. Milk from infected animals is being diverted or destroyed so that it does not enter the human food supply, USDA said. In addition, pasteurization, which is required for milk entering interstate commerce for human consumption, inactivates bacteria and viruses, including influenza, in milk. Officials have long cautioned consumers to avoid raw or unpasteurized milk. FDA's long-standing position is that unpasteurized milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms posing serious health risks to consumers. Because of the limited information available about the transmission of HPAI in raw milk, the FDA recommends that the dairy industry not manufacture or sell raw milk or unpasteurized cheese products made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those infected with avian influenza or herds exposed to cows infected with the virus.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "Spread of symptoms among the Michigan herd also indicates that HPAI transmission between cattle cannot be ruled out."}]}

The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a news alert Monday that the patient became 'ill following contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected with avian influenza' and that their primary symptom was conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye. Officials said it is the first human case of the highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in Texas and the second in the U.S. They said it is 'believed to be associated with the recent detections of avian influenza A(H5N1) in dairy cows.' Bird flu risk to general public Federal and state health authorities are investigating the outbreak, the news alert said. It added that the risk to general public is low. 'Avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have only rarely been transmitted from person to person,' authorities said. 'As such, the risk to the general public is believed to be low; however, people with close contact with affected animals suspected of having avian influenza A(H5N1) have a higher risk of infection.' The state department of health, however, has warned health care providers to be vigilant about the sign and symptoms of bird flu, especially among people who have regular contact with animals. Bird flu in dairy cattle in Kansas, Texas The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that the highly contagious pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) had been found in unpasteurized clinical samples of milk from ill cows at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, plus a swab from a dairy cow in Texas. The agency said its officials, along with the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state veterinary and public health authorities, were investigating an illness detected primarily in older dairy cows in those states, as well as in New Mexico. Wild migratory birds are believed to be the source of the infection, the USDA had said. What is bird flu? Bird flu is a disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted among birds. Avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and the USDA, are classified into two groups: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI, often seen in wild birds) and HPAI, found mostly in domestic poultry. According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds. Bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds were slaughtered last year to limit the spread of the virus. Bird flu symptoms Signs and symptoms of bird flu, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, can include: * Fever (temperature of 100 degrees or greater), or feeling feverish or experiencing chills * Cough * Sore throat * Runny or stuffy nose * Headaches * Fatigue * Eye redness (conjunctivitis) * Difficulty breathing/shortness of breath * Diarrhea * Nausea * Vomiting * Seizures In some cases, infected patients may also experience conjunctivitis, or redness in the eyes, the department says. Those infected with avian influenza experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe, says the health department, explaining that reports of severe illness in humans 'have included fulminant pneumonia leading to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and (even) death.' Health care providers have been advised to immediately consult their local health department if they come across patients who are experiencing the symptoms and have come into close contact with livestock and cattle.

{"id": "415", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Bird flu is affecting a growing number of cattle herds in the US, and these infections have led to only the second known human case in the nation, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been no human-to-human spread in the US, but there have been sporadic cases of people sharing the bird flu virus in other parts of the world, so the CDC says it is watching the situation closely. Like all viruses, H5N1 has the potential to mutate to become more of a threat to humans. \"The risk overall for the general public remains low,\" Dr. Nirav D. Shah, the agency's principal deputy director, said Wednesday. \"But make no mistake, the CDC is activated as a result of these findings. We are taking this situation extremely, extremely seriously and are actively engaged in making sure that the public health response is robust.\" The risk is considered low, in part, because when humans have caught this version of the virus, it's typically those who have close contact with sick animals. The infections usually stop there. \"So it may go from a bird or a chicken to a human, and that human may indeed pass it on to a spouse, for example, but what we don't see thereafter is sustained transmission from human to human,\" Shah said. The latest case — in a person in Texas who had exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected — was mild, officials said, but humans can get severely ill and die from the disease. \"So even though we haven't seen sustained transmission, we take this seriously, and that's why the CDC has sprung into action,\" Shah said. Shah said the agency and its local public health partners have been watching out for anyone who may have interacted with these herds and may have bird flu symptoms. They are testing only people with potential symptoms because of a concern over false positives. About 15 people have been tested in this outbreak, the CDC says, and only one had the virus. The Texas patient's only symptom was red eyes, and the CDC notes that it is not one typically associated with this flu, which more often causes a cough, fever or shortness of breath. \"In this respect, we want to be testing more people rather than fewer people, so that's why we went ahead and greenlit the testing for anybody with symptoms who have been exposed,\" Shah said. Doctors treated the Texas patient with an antiviral medication commonly used for the more familiar flu virus, and the person went into isolation. If the virus does mutate and spread among humans, the CDC said, it is prepared and can use existing products to detect and protect against it. The strain that was recovered from the latest person who was sick is the same version as in the sick cows and as has been circulating in birds. \"We have not seen any changes to the genome that would suggest a reduced effectiveness of either vaccines, [the antiviral drug] Tamiflu or diagnostic tests,\" Shah said. Scientists discovered the first cows sick with the virus in two dairies in Texas in March, the first cows known to be infected with bird flu. More humans may have been exposed to the virus since the US Department of Agriculture said Monday that it had detected the flu in a herd of dairy cows in New Mexico and five additional dairy herds in Texas. This was the first time the virus had been found in cows in New Mexico. In total, seven herds have been affected by bird flu in Texas, two in Kansas, one in Michigan and one in New Mexico, the USDA said. It is also suspected in a herd in Idaho, but those test results are still being analyzed. Since the start of this outbreak of bird flu in January 2022, more than 82 million poultry in 48 states have been affected, according to the CDC. Cases were also detected in 9,253 wild birds, although the true number is probably much higher. The virus has shown up in relatively fewer mammals, although those numbers have also been growing. Baby goats, ducks, geese, deer, foxes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, pet cats and other animals have tested positive. Watching the virus jump to cows has been a concern, said Dr. Thomas Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"It is important whenever there's a change — and this is a change that cattle are infected for the first time that we know about, and this is only the second human case in the US that's been detected — every time there's such a change, we need to dig into that and make sure there's nothing more than just a single one-off case from industrial exposure,\" he said. Shah said people shouldn't be alarmed by the official name for the virus: highly pathogenic avian influenza. \"That name, in and of itself, may raise the blood pressure of many people who are reading or watching. The 'highly pathogenic' part of the name refers to its virulence and severity in birds, not humans,\" he said. \"Indeed, if you are a migratory bird, this virus is bad news.\" Ducks and geese can carry the virus without appearing sick, but poultry aren't always so lucky. Highly pathogenic avian influenza carries \"very high mortality rates\" among chickens and turkeys, and farmers are concerned because it has continued to spread despite their best efforts to contain it. Because the virus spreads easily and can kill birds quickly, farmers usually have to cull even uninfected birds to prevent a wider outbreak. On Tuesday, Michigan reported cases in a commercial poultry facility. On Wednesday, the nation's largest egg producer found bird flu in a Texas facility. Cal-Maine Foods said it will have to depopulate 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets at its Texas facility, according to state Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, who called it \"absolutely devastating news for Cal-Marine and the entire Panhandle region, which has already suffered so much already.\" People who work with sick birds have had to take precautions, Inglesby said, but everyone doesn't have to get rid of their bird feeders. Studies have shown that bird flu may spread to songbirds, but the ones that typically gather at feeders — such as cardinals, sparrows and blue birds — and those you may see on the street like pigeons and crows do not typically carry bird flu viruses that would be a threat to humans, according to the CDC. However, \"it's always a good idea to wash your hands when you're interacting with wild birds,\" Inglesby said. With cows, the recommendation is that they be put into a special pen for sick animals, and they typically recover in seven to 10 days. Based on current knowledge, ranchers do not have to kill sick cows, Shah said. None of the cows in the sick herds have died from the infection as of Wednesday, he said. The cows probably caught the virus when they encountered wild migratory birds; however, the USDA's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service said it couldn't rule out cow-to-cow transmission, based on the spread of the illness among a herd in Michigan. The virus didn't appear to have any kind of respiratory transmission but more likely spread through infected milk. \"That appears to be the leading theory at this point,\" Inglesby said. Although the virus can be found in high concentrations in milk from sick cows, it does not pose a threat to humans who drink milk or eat dairy products because most milk in the US is pasteurized and has to be so in order to be sold across state lines. The pasteurization process inactivates viruses before the product can go to market. The US Food and Drug Administration continues to remind people that raw milk can pose a serious health risk to those who drink it. \"Before the situation at hand, CDC and FDA's position was stay away from raw milk. Now what we've done is add an asterisk to that and said, 'and we really mean it,' \" Shah said. Typically, the US has higher production of milk in the spring, the USDA said, and the infections in cows shouldn't hurt the nation's food supply. The agency says the milk lost from symptomatic cattle to date is \"too limited\" to have a major impact and shouldn't impact the price of milk. The USDA and the CDC said they will continue working with the industry and with local public health departments to monitor the situation and to encourage vets and farmers to report sick animals quickly so the impact of the virus can be limited.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_3", "statement": "It is important whenever there's a change — and this is a change that cattle are infected for the first time that we know about, and this is only the second human case in the US that's been detected — every time there's such a change, we need to dig into that and make sure there's nothing more than just a single one-off case from industrial exposure."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_4", "statement": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza carries 'very high mortality rates' among chickens and turkeys, and farmers are concerned because it has continued to spread despite their best efforts to contain it."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_5", "statement": "The USDA's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service said it couldn't rule out cow-to-cow transmission, based on the spread of the illness among a herd in Michigan."}]}
{"id": "416", "fulltext": "The discovery of H5N1 bird flu in U.S. cattle and the news that at least one person in Texas has been infected, apparently through contact with infected cows, has taken scientists who study influenza by surprise. But after absorbing their shock, several admitted there was evidence to suggest bovine infection could happen; it just hadn’t been reported with this particular strain of influenza virus until now. The person had contact with dairy cattle that are believed to have been infected with the virus, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement. It went on to say that the individual’s only symptom is eye inflammation infection of the conjunctiva, the tissue surrounding the eye. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the infected individual is doing well and is being treated with the influenza antiviral oseltamivir, sold as Tamiflu. The individual was instructed to isolate to reduce the risk of infecting others, and to date there’s no indication of onward spread, Shah said. Related: Tracking the bird flu, experts see a familiar threat and a virus whose course is hard to predict. “We are not aware of reports that any of this individual’s close contacts have developed any symptoms,” he told STAT. The person was tested late last week, with confirmatory testing taking place at the CDC over the weekend. The CDC is not currently running any other confirmatory H5 tests, Shah said. “The fact that there are not other samples cooking right now is reassuring, insofar as that we’re not aware of other individuals who are symptomatic following an exposure to livestock,” he added. “We are still out there looking, to be very clear,” he said. “Our antennae are up and we have been working with state public health officials in a number of jurisdictions to look for individuals who report signs and symptoms of illness, to make sure they know how to get tested.” NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy Three states Texas, Kansas, and Michigan have recently reported they have had confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in cattle; New Mexico and Idaho have also reported outbreaks in cattle that are presumed to have been caused by H5N1. The virus doesn’t kill the cattle, but milk production is lowered and the animals’ feeding is reduced. Owners of implicated herds have been told to destroy milk produced by infected cattle, though if milk from infected animals made its way into the food chain, pasteurization could kill the virus, the CDC statement said. Up until now, cows have not been on the ever-lengthening list of animals that have been known to be susceptible to this virus. Infections of the highly pathogenic bird flu, a term that describes how it behaves in poultry, have been detected in many other mammals, though, including big cats, bears, foxes, skunks, sea lions, and seals. Despite the alarming increase in the past few years of the virus’s geographic range and the number of species it has been seen to infect, both the World Health Organization and the CDC currently assess its risk to people as low. The news of the case in Texas does not change that, Shah said. Trending Now: This AI company scans penis pictures for STIs. Its unproven tech is in an FDA gray zone. H5N1 bird flu has been high on the worry list of experts on emerging diseases for the past two decades. Over that time there have been nearly 900 human infections in 23 countries; just over half of those infections have been fatal. But in recent years the strain of the virus circulating in many parts of the world, including the United States, seems to trigger human infections less frequently than earlier versions of the virus did. And when human cases caused by this strain occur, they are typically mild. A case in point was the country’s first H5 infection, which occurred in 2022. A man who was involved in culling infected poultry in Colorado reported feeling fatigued; he tested positive for the virus. It was unclear if he was actually even infected or simply had viruses in his nose that were picked up by a nasal swab test. The low rate of human infections and the mildness of most cases when they occur has counterbalanced concern about the virus’s astonishing spread. But people who have studied influenza and this virus in particular for years do not know what to make of its movement into so many different animal species. Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., called the infections in cows “a head scratcher,” saying he would not have figured cattle to be on the list of animals susceptible to this virus. “This particular version of H5 is teaching us a number of things we thought we knew weren’t right,” Webby said. He termed the news of the Texas case “not unexpected, but always a concern.” Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, said the move into cows expands the virus’ range, “but I’m not sure what it portends for humans and swine.” Osterholm said he would be more concerned if there were word that the virus had been found to be infecting pigs. Pigs can be infected with human and avian flu viruses and co-infection of more than one type of virus in pigs can produce reassortants hybrid viruses that might be more able to infect people. As of now, he believes the risk H5N1 poses is not changed by the infection of cattle. “This all could change in a heartbeat with additional mutations. But there’s no evidence this virus has changed,” Osterholm said.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_5", "statement": "But there’s no evidence this virus has changed."}]}
{"id": "421", "fulltext": "After a dairy worker in Texas was infected with a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, disease trackers worry the recent outbreak among cattle could develop into a larger threat. The risk to the general public remains low, but experts are concerned about the possibility of the H5N1 virus evolving and more easily spreading from birds to other mammals. Here's what to know about bird flu, its symptoms and treatment, and its risk to humans and pets. What is bird flu? Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in more than 9,000 wild birds and has affected more than 82 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since early 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm. Can humans catch bird flu? It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds - whether the birds are dead or alive - or with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces. Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks - probably from eating infected wild birds - experts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. Two human cases have been reported in the United States, including the case in Texas, which the CDC announced Monday. The first case was in 2022, when a person in Colorado with direct exposure to poultry tested positive for the same strain. Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis - an eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes - to more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said. The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain. A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus - by sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example - to develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia, he said, and then the fatality rate is very high. What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans? Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms - fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing. The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the past 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said. Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat. How is it treated? People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said. Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans? Yes, there are vaccines for the bird flu. But they would need to be tested to determine whether they are a match for this specific strain. Vaccine manufacturing would then need to be scaled up and mass-produced. Can bird flu kill humans? Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare. According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and February 2024, 887 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 were reported globally from 23 countries. Of those who were infected, there were 462 deaths. While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Could bird flu become the next pandemic? Each time there is highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person. That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people. Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchange of genetic material is a random event. If anything, the odds are against it, Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although the strain has infected some mammals - including mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm in October 2022 - that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans, he said. Can dogs and cats catch bird flu? Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said. Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons. If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection, Cardona said. Is there an impact to the nation's dairy supply? Federal agencies are reassuring the public about the nation's dairy supply after the bird flu was recently found in dairy cows. Since milk products are pasteurized, there continues to be no concern about the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply, the Food and Drug Administration said in a notice on its website. Only milk from healthy animals is authorized to be distributed into interstate commerce for humans to consume, the agency said, adding that pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza. That means there hasn't been much impact on the country's supply of milk or the cost of dairy products. Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs? No. Humans cannot become infected by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs. However, according to the CDC, uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia. The CDC advises that it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States. Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry - and other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry - are typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products, she said. They don't even make it into your pet food. What about my backyard chickens? People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said. Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease. Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying. People who have backyard chickens should take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said. Does risk vary by state or country? Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds, and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable, Iqbal said. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world. Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu? China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality. But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks. Britain, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly. In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds that may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed. Should you worry birds in your area are spreading avian flu? Wild birds - such as ducks, geese and swans - are most likely to be infected with this strain of bird flu, according to the CDC. It can easily be spread to poultry, like chickens and turkey. However, the most common songbirds or other birds found in backyards - like cardinals, robins and pigeons - don't usually carry bird flu viruses dangerous to poultry or humans. Generally, people should avoid direct contact with wild birds, the CDC states. What precautions are federal and state health officials recommending? Federal and state health officials are recommending that people avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals, including cattle, as well as animal carcasses, raw milk, feces, litter or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection. People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or food products, including unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheeses, from animals with confirmed or suspected bird flu. CDC is recommending that farmers and owners of poultry, backyard flock and livestock wear personal protective equipment, such as N95 masks, eye protection and gloves, as well as wash their hands thoroughly when in direct contact - or entering any buildings - with sick or dead birds or other animals, carcasses, or feces or litter of potentially infected animals. People exposed to birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection should be monitored for symptoms of illness for 10 days after the last known exposure, even if they were wearing recommended personal protective equipment. http://www.washingtonpost.com WP20240403faq-birdflu", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_2", "statement": "Experts are concerned about the possibility of the H5N1 virus evolving and more easily spreading from birds to other mammals."}]}
{"id": "423", "fulltext": "The largest egg producer in the United States said Tuesday that it temporarily ceased operations at one of its Texas facilities after detecting bird flu in chickens—the latest in a steady uptick of cases among U.S. farm animals in recent weeks. Cal-Maine Foods said it culled about 1.6 million hens and 337,000 pullets (young hens) after some of its chickens at a Parmer County, Texas, facility tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild and domestic birds. A dairy worker in Texas was being treated for the virus that causes avian influenza, becoming only the second known human case in the United States, state and federal officials said Monday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the person tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The culled chickens at Cal-Maine Foods represent 3.6 percent of its flock as of March 2, it said. The company said no farm is immune from HPAI but added that it remains dedicated to robust biosecurity programs across its locations. Minnesota officials reported the first infection of bird flu among livestock in the United States last month, when a juvenile goat living on a farm with infected chickens tested positive. Last month, bird flu was also detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas. Later that week, U.S. officials said that cows in Michigan had tested positive and that there were presumptive positive tests among cows in Idaho and New Mexico, suggesting that the virus may be spreading among cattle. On Tuesday, Michigan's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced that bird flu was detected at a commercial poultry plant in Ionia County, the fourth detection of HPAI in a commercial facility since the virus was first spotted in the state in 2022. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also said Tuesday that cases were detected in a dairy cow herd in Idaho. Officials have said the risk to human health remains low. But the CDC has warned that people with unprotected exposure to infected birds or other animals, including livestock, are at greater risk of infection. People should also avoid uncooked or undercooked food, unpasteurized milk and raw cheese, according to the CDC. Cooking eggs or poultry to an internal temperature of about 165 degrees Fahrenheit generally kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses, it says. Backyard chickens or pet chickens are at risk if they come in contact with wild birds carrying the virus. Human symptoms of bird flu include eye redness, fever, coughing, sore throat, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or seizures are less common, the CDC said.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "The CDC has warned that people with unprotected exposure to infected birds or other animals, including livestock, are at greater risk of infection."}]}
{"id": "431", "fulltext": "I have tracked deadly, massive outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry for the past two decades. Hundreds of millions of birds have died, and there has been frequent spillover to other species, including mink, seals, foxes, skunks and even dogs and cats. This week, the nation's largest supplier of eggs stopped production after birds at a plant in Texas tested positive. About 2 million chickens were slaughtered to prevent spread of the illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that a person in Texas had contracted the flu but is displaying only mild symptoms. The public has worried at times about a massive human pandemic, but since 2005, the structure of the bird flu virus has not changed significantly. That is extremely good news, especially when you consider that gain-of-function research conducted in Dr. Ron Fouchier's lab in the Netherlands in 2011 revealed the mutations needed for bird flu to pass from human to human. Monitoring of the virus in nature has shown that those mutations have yet to occur. I spoke this week with CDC Director Mandy Cohen, who told me that the current spillover of bird flu to cattle has not shown any significant genetic changes. That is also good news. The outbreak has occurred only in a few states (Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas), but cattle are brought from state to state and could have picked up the virus from birds. Dr. Cohen told me that the cattle have shown mild upper respiratory symptoms. Can you import prescriptions? Florida can now import prescription drugs from Canada. It's great news to my patients. Person with bird flu experienced mild symptoms The patient in Texas also had mild symptoms—conjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms. She said the man was treated with Tamiflu and quickly got better. People in close contact with him also were given Tamiflu, as a precaution against further spread. Click to view image. Dr. Cohen said there is potential for cattle to become the first mammals to become a reservoir of the bird flu. The CDC is working closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track cattle that have or have been exposed to the illness to determine if there is any sustained spread. Over the past two decades, more than 400 million birds either have died from the disease or been culled to prevent transmission. Yet, human cases remain rare, with only 2,634 cases and about 1,000 deaths. Bird flu pandemic? Experts look at worst-case scenarios. Don't get me wrong: It is the potential for the virus to adapt to human transmission over time that keeps many scientists and public health specialists up at night. But far too often, those experts are looking at worst-case scenarios to the detriment of public perception. Fear is at the heart of public and media reactions to the potential of bird flu and other viruses to become a much-deadlier threat to humans. Your doctor might not listen to you. AI can help change that. David Nabarro, a senior World Health Organizations expert on infectious diseases, warned the public in 2005 that up to 150 million people could die of bird flu. And though his prediction was far from reality, it was taken seriously at the time. Since then, there have been intermittent flare-ups of public fears, stoked by the idea that bird flu will become the WHO's so-called Disease X, a virus with a high death rate that spreads easily and quickly.

That is not only reassuring now but also is likely to continue to be the case. The greater danger remains the fear of the virus rather than the virus itself. But there is one major caveat. The road map, developed by Dr. Fouchier, for a mutation deadly to humans could end up in the wrong hands. And that risk is enough to keep everyone up at night. Click to view image.

The outbreak has occurred only in a few states (Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas), but cattle are brought from state to state and could have picked up the virus from birds. Dr. Cohen told me that the cattle have shown mild upper respiratory symptoms. The person with bird flu had mild symptoms: conjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms. She said the man was treated with Tamiflu and quickly got better. People in close contact with him also were given Tamiflu, as a precaution against further spread. Dr. Cohen said there is potential for cattle to become the first mammals to become a reservoir of the bird flu. The CDC is working closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track cattle that have or have been exposed to the illness to determine if there is any sustained spread. Over the past two decades, more than 400 million birds either have died from the disease or been culled to prevent transmission. Yet, human cases remain rare, with only 2,634 cases and about 1,000 deaths. Worst-case scenarios don't get me wrong: It is the potential for the virus to adapt to human transmission over time that keeps many scientists and public health specialists up at night. But far too often, those experts are looking at worst-case scenarios to the detriment of public perception. Fear is at the heart of public and media reactions to the potential of bird flu and other viruses to become a much-deadlier threat to humans. David Nabarro, a senior World Health Organization expert on infectious diseases, warned the public in 2005 that up to 150 million people could die of bird flu. And though his prediction was far from reality, it was taken seriously. Since then, there have been intermittent flare-ups of public fears, stoked by the idea that bird flu will become the WHO's so-called Disease X, a virus with a high death rate that spreads quickly. But the species barrier that protects us from bird flu is still in place, and the risk to the public remains extremely low, according to the CDC director. That is not only reassuring now but also is likely to continue to be the case. The greater danger remains the fear of the virus rather than the virus itself. But there is one major caveat. The road map, developed by Dr. Fouchier, for a mutation deadly to humans could end up in the wrong hands. And that risk is enough to keep everyone up at night.

{"id": "442", "fulltext": "A bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows has grown to affect more than two dozen herds in eight states, just weeks after the nation's largest egg producer found the virus in its chickens. Health officials stress that the risk to the public is low and that the U.S. food supply remains safe and stable. 'At this time, there continues to be no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, or that it affects the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,' the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement. Here's what you need to know about bird flu and food: WHICH STATES HAVE FOUND BIRD FLU IN DAIRY COWS? As of Friday, the strain of bird flu that has killed millions of wild birds in recent years has been found in at least 26 dairy herds in eight U.S. states: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and South Dakota. The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in a range of mammals over the last few years, but this is the first time it has been found in cattle, according to federal health and animal agencies. Genetic analysis of the virus does not show that it has changed to spread more easily in people, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. HOW IS BIRD FLU AFFECTING FOOD PRODUCTION? Agriculture officials in at least 17 states have restricted imports of dairy cattle from states where the virus has been detected, but, so far, government agencies say it's had little effect on commercial milk production. Officials believe cows likely have been infected by exposure to wild birds, but said cow-to-cow spread 'cannot be ruled out.' Farmers are testing cows that show symptoms of infection, including sharply reduced milk supply and lethargy. Animals that show signs or test positive for illness are being separated from other animals on the farms. The animals appear to recover within two weeks. U.S. egg producers are watching the situation closely after bird flu was detected in chickens in Texas and Michigan. Millions of birds have been killed, but the FDA said the risk of affected eggs getting into the retail market or causing infections in humans is low because of federal inspections and other safeguards. DOES PASTEURIZATION KILL BIRD FLU? Scientists say there's no evidence to suggest that people can contract the virus by consuming food that's been pasteurized, or heat-treated or properly cooked. 'It's not a food safety concern,' said Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University. Two people in U.S. have been infected with bird flu to date. A Texas dairy worker who was in close contact with an infected cow recently developed a mild eye infection and has recovered. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a Colorado poultry farm. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. IS GROCERY STORE MILK SAFE FROM BIRD FLU? Yes, according to food safety experts and government officials. U.S. producers are barred from selling milk from sick cows and must divert and destroy it. In addition, milk sold across state lines is required to be pasteurized, or heat-treated using a process that kills bacteria and viruses, including influenza. 'We firmly believe that pasteurization provides a safe milk supply,' Tracey Forfa, director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine told a webinar audience this week. IS RAW MILK SAFE FROM BIRD FLU? The FDA and the CDC are less certain about unpasteurized, or raw, milk sold in many states, saying there's limited information about the possible transmission of the H5N1 virus in such products. So far, no herds linked to raw milk providers have reported cows infected with bird flu, but the agencies recommend that the industry not make or sell raw milk or raw milk cheese products made with milk from cows that show symptoms or are exposed to infected cows. U.S. health officials have long warned against the risk of foodborne illness tied to raw milk, which the CDC said caused more than 200 outbreaks that sickened more than 2,600 people between 1998 and 2018. Still, raw milk proponents like Mark McAfee, owner of Raw Farm USA in Fresno, Calif., said the outbreak of H5N1 in commercial cows appears to have spurred higher sales of the products, despite federal warnings. CAN YOU CATCH BIRD FLU FROM EGGS OR MEAT? Only dairy cows, not beef cattle, have been infected or shown signs of illness to date, agriculture officials said. The largest egg producer in the U.S. temporarily halted operations on April 2 after finding bird flu in its chickens. Cal-Maine Foods culled about 1.6 million laying hens and another 337,000 pullets, or young hens, after the detection. The company said there was no risk to eggs in the market and that no eggs had been recalled. Eggs that are handled properly and cooked thoroughly are safe to eat, said Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University. 'A lot of people like runny eggs. Personally, if I eat an egg, it's very well cooked,' she said. Still, Kowalcyk and others cautioned that the situation could change. 'This is an emerging issue and clearly this pathogen is evolving and there's a lot that we don't know,' she said. 'I do think that everybody is trying to figure it out as quickly as possible.' ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

{"id": "450", "fulltext": "Officials have shared little information, saying the outbreak was limited. But asymptomatic cows in North Carolina have changed the assessment. In the month since federal authorities announced an outbreak of bird flu on dairy farms, they have repeatedly reassured the public that the spate of infections does not impact the nation's food or milk supply, and poses little risk to the public. Yet the outbreak among cows may be more serious than originally believed. In an obscure online update this week, the Department of Agriculture said there is now evidence that the virus is spreading among cows, and from cows to poultry. Officials in North Carolina have detected bird flu infections in a cattle herd with no symptoms, The New York Times has learned—information the U.S.D.A. has not shared publicly. The finding suggests that the infections may be more widespread than thought. Whether there are asymptomatic animals elsewhere remains unclear, because the U.S.D.A. is not requiring farms to test cattle for infection. It has been reimbursing farmers for testing, but only for 20 cows per farm that were visibly ill. This week, the department said it would begin reimbursing farms for testing cows without symptoms. Federal officials have shared limited genetic information about the virus with scientists and with officials in other countries, which is important for learning how the virus might be evolving as it spreads. They are not actively monitoring infections in pigs, which are famously effective hosts for evolving flu viruses, and which are often kept in proximity to cattle. And officials have said they have 'no concern' about the safety of milk, despite a lack of hard data. In joint statements in March, the U.S.D.A., the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assured the public that pasteurized milk was safe. But the F.D.A. is still conducting tests to ascertain whether the process eliminates the virus. The agency declined to say when results from those tests would be available. Some experts said the agencies should not have asserted that the milk is safe before they had the data in hand, even though there is only a slim chance of risk to people. 'I understand that the milk market is very concerned about a loss of even a few percent of milk consumption,' said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota. But, he added, 'The idea that you can avoid this kind of discussion by just giving absolutes is not going to serve them well.' The federal response so far echoes early missteps during the pandemic, he and other experts said. 'It seems they learned little from the communication lessons that Covid taught us,' Dr. Osterholm said. In an interview this week, Dr. Rosemary Sifford, the U.S.D.A.'s chief veterinarian, said that more than a dozen federal epidemiologists, roughly twice as many laboratory employees, field staff members and academic and state collaborators were all involved in the investigations. 'Please recall that we've been engaged in this for less than a month,' she said. 'We are working very hard to generate more information.' U.S.D.A. staff are analyzing only viral genetic sequences from sick cows, but will release information for outside experts 'in the very, very near future,' Dr. Sifford said. 'We definitely recognize that we need to learn more about the overall picture,' she added. If the department were more forthcoming, scientists outside the government could already be helping to contain the virus, Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, said. 'The days when it was seen as a good plan or acceptable for a government agency to keep all data to manage on its own are gone long ago,' he said. Part of the problem, some experts said, is that the U.S.D.A. has long been in the position of both regulating and promoting the business of agriculture. 'We all want farms to succeed, and we want to have that steady food supply for the American consumer,' said Donn Teske, president of the Kansas Farmers Union. 'But then when you are also tasked with the oversight, it's a little bit of an issue there.' The current version of the bird flu virus has been circulating since 2020 in poultry, wild birds and more recently, a wide range of mammals. As of Friday afternoon, the outbreak in dairy cows had spread to 32 herds in eight states: Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina and South Dakota. It is unclear how the outbreak began on dairy farms. Early data suggest that there were at least two spillovers of the virus from bird to cow, in the Texas Panhandle and New Mexico, Dr. Sifford said. So far among cattle, the virus, called H5N1, seems only to affect lactating cows, and only temporarily. There have been no diagnoses in calves, pregnant heifers or beef cows, and no deaths. But the virus appears to have spilled back, from cows to poultry, in at least one instance in Texas. That infected herd and poultry flock were on different farms. But the virus may have been transported between them by people or animals that had contact with objects contaminated with virus-laden milk, according to the Texas Animal Health Commission. Infected cows appear to carry large amounts of the virus in their milk. (The U.S.D.A. has tested relatively few animals by nasal swab, however, and is not testing feces, a common repository for viruses.) Milking equipment on dairy farms is typically deep-cleaned, but not sterilized, at least once a day. People milking cows are encouraged to wear safety glasses, or masks or face shields, but the recommendations are often ignored. In cows sickened by H5N1, milk production drops sharply, and the milk becomes viscous and yellowish. 'We've never seen something like this before,' said Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. (Milk from infected but asymptomatic cows seems unchanged, according to a spokeswoman for the North Carolina agriculture department.) In interviews, some experts criticized the U.S.D.A.'s testing recommendations, which until this week promised reimbursement only for a pool of animals that were obviously ill. Farmers may not have found many infections simply because they were not looking for them. Widespread testing of animals with and without symptoms is crucial early in outbreaks to understand the scale and the possible mechanisms of viral transmission, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Pigs are a linchpin in flu surveillance, many experts noted, as they are susceptible to both bird and human flu. They might act as 'mixing bowls,' enabling H5N1 to acquire the ability to spread efficiently among people. The U.S.D.A. is not testing pigs or asking farmers to do so, Dr. Sifford said. Testing cows for H5N1 infection requires approval from a state official. Milk samples obtained by an accredited veterinarian are typically packaged in tubes, packed in insulated coolers, and shipped to a U.S.D.A.-approved lab, along with a unique identifier. Positive tests are then confirmed by the U.S.D.A.'s national lab in Iowa. Each step slows the speedy response needed to contain an outbreak, Dr. Inglesby said. Testing should be easy, free and accessible, he said. Dr. Sifford said the U.S.D.A. has already received a 'small number' of samples from cows without symptoms. The department is 'strongly recommending testing before herds are moved between states, which includes asymptomatic herds,' an agency statement said. Already some state health departments and farmers have grown frustrated with the federal approach. Several farms in Minnesota—not one of the eight states with known cases—are sending samples of cow blood to private labs to test for antibodies to the virus, which would indicate a current or past infection, said Dr. Joe Armstrong, a veterinarian at the University of Minnesota Extension. Other dairy farmers are reluctant to test, worried that fears about bird flu could hurt their business, said Dr. Amy Swinford, director of the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. 'I think there's many more dairies that have had this going on than what we've gotten samples from,' she said. Dairy farmers are grappling with low milk prices and high feed costs, said Rick Naerebout, chief executive of the Idaho Dairymen's Association. 'It's already a very difficult economic situation, and then to look at possibly losing 20 percent of your revenue for a period of two to four weeks—that's really adding a lot of anxiousness to the situation,' he said. Idaho barred the importation of cows from the Texas Panhandle after news of bird flu outbreak there, but a week too late. Having an infected herd in Idaho despite those precautions 'was kind of a gut shot,' Mr. Naerebout said. Matt Herrick, a spokesman for the International Dairy Foods Association, said that federal officials should provide more resources and equipment for farmers to protect themselves, and should publicize updates more widely, including through social media. There is no mention of the bird flu outbreak on the U.S.D.A.'s homepage. The last outbreak-related announcement from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a division of the department, is dated April 2. The U.S.D.A. is exploring vaccines to protect cattle from H5N1, but it is unclear how long it might take to develop them. Dr. Armstrong, of the University of Minnesota Extension, said many farmers and veterinarians hope the virus will 'burn itself out.' Instead, it may become a long-term problem. 'The goal is to prepare for that,' he said. 'Not for this wishful thinking of, 'It'll just go away.''", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_4", "statement": "The virus may have been transported between them by people or animals that had contact with objects contaminated with virus-laden milk, according to the Texas Animal Health Commission."}]}
{"id": "453", "fulltext": "World Health Organization's top scientist said this week the recent bird flu outbreak is of 'great concern' to public health, and vaccine development to halt the virus is 'not where we need to be.' The virus, known as Type A H5N1, which typically circulates among poultry and wild birds, has spread to mammals, including cows, cats and at least two people in the U.S. in recent years. The new development experts are eyeing is that the virus is now passing from mammal to mammal. Bird flu has a high mortality rate in the hundreds of people who've contracted it, Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at WHO, the United Nations health agency, told reporters on Thursday. Dairy cows, worker: Bird flu outbreak is an 'evolving situation.' Here's what to know about symptoms, spread. U.S. health officials say the country is ready to ramp up vaccine production if the risk of bird flu rises. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health remains low. 'It's too early to press the panic button,' Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University and a leading expert in global health, told USA TODAY. The nightmare scenario, he explained, is if the virus makes a genetic leap and begins human-to-human transmission. This would be worse than the COVID-19 pandemic given how infectious and deadly the virus is, he said. While no human-to-human transmission has occurred, Farrar, of WHO, expressed concern about recent U.S. cases showing bird flu cases among cattle in several states and a Texas dairy worker. The infection has started to become a pandemic among animal species, he said at a news conference. 'The great concern, of course, is that in doing so and infecting ducks and chickens, but now increasingly mammals that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans,' he said. 'And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission.' Farrar also flagged his concern that vaccine development is not 'where we need to be' and public health officials don't currently have the capability to diagnose H5N1. In a statement to USA TODAY, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response said its National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) program is equipped to respond rapidly to influenza strains as they evolve. 'NPIVS works closely with industry partners to make and test updated vaccines that match new strains of influenza viruses with pandemic potential as they emerge, while at the same time, supporting manufacturing capacity to allow for large-scale vaccine production if needed,' the statement said. There are two antigens that are 'well-matched' to the circulating strain of H5N1, the federal agency said. The agency said hundreds of thousands of doses of vaccine could be deployed within weeks, pending regulatory action by the Food and Drug Administration. Within months, federal officials could deploy more than 100 million doses. But Gostin, of Georgetown, said he doubts that's realistic. While the U.S. is comparatively better, the world lacks the capacity to ramp up hundreds of millions or billions of vaccines for a pandemic with bird flu. And even if the vaccine initially matches virus strains, the virus mutates quickly. He also noted that public health systems lack the ability for early detection and testing of bird flu. 'For many, many decades, these avian and swine influenzas have stayed within the animal kingdom,' Gostin said. 'The hope and the expectation is that it will continue to do that. But one day, that virus will mutate and go to a human, and then spread to a global pandemic very, very quickly. And we have to be ready for that day.' Bird flu in dairy cows in eight states, recent human case Eight states experienced recent bird flu outbreaks in dairy cows beginning in late March in Texas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture believes migratory birds were the source of the infection in cows. The virus then spread from herd to herd, experts believe, suggesting there has been transmission among mammals. Genomic sequencing of the viruses taken from infected cattle indicates this virus is not more transmissible to humans, the USDA said. On April 1, Texas health officials said a dairy worker was infected with bird flu after close contact with sick cows. The worker—the second person in the U.S. to get bird flu since 2022—had symptoms of conjunctivitis or eye redness. Bird flu spreads primarily through contact with infected birds, including sick or dead animals. Human cases are rare. Most occur in people who've had unprotected exposure to sick animals. The risk is heightened for people who work with infected poultry or livestock, and for veterinarians who treat infected animals. On Thursday, the WHO said it also updated its terms on airborne diseases for the next expected pandemic. Consulting with health agencies in the U.S., Africa, China and Europe, health officials are opting for 'infectious respiratory particles' instead of 'aerosols' or 'droplets' to avoid confusion about particle sizes, the U.N. said. This can better coordinate responses to respiratory pathogens, Farrar, of WHO, said. Karen Weintraub contributed to this report. The U.S. has seen dairy cows infected with bird flu across eight states, as one Texas dairy worker working among infected cattle also became sick.

{"id": "461", "fulltext": "The H5N1 bird flu outbreak in dairy cows in the United States has likely been going on for months longer than was previously realized, and has probably spread more widely across the country than the confirmed outbreaks would imply, according to an analysis of genetic sequences that were released Sunday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The genetic data point to a single spillover event that probably occurred in late 2023, Michael Worobey, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Arizona, told STAT on Tuesday. \"The bad news is it looks like this is well entrenched and has been in cattle for a long time and ... probably very, very, very widespread,\" said Worobey, who worked on the analysis with a number of scientists in the U.S. and Europe. He suggested the outbreak needs to be taken more seriously than it has been until now, especially given the amount of exposure humans have with cattle. \"We need to just study the hell out of it for starters ... and see if we can close the gap on what is happening and what we know.\" NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy Though there were reports of a mysterious illness affecting dairy cows in Texas as early as February, the USDA first confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 in dairy cows in that state in late March. Since then, the number of confirmed outbreaks has climbed to 33 herds in eight states. One person a farm worker who developed conjunctivitis has been confirmed to have been infected. The USDA has been unclear about whether these outbreaks are all linked the result of the movement of cattle, farm equipment, or workers or whether there have been multiple spillover events where infected wild birds have transmitted the virus to cows. Last week, it told STAT it could find links between the infected herds in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico; it is also known that cows in the first infected Michigan herd detected had been brought in from Texas. But USDA hasn't been able to draw a line between those outbreaks and others in Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Dakota. The genetic sequences cluster too closely for this to be anything other than a single spillover, Worobey said. \"If it were jumping from bird to cattle over and over again ... I wouldn't think you would just get this same very reduced genetic diversity where each of the internal segments are showing the same pattern.\" Related: H5N1 bird flu virus particles found in pasteurized milk but FDA says commercial milk supply appears safe The prospect of an outbreak that has been underway for months longer than had been previously known is not reassuring to those who follow the dangerous H5N1 virus. \"If that's true, it's been flying under the radar for a really embarrassingly, frustratingly long time,\" Worobey said. \"And we have no idea how much it's spreading asymptomatically and how widespread it is. And we're trying to deal with something long after the horse has bolted.\" Tom Peacock, an influenza virologist at the Pirbright Institute, a British organization that focuses on controlling viral illnesses in animals, concurred with Worobey's read of the data. Related: USDA releases H5N1 bird flu genetic data eagerly awaited by scientists The USDA has previously reported that it believed that virus from an infected cattle herd had found its way into a nearby chicken operation in Michigan. The genetic sequences for cows, poultry, and other infected species that were released by the USDA suggest that hypothesis is correct, Peacock said. \"If you look at all the cattle sequences together, they all cluster, as do the cats and the chickens and the grackles and stuff.\" \"The thing that doesn't fit that picture is the human case,\" he said. The genetic sequence from the human case, which occurred on an unidentified farm in Texas, is sufficiently different from the cattle sequences that it can't be easily linked to them, he said. The differences suggest that the individual was either infected in a separate event maybe not via a cow, but through contact with infected wild birds or that there might have been another line of viruses in cattle early on and it has since died out. \"It's basically too distant a cousin to be connected directly to this outbreak, which either means it's a second spillover or there was an early bifurcation of the cattle sequences,\" Peacock said. The 239 genetic sequences the USDA shared on Sunday did not include what's known as metadata information on where the sample that generated the sequence was taken, what part of the body of the infected animal it was taken from, or when precisely the collection occurred. They simply state \"USA\" and \"2024,\" which limits how well outside scientists can interpret what they are seeing. Peacock said it would have been helpful to know whether any of the cattle sequences had been generated from samples taken on the farm where the infected worker was thought to have been exposed to the virus. But that information is not available. Asked whether the analysis of the genetic data increases his sense of the risk H5N1 poses to humans, Worobey suggested he was uncomfortable with the knowledge that H5N1 seems to be spreading in mammals, calling that unprecedented. Having the virus in a mammalian species with which people have frequent contact gives H5N1 more opportunities to acquire the mutations needed to be able to evolve to be able to infect people, or \"more shots on goal,\" Worobey said. \"That's bad.\"", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_2", "statement": "Having the virus in a mammalian species with which people have frequent contact gives H5N1 more opportunities to acquire the mutations needed to be able to evolve to be able to infect people, or 'more shots on goal,' Worobey said."}]}
{"id": "471", "fulltext": "Since a new form of bird flu arrived in 2022, federal officials have sought to reassure Americans that the threat to the public remained low. The Biden administration on Wednesday said that it would begin requiring dairy cows moving across state lines to be tested for bird flu, which has been spreading in herds for months. The new policy is part of a growing effort to stamp out the spread of a virus that federal health officials have sought to reassure Americans poses little risk to people so far. The new order, issued by the Department of Agriculture, says that lactating cows must test negative for influenza A viruses, a class that includes bird flu, before they are transported. The owners of herds with positive tests will need to provide data on the movements of the cattle to help investigators trace the disease. The testing will help protect the livestock industry, limit the spread of the virus and better understand this disease, Mike Watson, a senior Department of Agriculture official, told reporters in a press briefing Wednesday morning. Since a highly contagious form of bird flu was detected in the United States in 2022, federal officials have sought to reassure Americans that the threat to the public remained low, even as the virus infected a growing number of mammals. Federal regulators on Tuesday announced that inactive viral fragments had been found in pasteurized milk, a suggestion that the virus was likely spreading much more widely among cattle than previously known. Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on Wednesday that there were no changes in the genetic makeup of the virus that would allow it to spread easily among people. So far, Dr. Shah said, states have been monitoring 44 people who were exposed to the virus and are being monitored for infection. As of Wednesday, the outbreak had spread to 33 herds in eight states, according to the U.S.D.A. But just one human infection has been reported, in a dairy worker in Texas who had direct contact with sick cows. The case was mild. Federal officials on Wednesday also sought to downplay the severity of the findings of the Food and Drug Administration in recent days that inactive viral fragments had been found in pasteurized milk, including some from grocery shelves. Don Prater, an F.D.A. official, told reporters on Wednesday that regulators were conducting more advanced tests to determine whether any milk contained live virus. The agency would publish data in the coming days on the milk tests, he said. The U.S.D.A. order will require laboratories and state veterinarians to report any positive tests from cattle to the agency. Mr. Watson said that the department would be able to process tens of thousands of tests each day, with results reported after one to three days. The agency will now reimburse dairies for testing cows without symptoms as well as those being moved. Dr. Shah, the C.D.C. official, said that the federal government was relying on local officials and health workers to communicate with dairy producers and their workers, including veterinarians who have close relationships with people who might be hesitant to open up to strangers. There may be owners that are reluctant to work with public health, to say nothing of individual workers who may be reluctant to sit down with somebody who identifies themselves as being from the government in some way, Dr. Shah said. It is still not clear when the bird flu outbreak began, but an analysis of genetic data suggests that wild birds might have passed the pathogen to cows as early as December. Cows were not typically thought to be susceptible to bird flu, and it was not until late March that federal officials announced that the virus had been detected in sick cows in Texas and Kansas. The U.S.D.A. order came after public health experts and dairy producers had criticized the Biden administration for the scope of its investigation into the cow outbreak and the lack of widespread testing. While testing more cows is critical, so is reducing the risk of infection among dairy workers regularly exposed to fresh milk now thought to contain extensive virus, said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University. If a worker were to get splashed in the nose or eyes and become infected, that human infection would give the virus new opportunities to adapt and start spreading among people, she said. Federal health officials said on Wednesday that they had reminded states that they could request protective equipment from the national stockpile. But Dr. Lakdawala said the risks of worker infections were already serious enough that farms should universally implement the use of face shields. She said other steps, like a two-week stay-at-home order for cows, could also obviate the need for even more economically disruptive measures. Troy Sutton, a virologist at Penn State University, said the emergence of the bird flu in cattle had intensified efforts to understand the virus. It's now moved into a species that humans have more contact with, he said.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "deny_statement_2", "statement": "Federal health officials have sought to reassure Americans poses little risk to people so far."}]}
{"id": "472", "fulltext": "The outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza among U.S. dairy cows, first reported on March 25, has now spread to at least 33 herds in eight states. On Wednesday, genetic evidence of the virus turned up in commercially available milk. Federal authorities say the milk supply is safe, but this latest development raises troubling questions about how widespread the outbreak really is. So far, there is only one confirmed human case. Rick Bright, an expert on the H5N1 virus who served on President Biden's coronavirus advisory board, told me this is the crucial moment. 'There's a fine line between one person and 10 people with H5N1,' he said. 'By the time we've detected 10, it's probably too late to contain. That's when I told him what I'd heard from Sid Miller, the Texas commissioner for agriculture. He said he strongly suspected that the outbreak dated back to at least February. The commissioner speculated that then as many as 40 percent of the herds in the Texas Panhandle might have been infected. Dr. Bright fell silent, then asked a very reasonable question: 'Doesn't anyone keep tabs on this?' The H5N1 outbreak, already a devastating crisis for cattle farmers and their herds, has the potential to turn into an enormous tragedy for the rest of us. But having spent the past two weeks trying to get answers from our nation's public health authorities, I'm shocked by how little they seem to know about what's going on and how little of what they do know is being shared in a timely manner. How exactly is the infection transmitted between herds? The United States Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all say they are working to figure it out. According to many public health officials, the virus load in the infected cows' milk is especially high, raising the possibility that the disease is being spread through milking machines or from aerosolized spray when the milking room floors are power washed. Another possible route is the cows' feed, owing to the fairly revolting fact that the U.S. allows farmers to feed leftover poultry bedding material — feathers, excrement, spilled seeds — to dairy and beef cattle as a cheap source of additional protein. Alarmingly, the U.S.D.A. told me that it has evidence that the virus has also spread from dairy farms back to poultry farms 'through an unknown route.' Well, one thing that travels back and forth between cattle farms and chicken farms is human beings. They can also travel from cattle farms to pig farms, and pigs are the doomsday animals for human influenza pandemics. Because they are especially susceptible to both avian and human flu, they make for good petri dishes in which avian influenza can become an effective human virus. The damage could be vast. The U.S.D.A. also told me it doesn't know how many farmers have tested their cattle and doesn't know how many of those tests came up positive; whatever testing is being done takes place at the state level or in private labs. Just Wednesday, the agency made it mandatory to report all positive results, a long overdue step that is still 'without the negative results alongside them' insufficient to give us a full picture. Also on Wednesday, the U.S.D.A. made testing mandatory for dairy cattle that are being moved from one state to another. It says mandatory testing of other herds wouldn't be 'practical, feasible or necessarily informative' because of 'several reasons, ranging from laboratory capacity to testing turnaround times.' The furthest the agency will go is to recommend voluntary testing for cattle that show symptoms of the illness — which not all that are infected do. Dr. Bright compares this to the Trump administration's approach to Covid-19: If you don't test, it doesn't exist. As for the F.D.A., it tells me it hasn't completed specific tests to confirm that pasteurization would make milk from infected cows safe, though the agency considers it 'very likely' based on extensive testing for other pathogens. (It is not yet clear whether the elements of the H5N1 virus that recently turned up in milk had been fully neutralized.) That testing should have been completed by now. In any case, unpasteurized milk remains legal in many states. Dr. Bright told me that 'this is a major concern, especially given recent infections and deaths in cats that have consumed infected milk.' Making matters worse, the U.S.D.A. failed to share the genomes from infected animals in a timely manner, and then when it shared the genomes did so in an unwieldy format and without any geographic information, causing scientists to tear their hair out in frustration. All this makes catching potential human cases so urgent. Dr. Bright says that given a situation like this, and the fact that undocumented farmworkers may not have access to health care, the government should be using every sophisticated surveillance technique, including wastewater testing, and reporting the results publicly. That is not happening. The C.D.C. says it is monitoring data from emergency rooms for any signs of an outbreak. By the time enough people are sick enough to be noticed in emergency rooms, it is almost certainly too late to prevent one. So far, the agency told me, it is aware of only 23 people who have been tested. That tiny number is deeply troubling. (Others may be getting tested through private providers, but if negative, the results do not have to be reported.) On the ground, people are doing the best they can. Adeline Hambley, a public health officer in Ottawa, Mich., told me of a farm whose herd had tested positive. The farm owner voluntarily handed over the workers' cellphone numbers, and the workers got texts asking them to report all potential symptoms. Lynn Sutfin, a public information officer in the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, told me that response rates to those texts and other forms of outreach can be as high as 90 percent. That's heartening, but it's too much to expect that a poor farmworker afraid of stigma, legal troubles and economic loss will always report even mild symptoms and stay home from work as instructed. It's entirely possible that we'll get lucky with H5N1 and it will never manage to spread among humans. Spillovers from animals to humans are common, yet pandemics are rare because they require a chain of unlucky events to happen one after the other. But pandemics are a numbers game, and a widespread animal outbreak like this raises the risks. When dangerous novel pathogens emerge among humans, there is only a small window of time in which to stop them before they spiral out of control. Neither our animal farming practices nor our public health tools seem up to the task. There is some good news: David Boucher, at the federal government's Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, told me that this virus strain is a close match for some vaccines that have already been formulated and that America has the capacity to manufacture and potentially distribute many millions of doses, and fairly quickly, if it takes off in humans. That ability is a little like fire insurance — glad it exists, but by the time it comes into play your house has already burned down. I'm sure the employees of these agencies are working hard, but the message they are sending is, 'Trust us — we are on this.' One troubling legacy of the coronavirus pandemic is that there was too much attention on telling the public how to feel — to panic or not panic — rather than sharing facts and inspiring confidence through transparency and competence. And four years later we have an added layer of polarization and distrust to work around. In April 2020, the Trump administration ousted Dr. Bright from his position as the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the agency responsible for fighting emerging pandemics. In a whistle-blower complaint, he alleged this happened after his early warnings against the coronavirus pandemic were ignored and as retaliation for his caution against unproven treatments favored by Donald Trump. Dr. Bright told me that he would have expected things to be much different during the current administration, but 'this is a live fire test,' he said, 'and right now we are failing it.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_2", "statement": "Pigs are the doomsday animals for human influenza pandemics.

{"id": "477", "fulltext": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture moved to try to limit spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus among dairy cattle on Wednesday, issuing a federal order that will require an animal to test negative for the virus before it can be moved across state lines. It also requires laboratories and state veterinarians to report to the USDA any animals that have tested positive for H5N1 or any other influenza A virus. In addition, farms that move cattle across state lines and have animals that test positive for H5N1 or any influenza A virus will be required to open their books to investigators, so they can trace movement of cattle from infected herds. But the first signs that H5N1 or any new flu virus was starting to spread from person to person would trigger a race to produce massive amounts of vaccine to try to mitigate the damage a flu pandemic might be expected to cause. While the 2009 H1N1 pandemic is estimated to have killed about a quarter-million people worldwide severe flu seasons sometimes kill more the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic is believed to have killed between 50 million and 100 million people, many times more than Covid-19. The good news: The world makes a lot of flu vaccine and has been doing it for decades. Regulatory agencies have well-oiled systems to allow manufacturers to update the viruses the vaccines target without having to seek new licenses. The United States even has some H5 vaccine in a stockpile that it believes would offer protection against the version of the H5N1 virus infecting dairy cattle, though there would not be nearly enough doses for the entire country. Related: USDA releases H5N1 bird flu genetic data eagerly awaited by scientists The bad news: The current global production capacity isn’t close to adequate to vaccinate a large portion of the world’s population in the first year of a pandemic. And batches of flu vaccine, often (though not always) produced in hen’s eggs, take months to produce. The Covid pandemic saw vaccine manufacturers around the world pump out unprecedented amounts of vaccine in an extraordinarily short period of time. By February 2022, 14 months after vaccination efforts began, it was estimated that 11 billion doses of vaccine had been produced and delivered. Could that record be matched broken? if H5N1 starts a pandemic? Would the profound inequity of the Covid vaccine distribution, which had affluent countries awash with doses while low-income countries waited for supplies, be remedied or repeated? Experts STAT interviewed suggested that in some respects, the world is better positioned to produce pandemic flu vaccines, if the need arises. But a number warned that assuming the successes of Covid vaccine production would automatically influence the speed and scale of pandemic flu vaccine production would be unwise. “You just have a different [production] system for flu vaccines than we developed on the fly for Covid,” said Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, better known as CEPI, an international organization tasked with spurring development of medical countermeasures for diseases that can cause epidemics and pandemics. “And the … system that we developed for Covid can’t just be repurposed for flu.” Let’s explore some of the ways the world is perhaps better prepared than it was in the past, and some of the snarls that could slow efforts to protect against a dangerous pandemic. What the need would be To gain protection against seasonal flu, most people get vaccinated with one dose of vaccine. Young children who’ve never been vaccinated against flu are an exception; kids ages 6 months to 8 years must get two doses of vaccine, at least four weeks apart, the first time they are vaccinated. Why? Because they are considered to be “naive” to influenza, and their immune systems need to be primed (introduced to flu viruses) and then boosted. Anyone over age 8 is likely to have encountered flu before; they’ve already been primed. One dose is sufficient to acquaint immune systems to the evolved versions of previously encountered seasonal flu viruses. But with a brand-new flu virus and H5N1 definitely falls into that category for humans everyone will be naive. So the assumption of pandemic planners is that everyone would need two doses of vaccine in the first season of vaccinating against H5N1. (During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the new virus was distantly related to one that had circulated for much of the previous century, and one dose was adequate for protection. There’s no expectation that would be true with an H5 pandemic.) That math is daunting: The 8.1 billion people worldwide times two is 16.2 billion doses. Babies under the age of 6 months aren’t vaccinated against flu their immune systems aren’t yet sufficiently developed for it to be effective so that number would be a bit lower. But there’s always waste in vaccine delivery, so the 16 billion probably isn’t far off. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy Who’s most at risk? Speaking of kids, there’s a dynamic at play with H5N1 that wasn’t seen in the Covid pandemic, one that adds to the complexity of vaccinating the planet in a flu pandemic. The vast majority of Covid deaths were in older adults; there were relatively few deaths in children. But flu infections are hardest on older adults and little kids. In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it is estimated that nearly 1,300 children under the age of 17 died, a high toll when compared to a typical flu season. And 2009 was mild, in pandemic terms. Furthermore, kids amplify the transmission of flu in communities, Hatchett said, noting the fall wave of the 2009 pandemic in the U.S. started in late summer, when southern states went back to school. A really bad pandemic could change public opinion rapidly, but at present it seems unlikely there would be much appetite for closing schools to slow spread of a new flu virus. School closures are one of the most reviled of the containment measures that were used in the Covid pandemic. “The disease is different. It behaves differently. It has different mortality patterns and different transmission patterns. And we would be in a setup because we’d be coming out of Covid with a Covid mindset and Covid biases that would jeopardize our ability to do the right thing if there were a flu pandemic,” Hatchett said. So while the United States waited into 2022 before starting to vaccinate children against Covid and some countries didn’t vaccinate children at all kids will be in the pool of people who need to be vaccinated when the next flu pandemic hits. What the current production capacity is An assessment of market capacity published by the World Health Organization in January estimated that the combined global supply was 1.2 billion trivalent doses of flu vaccine, which target three flu virus strains at a time. During a pandemic, the vaccine made would target a single virus, the new one. So, in theory, 1.2 billion vaccine doses could become 3.6 billion vaccine doses. More than 85% of those doses are made by seven producers, the WHO analysis said, and over 95% of seasonal vaccine doses are used in high- and upper-middle income countries, which will almost certainly have first dibs on pandemic vaccines. More on this later. Back to the math. How much vaccine would each person need? The 3.6 billion doses would be enough for 1.8 billion people. But that’s only if the same amount of vaccine used to protect against seasonal flu viruses would protect against H5N1. And there we run into another problem. Research done in the mid-2000s found that H5N1 is poorly immunogenic in people; it doesn’t trigger a strong immune response unless it’s administered in large amounts, or is given with a boosting compound known as an adjuvant that broadly stimulates the immune system. In a seasonal flu shot, each component contains 15 micrograms of antigen or vaccine. In that study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, it took two doses of 90 micrograms 12 times the amount used to protect against a strain in the seasonal vaccine to induce what’s thought to be a protective response in just over half of the volunteers. In a world where need will outstrip supply, that’s a wholly unworkable dosage. In the years since, multiple studies have been conducted to see whether adjuvants could lower the amount of antigen needed and stretch supplies. They do. Some studies have even suggested fractional doses, with an adjuvant, could be effective. For example, CSL Seqirus, which supplies flu vaccine to the U.S. market and has a licensed pandemic H5N1 vaccine in the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS), showed that 7.5 micrograms, with an adjuvant, would generate what’s thought to be a protective response in a portion of adults. The studies were small, so the range of the estimates is broad, but between 28% and 64% of volunteers ages 18 through 64 and 17% to 57% of volunteers ages 65 and older developed what is thought to be a protective level of antibodies from the 7.5 microgram shot. Related: Why a leading bird flu expert isn’t convinced that the risk H5N1 poses to people has declined But not all flu vaccine manufacturers use or have proprietary adjuvants. CSL Seqirus and GSK do; Sanofi, a major producer of flu vaccines, currently does not. And the global supply of adjuvants could be a bottleneck in any effort to vaccinate the world against H5N1, experts say. “I would be very curious to know what the global production capacity for the relevant adjuvants that we have data for would be. And I suspect it would be vastly insufficient to what is needed,” Hatchett said. The U.S. has stores of adjuvants in the NPIVS, said David Boucher, director of infectious diseases preparedness and response for the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. How quickly could the U.S. respond? The United States has been doing active pandemic preparedness work for at least the past two decades. It understood that domestic production of flu vaccine would be critical in a pandemic, when borders might close to exports if a situation became dire. (Witness India’s refusal to export Covid vaccines in spring 2021 when it was hit with a huge wave of cases.) The government incentivized development of flu vaccine manufacturing and fill-and-finish operations in the U.S. The country, through ASPR, has worked with flu vaccine manufacturers to develop and test batches of H5N1 vaccines targeting different versions of the virus. H5N1 vaccine has already been tested in children, which will help speed availability for a group that is typically at the end of the testing list. (Manufacturers are reluctant to test vaccines in children until they have lots of adult safety data.) There are currently four types of H5N1 vaccine in the NPIVS, said Boucher. Analysis of the viruses they are based on and the viruses from the cattle outbreaks suggests that two of the stockpiled vaccines are sufficiently close, genetically, to be useful, should this version of the virus take off, the WHO and the CDC have stated. “We have right now two candidate vaccine viruses that are very well matched to the current virus from those we have,” Boucher said. About 10 million doses are being stored in bulk, and “hundreds of thousands” of doses have already been placed in vials. That’s a start. But with two doses needed per person, it would not go very far. Boucher said decisions on who the first doses would go to have yet to be made. Those vaccines haven’t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the agency has a fast-track process for updating flu vaccines, and a lot of recent experience with emergency authorization of pandemic vaccines. It can make this happen fast. “Some fraction” of the doses in the filled vials could be available within weeks, Boucher said, depending on how quickly the regulatory process went. And while the bulk antigen was being put into vials, large-scale manufacturing would kick into gear. He estimated that tens of millions of doses could be manufactured over a four- or five-month period. An ASPR spokesperson later put the figure at about 125 million doses. (Remember, 125 million doses would be enough to vaccinate 62.5 million people, about a fifth of the U.S. population.) Kathleen Neuzil, a longtime influenza vaccine researcher at the University of Maryland who takes over as director of the Fogarty International Center at the National Institutes of Health in early May, studied one of the two stockpiled vaccines that Boucher mentioned. It is based on an H5N8 virus and has the same key component as H5N1. (The major target of a flu vaccine is the hemagglutinin protein on the viruses’ surface, the H in a strain’s name.) Her group tested blood from people vaccinated with it against a virus related to the ones that have been seen in cows, which come from a subgroup of H5N1 known as 2.3.4.4b. Although the vaccine targets a 2.3.4.4c virus a slightly different clade the researchers saw good antibody responses in people who had received two 15-microgram doses of the vaccine, with adjuvant. “We had tested this H5N8 vaccine that’s in the stockpile to that strain, and it had pretty good cross reactivity if you use an adjuvant,” Neuzil told STAT. Would the stockpiled vaccine protect us, if H5 triggers a pandemic? Two vaccine and pandemic preparedness experts who used to work for the FDA recently questioned how useful the stockpiled vaccine would be, in an opinion piece in STAT. “Let’s say that by a miracle that it really is a good match, that it’s protective and all that. It’s available in such limited numbers it’s just not meaningful for the response,” Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at FDA and former member of the National Security Council, said in an interview. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said it would be prudent to remember the vaccine experience of the 2009 pandemic when making projections about how effective the stockpiled vaccine might be against a virus that evolves to be able to spread from person to person. A study of how well the vaccine worked then showed good protection for young people but no discernible protection for older adults. “You had the strain in the vaccine. And you still saw a relative lack of protection that you would expect to have with a closely matched virus,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how long it takes to produce additional doses, if they are needed. Making a new type of flu vaccine requires manufacturers to learn how to grow large volumes of the viruses. Some viruses grow better than others; sometimes it takes time to learn how to optimize growth. In 2009, manufacturers initially struggled to produce adequate supply of viruses, delaying rollout of the vaccines. In fact, though tens of millions of Americans were vaccinated against H1N1 in 2009, the fall wave of that pandemic when the vast majority of U.S. cases occurred had already largely subsided by the time vaccine doses were available in substantial numbers. (Source: The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, the University of Minnesota) Could mRNA vaccines be a wild card? During the Covid pandemic, messenger RNA vaccines which are quicker to make because they don’t require growing supplies of virus hit the market with incredible speed. But it’s not clear what role mRNA vaccines would play in a flu pandemic, if one were to occur soon. Both Pfizer and Moderna, the major mRNA players, are developing flu vaccines they hope to combine with Covid shots in a bid to boost flagging sales of the latter and grab a share of the pretty saturated seasonal flu vaccine market. Both have reported that for influenza A H5N1 belongs to that large flu family their vaccines appeared to induce immune responses similar to those seen generated by traditional flu vaccines. Moderna is currently testing an H5N1 vaccine, from the 2.3.4.4b subset of viruses, in people. That trial began last summer. But the trial’s listing in the Clinicaltrials.gov database is cagey about the dosages Moderna is testing, calling them simply dose number 1, 2 and 3. Christopher Ridley, Moderna’s vice president of communications, said the detail was obscured for “competitive reasons.” Given how likely it is for mRNA vaccines to induce unpleasant side effects, especially at higher doses, and given how poorly immunogenic H5N1 viruses are, finding a sweet spot an mRNA H5 vaccine that would be both effective and tolerable to take could take some work. Hatchett thinks that regulators will want more data before they embrace mRNA vaccines as a solution in a flu pandemic though he and others have noted that in a true crisis, “all bets are off.” “My intuition would be that we are still in a vulnerable period when it’s not just an instant solution,” he said of the mRNA option. “I think if we make the proper investments, we could very soon get to the point where we know what the dose needs to be and have mRNA vaccines against avian strains as part of our arsenal and scale it quickly. I just don’t think we’ve worked that through yet.” Trending Now: H5N1 bird flu virus particles found in pasteurized milk but FDA says commercial milk supply appears safe Boucher said ASPR is looking to add mRNA H5N1 vaccine to the stockpile, having recently issued a request for proposals from manufacturers. It is still assessing the submissions it generated, he said. Seth Berkley, who stepped down last summer after 12 years as CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, raised other questions about mRNA as an option for a pandemic flu response, noting that with the Covid mRNA vaccines, the protection against any infection waned quickly and the vaccines needed to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures, which made them impractical for parts of the world. “But if you were to say, we want to make flu vaccines for the world, would that be mRNA technology? Or … wouldn’t you want a vaccine, probably adjuvanted, that would take a little longer to make, but might be inexpensive and easy to produce and give longer immunity?” Berkeley mused. “We don’t know, but those are the questions that will have to get asked, and they didn’t get asked in Covid because of the emergency we were in.” Will lower-income countries have to wait yet again? In 2009, the Obama administration announced it would donate 10% of the U.S. stocks of vaccine, as they rolled off the manufacturing line, starting after high-risk people in the country were vaccinated. Hatchett was one of the people tasked with running that program. Other countries were persuaded to join, and the WHO led an effort to redistribute vaccine to countries that could not buy their way into the vaccine purchasing lines. Eventually, Hatchett said, about 200 million doses were donated, but by the time they were available, the pandemic had subsided. When the program was wound down in October of 2010, about 80 million doses had been distributed. Fast forward to the Covid pandemic. Nearly 2 billion doses of Covid vaccine were distributed through COVAX, an entity set up by the WHO, Gavi, CEPI, and UNICEF (the United Nation’s Children’s Fund) to try to secure vaccine for countries boxed out of the market. And still, vaccine distribution was hugely inequitable. That fact was part of the inspiration for the ongoing efforts to come up with an international pandemic accord that would try to ensure vaccines, drugs, and other medical essentials are more fairly distributed in the next pandemic. Those efforts have struggled to reach a consensus acceptable to all parties. People who know the flu vaccine market think the dynamics may not be vastly different in the next pandemic than they were in the last two. “I would say even today, it’s true that the countries with the manufacturing capacity will be the countries with the early access to these vaccines,” Neuzil cautioned. An in-depth analysis of global seasonal and pandemic flu vaccine production capacity, led by the WHO and based on 2019 data, showed that low- and middle-income countries made up 38% of the world’s population, but produced 2% of seasonal influenza vaccine. There was no flu vaccine production in Africa, and a Moderna plan to build an mRNA vaccine production facility there was recently shelved, a move the company ascribed to the sharp drop in sales of its Covid vaccine. Hatchett said a problem that existed in 2009 was the fact that high-income countries that bought seasonal flu vaccine had provisions in their contracts that gave them first or early access to pandemic vaccine, if the need arose. When H1N1 emerged, “all of the vaccine that could be produced in Europe was absorbed,” he said. “And I suspect those contingent purchase contracts are probably still in place, and probably you would have the exact same phenomenon again.”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_5", "statement": "And we would be in a setup because we’d be coming out of Covid with a Covid mindset and Covid biases that would jeopardize our ability to do the right thing if there were a flu pandemic."}]}
{"id": "478", "fulltext": "Fragments of the virus that causes bird flu have been found in samples of pasteurized milk, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday, but officials aren't concerned about danger to humans from drinking store-bought milk at this time. Officials told reporters on Wednesday that the milk tested positive for presence of the virus, but the results do not indicate that the virus is currently infectious, as the pasteurization process works to inactivate viruses. The initial positive samples came from a limited number of tests done by researchers on milk at grocery stores. Federal agencies are now doing their own, more robust tests. The FDA said it is conducting further analysis on the positive samples, and is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state partners to investigate. \"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" Donald Prater, the acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA, told reporters. On Wednesday, officials announced a new federal order that will require all dairy cattle to be tested for bird flu before being transported across state lines. Any cows that test positive will have to wait 30 days and retest before being moved, said administrator for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Michael Watson. The avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has recently infected herds of dairy cows in several states, including Texas, Kansas and Michigan. Herds in New Mexico and Idaho are presumed infected, officials said. Both the FDA and the USDA said the current commercial milk supply is safe because of the pasteurization process and the \"diversion or destruction of milk from sick cows.\" The agency pledged to take the situation seriously and release results from multiple studies in the coming days or weeks. What is bird flu? Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a disease that's caused by an avian influenza Type A virus infection, according to the CDC. The disease primarily spreads through contact with infected birds, which can infect their respiratory tract and intestines, according to the CDC. Infected birds can shed viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces. Bird flu is very contagious among birds, and some of the viruses can sicken or kill certain domesticated species, including chickens, ducks and turkeys. Is anyone at risk from drinking milk? Pasteurized milk, which makes up 99% of milk produced on dairy farms and sold in stores, is treated to make sure any viruses in the milk are dead. Experts say drinking this kind of milk is safe, even if fragments of bird flu have been found in some samples. However, raw milk does not receive this treatment. Is raw milk safe to drink? The FDA says people should not drink raw milk. The agency also says the dairy industry shouldn't manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including cheese made with raw milk, from any cows showing symptoms of illness or exposed to other cows that have bird flu. How did virus fragments get into milk? While the pasteurization process is designed to make milk safe by inactivating viruses, it doesn't destroy the virus fragments. \"It's important to understand that fragments, such as genetic material, of those pathogens can still be found in pasteurized milk,\" Prater said. Still, \"pasteurization is very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses, like H5N1 in milk from cows and other species.\" Officials said Wednesday that current studies on how effectively pasteurization kills off bird flu virus are underway, but the process has proven effective in similarly acting viruses for decades, and thermal inactivation has been successful at inactivating bird flu in eggs, which occurs at a lower temperature than in milk. The FDA and its partners are testing samples of milk from store shelves and conducting further analysis on any that show they have bird flu virus to ensure that the virus fragments are inactive, Prater said. Those results will be available in the coming days, he said. What is pasteurization? Named after the scientist Louis Pasteur, pasteurization is a treatment process that applies heat to liquids for short amounts of time, according to the Virginia Department of Health. The process destroys pathogenic microorganisms in some foods and beverages that can cause spoilage and prolongs storage time. Pasteurization was adopted by the FDA as a public health measure to kill dangerous bacteria and viruses, and largely eliminates the risk of getting sick from milk. In 1987, the FDA prohibited the interstate sale of raw, or unpasteurized milk. Can humans get bird flu? There have been a few cases of humans being infected with various strains of bird flu, usually through close contact with sick or dead animals. But experts say the risk to humans is currently low because the disease has not mutated to spread person-to-person. There have been two human cases in the U.S. tied to this strain of bird flu. Among them: On April 1, Texas health officials said a person became infected with bird flu after close contact with infected cows. The CDC said the only symptom reported by the patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis. Public health officials told reporters that 23 people have been tested for bird flu during the current outbreak among cattle and 44 people are being actively monitored after suspected exposure. Officials say risk to public health remains low. The CDC says most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said \"we have not observed changes to the virus' genetic makeup that would suggest an enhanced the ability to spread to humans or among humans.\" \"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, previously told USA TODAY. \"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\" Contributing: Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "deny_statement_1", "statement": "Officials aren't concerned about danger to humans from drinking store-bought milk at this time."}, {"key": "deny_statement_4", "statement": "We have not observed changes to the virus' genetic makeup that would suggest an enhanced the ability to spread to humans or among humans."}]}
{"id": "485", "fulltext": "This is not a repeat of the Covid pandemic. Yet global governments should follow the US and prepare a response. Avian flu, or H5N1, is making headlines in the United States. The past few years have seen concerning signs of it spreading across the world—whether in chickens in Britain, sea lions in Peru, or Caspian seals in Russia. This time, it has been confirmed in American cows, and the World Health Organization has warned that the risk of it spreading to humans is of enormous concern. While it is early days, the hypothesis is that in late 2023, a single cow was infected by coming into contact with infected birds' faeces, or having infected dead birds in its feed. This began cow-to-cow transmission, and potentially even cow-to-bird transmission. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also confirmed one human case of H5N1 in a farm worker, which could either represent cow-to-human (not seen before) or bird-to-human transmission. Since being identified in late March this year (meaning it was spreading for months among cattle unnoticed), the virus has been confirmed in 33 herds in eight states. Given how infectious H5N1 is (the R number can be as high as 100 among birds—meaning each infected bird could infect 100 others—and is still unknown for cows), and the fact cows are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, it's likely that the spread is much farther across the country, and has perhaps reached outside the US to importers of US cattle. The US Food and Drug Administration also noted that it had found traces of the virus in roughly one in five commercially bought milk samples through PCR testing, which detects both live and dead virus fragments. Further testing is being done by the FDA to confirm that pasteurisation kills the virus; early research has found that live virus could not be grown from the milk. The risk to the general population is still considered low, given H5N1 does not appear to transmit from human to human. Those most at risk are farm and poultry workers close to infected animals who get the virus in their eyes, nose or mouth, or inhale droplets at close range. However, the confirmed mammal-to-mammal transmission in the US is concerning to researchers given the potential for further mutations through intermediaries, such as cows, cats or pigs. If mutations enable human-to-human spread, avian flu would become the top priority for governments around the world. The fatality rate is estimated by the World Health Organization at 52%, including young people. The US government is preparing for this scenario with a testing, treatment and vaccine plan. They confirmed this week in a press briefing that Tamiflu, a flu antiviral, is seen to be an effective treatment and is being stockpiled. Two candidate vaccines, which have been stockpiled in the US, also look well matched to this strain. We also know (all too well) that respiratory viruses spread rapidly and are very hard to contain without restrictive measures. But this is a totally different situation to SARS-CoV-2, when it took a year to develop testing, treatments and vaccines for a novel virus—we are much better prepared. The infected cows across the pond have not triggered a UK government briefing or response yet, given that it is seen so far as a US problem, and we import our beef largely from the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands. Unlike poultry, where even one infected bird results in the culling of the entire flock, there's no talk of killing infected cows. They can cost up to $2,500 each, are largely symptom-free, and there's resistance from farmers to having their herds tested given the impact on their business and sales. There is no simple answer for how to contain the virus in cattle, and resolve the tension between human health imperatives and the agricultural industry. In addition, the medical world and veterinary community are notoriously bad at communicating and working together. Prof Rebecca Katz, co-author of The Outbreak Atlas, said: \"This is a perfect example of the importance of operationalising One Health [a unified approach to optimising the health of humans, animals and ecosystems] and collaborations between the animal and human health sectors.\" The main message is there's no need to panic, and this is not a repeat of the Covid-19 pandemic. H5N1 spreading mammal-to-mammal marks a step-change in the development of the disease, and there is an increased risk for humans in close contact with farms in the US. Even if it does spread into humans, the US government seems to be ahead of the curve in preparing a response plan to limit the impact on lives and livelihoods. But other governments would be wise to take heed and plan for all scenarios. To the research community trying to make sense of what's happening, this seems to have come out of the blue—which just shows how wily and unpredictable viruses can be, and how we're in a constant race to stay ahead of them. * Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "The World Health Organization has warned that the risk of it spreading to humans is of enormous concern."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_2", "statement": "The confirmed mammal-to-mammal transmission in the US is concerning to researchers given the potential for further mutations through intermediaries, such as cows, cats or pigs."}]}
{"id": "488", "fulltext": "Federal agencies with competing interests are slowing the country's ability to track and control an outbreak of highly virulent bird flu that for the first time is infecting cows in the United States, according to government officials and health and industry experts. The response has echoes of the early days of 2020, when the coronavirus began its deadly march around the world. Today, some officials and experts express frustration that more livestock herds aren't being tested for avian flu, and that when tests and epidemiological studies are conducted, results aren't shared fast enough or with enough detail. They fear that the delays could allow the pathogen to move unchecked - and potentially acquire the genetic machinery needed to spread swiftly among people. One dairy worker in Texas has already fallen ill amid the outbreak, the second U.S. case ever of this type of bird flu. Officials and experts said the lack of clear and timely updates by some federal agencies responding to the outbreak recall similar communication missteps at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. They point, in particular, to a failure to provide more details publicly about how the H5N1 virus is spreading in cows and about the safety of the milk supply. 'This requires multiple agencies to coordinate and communicate internally, but most importantly externally, which doesn't seem to be happening due to different cultures, priorities, legal responsibilities, scientific expertise, and agility,' said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who writes a weekly infectious-diseases newsletter and has closely tracked the avian flu outbreak. 'Mix that in with the usual challenges of scientific uncertainty, complexity and, quite frankly global pressure, and you got yourself an utterly, unacceptable mess.' A senior administration official said there have been 'no competing interests.' The White House's Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy is coordinating the outbreak response with relevant agencies 'that are working quickly and methodically.' The government is 'committed to sharing results as soon as possible,' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 'This work is an urgent priority as we work to ensure the continued effectiveness of the federal-state milk safety system and reinforce [the Food and Drug Administration's] current assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,' the administration official said. Until Wednesday, testing for H5N1 in dairy herds was voluntary and limited to cows with certain symptoms. The number of tests per farm was limited, too. That protocol provoked sharp criticism from public health experts. With growing evidence that the virus is more widespread than feared among cows, the U.S. Agriculture Department announced Wednesday that lactating dairy cows must be tested for bird flu before moving across state lines, starting Monday. Responsibility for monitoring and containing the outbreak is divided among three agencies. USDA leads the investigation into the virus in cows, the FDA oversees food safety, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is monitoring risks to people. Agencies have given individual updates on their parts of the outbreak investigation, but Wednesday marked the first time since bird flu was detected in cows four weeks ago that CDC, FDA and USDA, along with other agencies, held a news briefing jointly. On Thursday, government scientists shared detailed data at a webinar hosted by the Association of State and Territorial State Health Officials. For weeks, key federal agencies have expressed confidence in the safety of the commercial milk supply, including pasteurized products sold at grocery stores. But it was two weeks before the FDA responded directly to The Washington Post's questions about whether the agency was testing milk on grocery store shelves for H5N1. On Tuesday, the agency confirmed that viral particles had been found 'in some of the samples,' but it declined to provide details. On Wednesday, an FDA official confirmed fragments were found in milk on shelves but declined to say how many samples the agency has tested, how many had virus fragments and where the milk originated. The testing does not indicate whether genetic traces of the virus are active or dead. During the Thursday webinar, Donald A. Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said early results showed 1 of 5 samples had viral fragments, 'maybe with some preponderance for areas with known [infected dairy] herds.' He did not say how many samples were tested, or from what parts of the country. Additional tests must be done to check whether the virus is infectious. Even with these results, the agency has seen nothing to change its assessment that the commercial milk supply remains safe, Prater said. Officials are seeking answers to other key questions: They want to know whether the virus is spreading among cows through mechanical means, such as milking equipment, as evidence suggests, or through the air, which would be more dangerous and lead to more sustained spread. They are also interested in knowing how long livestock will shed virus in their milk once they have recovered from an infection. And, crucially, they will seek to ascertain the risks for human exposure and whether protocols are in place at the state level if additional people test positive. The investigation 'involves different types of samples, different types of studies and really being methodical about how we're approaching answers to those questions around things like ensuring safety of the food supply,' said one senior government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal policy discussions. 'We're not trying to pull the fire alarm here and suggest that there's more of a risk to people than exists,' said another federal health official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. The key to the outbreak resides with the cows. Public health officials and industry experts say the USDA should be doing broader testing to paint a clearer picture of the scale of the outbreak. The government has been too slow in sharing genetic information and epidemiological studies, they said. More routine testing on herds and even other animals would reduce the risk of spreading the virus to other cattle and poultry farms, public health experts and veterinarians have said. 'Given this is a novel outbreak, testing needs to be done widely and rapidly, investigators need to be on affected farms, and scientists and policymakers need to be bringing it all together to set a coordinated plan of action,' Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said in an email last week. Inglesby was the White House testing czar during the Biden administration's coronavirus response. 'This isn't just about protecting U.S. agricultural interests,' said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. 'This is about protecting human health, protecting farmworkers that may be in harm's way and preventing another pandemic from happening.' Nearly three dozen livestock herds in eight states have been infected in the last month. The virus has also spread from dairy farms to poultry farms and infected barn cats. Epidemiologists fear that indicates cows can pass the virus to birds, and possibly other animals, broadening the potential for spread. Scientists who performed genetic analyses of virus taken from infected animals say the tests suggest the outbreak may have been occurring for longer and across more of the United States than previously thought. Michael Worobey, a University of Arizona virologist who led a team of scientists who analyzed 239 genetic sequences released Sunday by the USDA, said the evolutionary tree of the virus 'resoundingly indicates that this outbreak had a single origin and that it had been circulating under our noses for months before it was noticed.' 'The concerning thing was it meant that all of these outbreaks in at least eight different states traced back to a common ancestor that had been around probably since late 2023 and that meant that this outbreak almost certainly has its tendrils all across the U.S. and perhaps beyond,' Worobey said. Scientists trying to piece together the outbreak's genesis said the USDA was too slow in sharing critical genetic data initially, and when 'a big dump' of 239 genetic sequences arrived Sunday, it was not comprehensive. 'Like what samples they are coming from, when exactly they were collected and where exactly they were collected,' said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and principal research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. Public health and veterinary experts say they also want more epidemiological data - including information on the movement of animals, their feed sources and how many workers are on-site - to understand how and where the virus is circulating. Beth Thompson, South Dakota's state veterinarian and president of the National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials, said such information needs to be shared quickly. 'It's like if you just rip one page out of a chapter in a book and hand it to the states, that isn't the whole chapter,' Thompson said. 'We need all of the information to be given back to us.' The lack of more aggressive testing of livestock and transparent data-sharing has frustrated officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, according to another federal health official and a public health expert who were briefed on the response. USDA officials may be constrained by their mission to promote new markets for farmers and protect animal health and welfare, said an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 'They're just twisting themselves into knots because they've got two missions that are, in this instance, pointing in different directions,' the administration official said. The official suggested the agency is operating at a level of urgency closer to a 4 when it should be a 10, the official said. Not true, said USDA spokeswoman Marissa Perry. 'USDA's top priority is containing this emerging animal health issue,' Perry said. While H5N1 is typically fatal in poultry, the disease in infected cows has been relatively mild, and animals have recovered in a week to 10 days, according to agriculture officials. The biggest challenge so far has been identifying farms willing to share samples, said Rosemary Sifford, the USDA's chief veterinary officer. The agency has been testing sick and healthy cows in affected herds, and in recent days began testing in unaffected herds, she said in an interview last week. The virus appears to be spreading in cows that are producing milk 'and the place that those animals are most closely congregated, have the most contact, would be as they're moving through the milking parlor,' Sifford said. 'We are not seeing this virus moving outside the lactating herd.' This strain of avian flu has been circulating for more than 20 years, but its leap into cows is of significant concern, surprising even longtime observers of the virus. While avian flu has infected humans - especially in Asia - the virus has yet to prove able to spread efficiently in people. But the more the virus jumps animal to animal, the greater the chance mutations will emerge that allow sustained person-to-person transmission, the required next step for a pandemic. State health officials have tested at least 23 people; only the dairy worker in Texas, who has since recovered, was confirmed positive. Ongoing surveillance of emergency department visits and flu testing results in regions with bird flu have not identified any unusual or concerning patterns, the CDC's principal deputy director, Nirav Shah, said Wednesday. The risk to the public from bird flu remains low. For dairy farmers, the potential impact on their business is top of mind. 'Lots of farms aren't raising their hands to be tested because they don't want to be known as having an infected herd,' said Keith Poulsen, director of the veterinary diagnostic lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Jamie Jonker, chief science officer for the National Milk Producers Federation, described as appropriate the USDA announcement on testing and interstate movement. But milk producers are waiting for the USDA's detailed guidance to know how many tests may need to be performed on milk cows, estimated to number about 8 million, Jonker said. The testing mandate could help overcome reluctance from some milk producers to allow testing in their herds, the USDA's Mike Watson said Wednesday. The cost of mandatory testing would be reimbursed by the agency. A wide swath of federal agencies are mobilizing in the event the highly pathogenic virus evolves. At highest risk are farmworkers, who, like many in the agriculture sector, are undocumented or do not wish to interact with the government, Shah said. In an emergency call three weeks ago with state health and lab officials, Shah laid out a detailed list of operational questions state officials needed to answer to prepare for potential exposures in people. 'What nurse and what epidemiologist have you trained up to do this? Do you have the [nasal] swabs ready? Do they know how to approach that conversation in a culturally competent and linguistically competent manner? Is the lab ready to go?'

{"id": "490", "fulltext": "On Friday, Colorado became the latest state to detect the bird flu virus spreading in dairy cattle. It follows revelations earlier in the week that viral fragments are turning up in retail milk. Still, scientists don't view this as an immediate threat to human health. Genetic material is not the same as infectious virus and pasteurization is expected to inactivate the virus in milk, but the findings speak to the broader uncertainty about the extent of the spread. \"There's so many critical things that we still need to know to get a better perspective on how bad this is, or maybe it's not so bad,\" says Dr. Rick Bright, a virologist and the former head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Federal health agencies started sharing more details publicly this week, but Bright says there's still not enough transparency. \"It's the void that just leaves everyone nervous,\" he says. Other scientists say the reality is that there are still many unresolved questions about this outbreak, given how novel it is. \"There's a couple big unknowns at this point,\" says Louise Moncla, a virologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. Here's what scientists who are tracking the virus still want to know: How widespread is the virus in dairy cattle? That's still far from clear. While the official tally shows it's been detected in nine states and just over 30 herds, the actual number could be much larger. First of all, there hasn't been widespread testing in cattle. The fact that viral material is now being found in retail milk suggests \"this virus is probably spread around quite a bit,\" says Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee. On Thursday, the FDA said that preliminary results from nationwide samples of retail milk indicate about one in five samples are positive for viral traces. A survey of retail milk in the Midwest found 58 out of 150 samples were positive, according to Andrew Bowman at the Ohio State University. Webby discovered this himself when he went to the store to grab a carton of milk, which he intended to use as a negative control in his work on H5N1. To his surprise, even that ended up being positive (unfazed, he kept the milk). Currently the virus has only been detected in a tiny fraction of dairy herds in the U.S., but it's hard to know the significance of that finding when you don't also have details on the overall number of cattle tested, says Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Centers for Health Security. \"Those are kind of basic questions that would really help get us more ground truth quickly,\" he says. The USDA has just taken some new steps that could offer a better picture of the outbreak. There will be mandatory reporting of positive tests in cattle and a requirement that dairy cattle test negative for the virus before they move across state lines. Potentially complicating the picture: Some unknown number of cattle could be shedding the virus without showing obvious symptoms. Federal health officials have confirmed this. \"We don't know how many animals have this,\" says Alexis Thompson, a veterinarian at Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. \"There has been very little sampling done. We don't know how many [sick] animals we have. We don't know how many asymptomatic animals we have. That testing has not been done.\" Because milk from sick cows is supposed to be discarded, this could help explain how remnants of the virus entered the milk supply. If it turns out there are lots of animals shedding the virus and not symptomatic, the outbreak could be \"substantially larger\" than we realize, says Inglesby. \"To get to the bottom of that, we would need to do surveillance testing in places that don't already have clear outbreaks.\" Does the milk testing positive on retail shelves contain infectious virus? So far, it doesn't appear that way, but scientists who are studying this possibility acknowledge it's too soon to say that with absolute certainty. The PCR testing that has found evidence of viral fragments in the milk on grocery store shelves doesn't actually tell you whether or not it's \"live\" virus, meaning whether it's capable of replicating. This form of testing is extraordinarily sensitive and detects small pieces of genetic material, says Lee-Ann Jaykus, a food microbiologist at North Carolina State University. \"There's evidence that that milk at one point in time may have had virus associated with it, but there is no evidence that that virus would be infectious, at least with the information we currently have,\" she says. Pasteurizing milk can knock out bacteria and viruses; however, it doesn't erase every trace of those germs. Federal health officials have stressed that avian influenza doesn't stand up well to the high temperatures and past research on pasteurization indicates \"it's very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses like H5N1 in milk from cows.\" \"We've seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" said Don Prater from the Food and Drug Administration. Research on pasteurization in eggs, which happens at a lower temperature than milk, shows that the process inactivates the bird flu virus. Jaykus and other scientists agree that finding viral material doesn't necessarily suggest an immediate threat to human health. \"It's really important to sort of not get out of control about fear of consuming milk,\" says Jaykus. There is an important caveat though: There has been no direct research on how pasteurizing cow milk affects bird flu virus. Those studies are taking place right now. Early experiments on a small number of samples suggest there is no viable virus in these positive samples, said Jeanne Marrazzo, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Webby, who looked at samples of milk sent by Bowman, says they tried to grow the virus in cultured cells and embryonated chicken eggs — two places where flu loves to grow — and found that it did not reproduce. \"It's pretty good evidence,\" he says, \"We could never say there's none, but we could say if it's there, it's at a very, very, very low level.\" Jaykus says even if the milk did happen to have a small amount of infectious virus, \"there just isn't evidence that that is a transmission route for flu.\" Rick Bright, on the other hand, has more concerns about the milk. \"It's a small inconvenience for me not to drink milk until we have more data,\" he says, \"It doesn't mean that I think everyone should stop drinking milk. It's a personal risk assessment.\" He says the key question is how much virus is in the milk, and whether that changes if more cows get sick and more virus enters the milk supply. \"The higher the viral load in the milk, the more difficult it is for pasteurization to work completely,\" he says. \"If they show at this point there's no viable virus in the milk, that's a point in time. And what's going to be really critical is that the FDA continues to monitor this.\" How exactly is the virus spreading? For weeks, the leading theory has been that the primary route of spread is through the milk. This is where high concentrations of the virus are being found. This general idea was affirmed again this week by Mike Watson with the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, who said the evidence still points to some form of \"mechanical transmission.\" Virus could be spread on \"milking equipment,\" by \"individuals moving from facility to facility,\" and via rodents that come in contact with milk and then move around, he said. Federal health officials and scientists believe the virus has moved with lactating cattle from one herd to another. But how it's getting from one cow to another on a given farm \"is a key missing piece of knowledge,\" says Webby. Genetic sequencing indicates that there was likely a single introduction from birds into cattle, which then resulted in further spread among cattle, says Moncla, who has been analyzing the genomic data. \"A lot of these cattle sequences are quite similar to each other, suggesting that there's almost certainly some degree of cattle-to-cattle transmission going on,\" she says. Moncla says it's hard to say exactly how long the virus has been spreading through dairy cattle, although some scientists have suggested it may have been circulating for many months, even earlier than February. The USDA has also noted another concerning development — that there have been some instances of the virus moving from domesticated poultry to cattle. \"The degree of transmission, combined with the fact that we're likely missing cases in cattle, leads to a bit of concern,\" says Moncla. What is the risk to humans as the virus keeps spreading? First the reassuring news: Even with all these cows being infected, there has only been one documented human infection during the current outbreak in dairy cattle. That person, a dairy worker in Texas, had conjunctivitis. This week, federal health officials reiterated that the overall risk to the general public remains low, in part because \"we have not observed changes to the virus's genetic makeup that would suggest an enhanced ability to spread to humans or among humans,\" said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the CDC. So far, states have tested 23 people for avian flu and have monitored 44 people who were considered exposed and at risk for infection, he said. Generally, cases of bird flu are rare in humans and it takes a big dose of virus — for example through direct contact while slaughtering poultry — to get infected. Since 2022, there have been 26 human cases of H5N1 virus infection reported worldwide. Webby says it is possible that cows don't put that much \"pressure on the virus to change,\" which could be one reason scientists haven't seen alarming mutations in the samples collected. \"I don't think the needle has moved at all\" in terms of human risk, he says. Of course, the perennial fear is that the virus could mutate while in cows, or an intermediary animal, and then find its way into humans. Scientists have documented some mutations in bird flu when it has spread in other mammals. But previous research has shown there needs to be a host of changes — most of all, the virus would have to evolve a way to bind to receptors in the upper airway of humans — to become a pandemic threat. When it comes to cattle, the CDC's Sonja Olsen says they still aren't sure if it's the exposure to raw milk on the farms that's the primary risk to humans. \"We don't know if it's [surface] transmission. We don't know if there's aerosolization of the milk.\" Dr. Bright says the CDC should be conducting antibody studies on dairy workers to see if human cases have escaped detection, rather than waiting for cases to show up in the emergency room. \"I am going to keep my radar up,\" he says. \"If this were to get out of hand, we have to be prepared to respond really quickly. And I'm not quite sure we're fully ready to respond if we needed to.\" Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit NPR. Copyright © 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"id": "493", "fulltext": "Scientists who know about the types of pathogens — E. coli and Salmonella among them — that can be transmitted in raw milk generally think drinking unpasteurized milk is a bad idea. But right now, they believe, the danger associated with raw milk may have gone to a whole new level. “If I were in charge, for the moment I would forbid the selling of raw milk,” said Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, who has done research on H5N1 and the damage it inflicts for about two decades. H5N1 bird flu has been circulating in dairy cow herds in multiple parts of the country, likely for months now. Testing of milk from infected cows shows the virus is present in concentrations that have taken scientists by surprise. They worry that if a raw-milk consumer inadvertently drank milk from infected cows, the results could be bad — potentially really bad. “I absolutely wouldn’t go anywhere near raw milk in terms of consuming it,” said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., whose laboratories have been involved in testing to see if evidence of H5N1 RNA can be found in commercially purchased milk — it can — and whether live virus can be grown from pasteurized milk containing H5N1 RNA. So far it looks like the answer to that question is no. FURTHER READING Deeper look: H5N1 bird flu Genetic analysis suggests the H5N1 flu virus outbreak in cows likely started earlier than originally thought. Video explainer: Traces of the avian flu virus have been found in grocery store milk. Here's what we know about pasteurization, the H5N1 virus, and consumer safety. In a widespread bird flu pandemic, could the world produce enough H5N1 vaccine to protect the entire population? A look at lessons in preparedness from Covid-19. STAT First Opinion essay: Humans have no natural immunity to the H5N1 virus. The discovery of avian flu in U.S. cattle is a wake-up call to action. While the Food and Drug Administration bans the interstate sale and distribution of raw milk, rules surrounding its use in an individual state are set by the state legislature. Some ban the sale of raw milk for human consumption; others allow it under a variety of circumstances. (A state-by-state rundown is here.) Kuiken said his concern about the risk that infected raw milk poses is not so much that the practice might somehow help the virus to mutate in ways that would allow it to spread easily to and among people — in other words, trigger a pandemic. But he believes it would likely seriously sicken people who drink raw milk from an H5N1-infected cow. Reports of the amount of virus present in infected udders is higher than anything he’s seen in studies where he’s experimentally infected animals with H5N1 to chart the illness the virus wreaked, Kuiken said. Jürgen Richt, a veterinarian and director of the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases at Kansas State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, spoke with a note of disbelief in his voice about the amount of dead viruses or viral particles being found in commercial milk that tested positive for the virus. “From [results] I have seen, I wouldn’t want to drink raw milk,” Richt said. “And I wouldn’t feed it to my cats, nor my dogs, nor my calves, if I’m on a farm.” The FDA is urging consumers not to drink raw milk or eat raw milk cheeses. That is a position the agency has long held, because of the other health risks these products hold, but it has re-emphasized it in the current context. It has also recommended the dairy industry not “manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including raw milk cheese, made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those infected with avian influenza viruses or exposed to those infected with avian influenza viruses.” Kuiken said he is less concerned about raw milk cheeses, saying the various processes involved in cheesemaking are “not conducive to survival of infectious virus.” He did suggest, though, that raw milk cheesemakers could be at risk, if they were inadvertently using milk laced with H5N1 virus. Related: Cattle testing for H5N1 bird flu will be more limited than USDA initially announced Whether herds owned by farmers who sell raw milk have been infected by the virus isn’t publicly known. While authorities and scientists believe outbreaks are occurring over a much broader swathe of the country than has been detected, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has only confirmed infections of 33 herds in nine states — Texas, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Idaho, Ohio, South Dakota, North Carolina, and Colorado. It has not given any details about the operations on which infected animals were found. But the USDA has admitted some farmers have been refusing to test their animals. And analysis of the genetic sequences of viruses retrieved from cows combined with evidence of H5N1 RNA in commercial milk found in a number of U.S. markets — the FDA said Thursday that about 1 in 5 samples tested for H5N1 from across the country have been positive — bolster the argument that this has been going on for longer than has been recognized and likely involves far more herds than have tested positive. The testing of commercial milk was done by polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. In PCR testing, the concentration of a pathogen is estimated by how many cycles the test has to run to find it. The lower the cycle threshold — known as a “Ct value” — the higher the concentration. Anything with a cycle threshold of 29 or lower is considered a strongly positive result. Some milk testing has shown a Ct value of below 10, Kuiken said. Webby, who is also the director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals (located at St. Jude), said drinking raw milk that is infected with H5N1 could deliver a whopping dose of virus to a person’s system — enough to trigger a fatal infection in lab studies where small animals are experimentally infected with H5N1. “Of course, we don’t know what a lethal dose, or even infectious dose, is in humans. But it makes absolutely no sense to me that you’d want to try,” he said. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy We think of flu viruses as pests that plague our upper and sometimes lower respiratory tracts, causing congestion, sneezing, fever, coughing, and in some cases triggering pneumonia. Because of their biology, the influenza A viruses that routinely transmit among people — H1N1 and H3N2 — are effectively limited to infecting the cells in the respiratory tract, said Florian Krammer, an influenza virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. But H5N1 has more tricks up its sleeve than seasonal flu viruses do; it can infect organs other than the lungs. Kuiken noted that the virus has been seen to move into the liver, the central nervous system and the brain, among other tissues. He saw the latter when he experimentally infected cats in the mid-2000s. Similar results were seen when baby goats were infected with the virus on a Minnesota farm in March. Ten of the kids died; necropsies on five of them showed virus in the brains and other organs. Many of the animal species infected in the wild have been reported to sustain damage outside of the respiratory tract. It’s believed these animals — bears, raccoons, seals, foxes, and a raft of other mammals — became infected by eating sick or dead wild birds or poultry infected with the virus. “So many, many species, they get a brain infection and brain disease, not a pulmonary disease,” Kuiken said. “In some cases the disease is missed because people are expecting pneumonia. If the animal is found dead, they don’t see the neurologic signs, and they forget to test the brain.” Human infection with flu occurs when people breathe viruses emitted by others into their upper respiratory tracts. But the shared real estate of the top of the respiratory and gastric tracts make it impossible to rule out the possibility that ingestion of food or drink that contained high levels of viable H5N1 virus could trigger infection, scientists said. Krammer said there are several mechanisms that could come into play. “You could get infection of cells in the upper respiratory tract that could go down and cause lower respiratory tract infection. There could be a route where it’s really going to the olfactory bulb,” he said, going from there to the brain. “And there’s the other option that it really makes it through the stomach … and then you start an infection from the mid gut.” Krammer said he thought that last option was unlikely; he thinks stomach acids would inactivate the virus. But Kuiken doesn’t believe that’s necessarily true, referring to his study of H5N1 in cats. Milk acts as a buffer, he said. “It’s the perfect fluid for [virus] reaching the intestine in an infectious state.” Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the WHO’s department of epidemic and pandemic preparedness, pointed to another outbreak, involving another virus and another animal species — the MERS coronavirus, which spreads to people from camels — as an example of where ingestion of virus-laced milk may have triggered infection of a respiratory disease. Some cases of MERS were traced to the drinking of raw camel’s milk, Van Kerkhove said, though she noted it wasn’t generally possible to tease out whether it was the drinking of the milk or the act of milking that led to the infections. (Influenza viruses and coronaviruses belong to different families.) She acknowledged that some people take comfort from the notion that stomach acids would kill H5N1, but said it is important to look for evidence-based answers. The experts STAT spoke to for this story said it would also be prudent for public health authorities looking for possible human cases of H5N1 to cast their net broadly, given that ingestion of the virus might trigger symptoms not typically associated with influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it is monitoring emergency room data for unusual cases of flu and for conjunctivitis. (There has only been one confirmed case associated with the dairy cow outbreaks to date, a farm worker in Texas who had conjunctivitis.) “I think that’s why it’s also important to look out for all kinds of weird syndromes that might come up in the areas where there is more exposure and people have more exposure to dairy cattle,” Krammer said. “It could be neurological. It could be basically conjunctivitis. It could be more traditional respiratory infections. But also, something new could come up.” “In a way, we think we know H5, but the cow trick was completely new and we don’t know what the virus would do when it goes into humans. Maybe it does something very unexpected. There’s just not enough data to say anything conclusive. So I think people should just be watchful,” he said. Richt agreed. “Expect the unexpected. That’s the situation we deal with here.”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_5", "statement": "In a way, we think we know H5, but the cow trick was completely new and we don’t know what the virus would do when it goes into humans.

{"id": "494", "fulltext": "After a dairy worker in Texas was infected with a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, disease trackers worry the recent outbreak among cattle could develop into a larger threat. Federal officials are now requiring lactating dairy cows to test negative for the virus before moving across state lines. The risk to the general public remains low, but experts are concerned about the possibility of the H5N1 virus evolving and more easily spreading from birds to other mammals. Here's what to know about bird flu, its symptoms and treatment, and its risk to humans and pets. What is bird flu? Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in more than 9,000 wild birds and has affected more than 82 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since early 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm. Can humans catch bird flu? It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds—whether the birds are dead or alive—or with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces. Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks—probably from eating infected wild birds—experts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. Two human cases have been reported in the United States, including the case in Texas, which the CDC announced Monday. The first case was in 2022, when a person in Colorado with direct exposure to poultry tested positive for the same strain. Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis—an eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes—to more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said. The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain. A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus—by sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example—to develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. \"In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia,\" he said, and then \"the fatality rate is very high.\" Is it safe to drink milk and eat cheese and yogurt? Federal agencies are reassuring the public about the nation's dairy supply after the bird flu was recently found in dairy cows and viral fragments were discovered in milk sold at grocery stores. Experts say the mere presence of viral particles is not surprising and does not mean people can get infected by consuming products containing them. Since milk products are pasteurized, \"there continues to be no concern about the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,\" the Food and Drug Administration said in a notice on its website. That applies to other dairy products, including cheese, yogurt and ice cream, but officials are doing additional studies to see if there are any differences with other milk products containing viral fragments. Only milk from healthy animals is authorized to be distributed into interstate commerce for humans to consume, the agency said, adding that \"pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza.\" That means there hasn't been much impact on the country's supply of milk or the cost of dairy products. Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs? No. Humans cannot become infected by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs. However, according to the CDC, \"uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia.\" The CDC advises that \"it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States.\" Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry—and other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry—are typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. \"It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products,\" she said. \"They don't even make it into your pet food.\" What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans? Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms—fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing. The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the past 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said. Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat. How is it treated? People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said. Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans? Yes, there are vaccines for the bird flu. But they would need to be tested to determine whether they are a match for this specific strain. Vaccine manufacturing would then need to be scaled up and mass-produced. Can bird flu kill humans? Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare. According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and February 2024, 887 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 were reported globally from 23 countries. Of those who were infected, there were 462 deaths. While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Could bird flu become the next pandemic? Each time there is a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person. That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people. Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchange of genetic material is a random event. \"If anything, the odds are against it,\" Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although the strain has infected some mammals—including mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm in October 2022—that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans,\" he said. Can dogs and cats catch bird flu? Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said. Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons. \"If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection,\" Cardona said. What about my backyard chickens? People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said. Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease. Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying. People who have backyard chickens should take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said. Does risk vary by state or country? Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk-free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. \"The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds, and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable,\" Iqbal said. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world. Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu? China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality. But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks. Britain, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly. In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds that may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed. Should you worry birds in your area are spreading avian flu? Wild birds—such as ducks, geese and swans—are most likely to be infected with this strain of bird flu, according to the CDC. It can easily be spread to poultry, like chickens and turkey. However, the most common songbirds or other birds found in backyards—like cardinals, robins and pigeons—don't usually carry bird flu viruses dangerous to poultry or humans. Generally, people should avoid direct contact with wild birds, the CDC states. What precautions are federal and state health officials recommending? Federal and state health officials are recommending that people avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals, including cattle, as well as animal carcasses, raw milk, feces, litter or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection. An order issued by the U.S. Agriculture Department requires lactating dairy cows to be tested before moving across state lines. Those that test positive would have to wait 30 days and test negative before being moved, officials said. People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or food products, including unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheeses, from animals with confirmed or suspected bird flu. CDC is recommending that farmers and owners of poultry, backyard flock and livestock wear personal protective equipment, such as N95 masks, eye protection and gloves, as well as wash their hands thoroughly when in direct contact—or entering any buildings—with sick or dead birds or other animals, carcasses, or feces or litter of potentially infected animals. People exposed to birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection should be monitored for symptoms of illness for 10 days after the last known exposure, even if they were wearing recommended personal protective equipment.

{"id": "502", "fulltext": "The H5N1 bird flu virus has been around for decades, and the damage it wreaks on chickens and other poultry is well documented. But the recent discovery that the virus has jumped into dairy cattle—whose udders seem to be where the virus either infects or migrates to—has dumbfounded scientists and agricultural authorities. Questions for which there are pretty clear answers when it comes to birds are suddenly unsettled science in cows. How are they getting infected? Are they transmitting the virus cow to cow, or are human actions—activities that are part of the day-to-day of farming—serving as an unrecognized amplifier of viral transmission? In the interface between infected cows and humans, how might people be at risk? Does consuming milk laced with live H5 virus pose a hazard? At this point in the H5N1-in-cows story, these are questions that don’t have solid answers, though some evidence is coming into focus. Getting answers is critical, for controlling spread among cows, if that’s still possible; stopping transmission from cows to key species like poultry or pigs; and keeping the virus from getting a foothold in the human population. Let’s explore the little we know, and the much more we don’t know. Are cows spreading the virus the way people transmit flu? Wash your hands; cover your cough; wear a mask. These are things public health officials advise at the start of each flu season. That’s because the influenza viruses that typically infect humans spread primarily through the air either through small, virus-laced particles that can be inhaled, or through larger droplets that spray out of a sick person’s mouth when they cough or sneeze. Related: Massive amounts of H5N1 vaccine would be needed if there’s a bird flu pandemic. Can we make enough? Scientists are now trying to figure out if cows are passing around the H5N1 bird flu in the same way. So far, it seems possible, but unlikely to be the main driver of disease transmission. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said few tests from the respiratory tracts of infected cows have come back positive and those that did showed there wasn’t a lot of virus present. But there is at least some evidence that H5N1 is on occasion getting deep into the respiratory tracts of cows. The USDA said in a frequently asked questions document it released last week that its National Veterinary Services Laboratories had found H5N1 in a lung tissue sample from an asymptomatic dairy cow that originated from an affected herd. So what is the main driver of infection among cows? While the contribution of respiratory transmission is still in question, there appears to be little doubt that a lot of spread is happening in milking parlors, where cows are strapped into the milking machines, and that in dairy cows, H5N1 seems to be primarily infecting mammary glands. The amount of virus in the udders of infected cows is off-the-charts high, making it easy to see how one cow’s infection soon becomes a herd’s problem. “You can imagine that if such a cow is milked in a milking stall, even a few drops of milk remaining on the teat cup which is used to milk will then subsequently contaminate the teat of the next cow,” said Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. “So you can imagine very easily how, in the course of a few days, the virus could spread very fast among the cows being milked on that farm.” That fits with other evidence: the fact that infections so far appear to be limited to lactating dairy cows, and that the members of a herd that are the biggest milk producers which are also the animals that stay on milking machines the longest are the ones most heavily impacted by the disease. “There’s still a lot that’s unknown, but what we’re seeing right now is not a respiratory disease by and large; it’s a mastitic disease,” said Jared Taylor, a professor of veterinary pathobiology at Oklahoma State University. For now, that’s somewhat reassuring, because it means that increased attention to sterilization and disinfection during milking should make a dent in the virus’s further spread. But he stressed that it’s still early and researchers are just starting to study the extent to which there could be respiratory involvement. Related: There’s never a good time to drink raw milk. But now’s a really bad time as bird flu infects cows Taylor noted another worry: H5N1, which is notorious for its ability to evolve, is being given a huge opportunity to adapt to bovine hosts. “The concern is if it becomes effective as a respiratory pathogen in cattle, it’s more likely to become effective as a respiratory pathogen in humans,” he said. When are infected cows most contagious? Little is known about how a cow’s contagiousness changes over the course of an infection with H5N1. Researchers examining outbreaks among dairy cattle in Kansas and Texas found that on affected farms, incidence of the disease peaked four to six days after the first animals began showing symptoms such as lethargy, fever, reduced feed intake, and an abrupt drop in milk production. The spread tapered off within 10 to 14 days, and most animals were slowly returned to regular milking after they recovered. But researchers have not yet systematically and repeatedly collected samples from affected animals to understand how much virus they are harboring inside their noses or shedding into milk over the course of their infection. Those are among the types of studies that are urgently needed, Donald Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration, said during an online symposium last week organized by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). “As these animals become infected, what does that profile look like for viral shedding?” Such research would help answer the question of how much H5N1 virus a cow needs to come in contact with to get infected the so-called “infectious dose.” Right now, that remains unknown, Prater said. Can cows be infected but not show symptoms? Can those cows shed virus in milk or spread virus to other cows? There’s been so little testing going on and so little disclosed about the numerators and denominators of that testing that it’s hard to gauge how big an issue asymptomatic infection is and what role, if any, it is playing in transmission within and among herds. But the information USDA released about the virus having been found in the lung of an asymptomatic cow is clear proof that not all infected cows have outward signs of illness. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy Rosemary Sifford, the agency’s chief veterinary officer, said during the ASTHO symposium that little is known about cow-to-cow spread via the respiratory route, but she gave an example of apparent transmission from presymptomatic animals. (A person with flu can be contagious a day before developing symptoms.) Sifford noted that cows in a herd without symptoms tested positive after cattle were moved into it from another herd whose remaining animals then went on to develop symptoms. The positive cows in the second herd haven’t developed symptoms, she said. “We are just getting underway with those studies to give us an idea of the opportunity for viremia either ahead of or after clinical signs,” she said. “So we should have more information about that in the coming weeks.” One such study will be taking place in the high-containment laboratories at Kansas State University’s Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases. Director Jürgen Richt said his group already has the necessary approvals and hopes to begin the research in mid-May. They will be experimentally infecting lactating and non-lactating cows with the version of H5N1 that has been found in cattle herds, both by the oral-nasal route and by directly injecting the virus into udders. The goal: To see where the virus goes in the cows and how they shed it. Is it just found in milk? Or in feces and urine too? Some uninfected cows will be housed with the infected animals to see whether they contract the virus, Richt said. As to whether infected cows that have no symptoms are shedding virus in their milk, the evidence of viral traces in commercially purchased milk brings that question to the forefront. Farmers are supposed to discard milk from infected cows, which reportedly looks odd yellowish and unusually thick. But PCR testing of commercially sold pasteurized milk has shown a substantial portion of samples were positive for RNA from H5N1, indicating the presence of either viral fragments or dead viruses. (The FDA said last week about one in five samples purchased in a cross-country survey tested positive.) So either some farmers aren’t following the recommendation, or some milk isn’t noticeably altered, or some cows that aren’t known to be sick are shedding the virus in their milk. What is it about milking parlors that allows transmission to occur? Milking parlors are typically enclosed buildings outfitted with individual stalls arranged in a ring or in rows where dairy cows are led two to three times each day to drain their udders of milk. In a milking operation, the stimulus to secrete milk comes not from the sight or touch of a calf but is usually provided by a farm worker. That person also cleans the animal’s teats with a damp cloth and then dips them into a disinfectant solution to protect them from infectious bacteria present on a farm. The teats are then attached to the milking unit, also called a claw, which consists of a cluster of four rubber or silicon-based liners that fit snugly around each teat. The milking lasts about six to nine minutes per animal, and then each cow receives another disinfectant treatment before it’s ushered out and another animal is brought in. Related: Cattle testing for H5N1 bird flu will be more limited than USDA initially announced The problem is that the milking equipment that comes into contact with the cow’s udders is typically not sanitized between individual animals, said Nigel Cook, a professor in Food Animal Production Medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and long-time dairy cow health researcher. Rather, sanitization steps happen only two or three times a day. “Contamination of the milking unit with milk residue cross-contaminating to the next cow would be a risk as it would with any mastitis pathogen,” Cook told STAT via email. Liners also have to be regularly replaced, as wear and tear and chemical exposure make them lose their elasticity, becoming rough and split. When that happens, the liners are more difficult to disinfect and can act as a reservoir for infection. Liners, dip cups, washrags, and milkers’ gloved hands are all possible means of spreading the virus from one animal to the next. Washrags used on different animals are often laundered together before repeat use, but some dairies don’t use hot water, and researchers have found genetic traces of H5N1 on both used and clean rags using PCR testing. More work is needed to figure out which vectors are playing the biggest role, scientists told STAT. Kuiken is a bit pessimistic about whether, once the virus has found its way into a herd, transmission can be stopped: “You can’t not milk. And you probably can’t milk so well as to prevent cow-to-cow spread. I don’t think you can do it.” What puts people working on dairy farms at highest risk? Only one human infection a Texas dairy farm worker who developed conjunctivitis has been reported, but anecdotal reports abound of other farm workers with conjunctivitis and mild respiratory symptoms. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working to figure out where the biggest risks to these workers lie, Sonja Olsen, associate director for preparedness and response in CDC’s influenza division, said during the ASTHO symposium. Is it exposure to cows? Contact with milk? Are there specific activities on farms or in slaughterhouses that put people at elevated risk of contracting H5N1? The CDC recommends that people working with or around cattle suspected or confirmed to be infected with H5N1 wear gloves, disposable fluid-resistant coveralls, vented safety goggles or a face shield, and an N95 respirator. Related: Washington kicks into gear on H5N1 Kuiken said the setup of many milking parlors is almost tailor-made to put workers in contact with viruses being shed in milk. That’s because there is typically a well think of the area under the hoist in the garage where your car gets repaired where workers are located while cows are being milked. “So the milk worker is standing in a depressed area, and therefore his eyes are about at knee level a little bit higher, maybe with the cow. So very good for being inoculated, for eye infection,” he said. “They can milk the cow beforehand just a little bit, and the spray of milk will come out of the teat. That’s one way of getting infected. Taking off or putting on the teat cups is one way. The cows are defecating and urinating during the milking process, or afterwards. They clean the [milking parlor] using a high-pressure hose. So there are all different ways in which these milk workers can easily become infected.” Cook is also concerned about the possibility that the high pressure hoses that are used to spray down the parlors after milking may be aerosolizing virus that has fallen to the floor, making it easier for cows and humans to breathe in. He and other colleagues at the University of Wisconsin have begun deploying air monitoring devices into the milking parlors of affected farms to investigate the extent to which they can find genetic evidence of the virus in the air. If so many dairy farm workers have been and are being exposed to H5N1, why has only one human infection been confirmed? Is that plausible? Not likely. Farmers, who mostly haven’t been willing to have their cows tested, haven’t been keen to have their workers tested either. The CDC’s Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, admitted as much last week. “These situations are challenging. There may be owners that are reluctant to work with public health to say nothing of individual workers who may be reluctant to sit down with somebody who identifies themself as being from the government in some way.” There have been reports that some farms may employ undocumented workers. Related: Genetic analysis reveals H5N1 flu virus outbreak in cows likely started earlier than thought Dairy farm workers presenting with milder signs of illness, like conjunctivitis, also would make cases harder to spot. If only conjunctivitis is occurring, though, that presents another potential clue that people aren’t currently getting sick by breathing in H5N1, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who studies emerging zoonotic pathogens at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. In the rare cases where people have contracted H5N1 from birds mostly poultry farm workers and people with small backyard flocks infections have resulted from close contact or exposure to aerosolized poultry waste. Since 2003, there have been 889 confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1; of those 52% were fatal. “It’s entirely possible that there have been a lot of human cases from cows and people are just getting it in a different way,” Rasmussen said. “What that says about the risks to farm workers and dairy processing staff on a given farm or milking parlor is really unclear to me and it’s also something we need to urgently catch up on.” Should more be done to find infected people? The World Health Organization appears to be concerned about the possibility of undetected human cases. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the department of epidemic and pandemic preparedness, told STAT she’d like to see, among other things, studies looking for antibodies to H5N1 in the blood of farm workers and people who’ve been in contact with farm workers, to determine if there have been unreported cases and possibly even spread from those individuals to others. “For every human case of avian influenza since its emergence in 1996, 1997, there has always been … active case-finding, extensive testing, serologic surveys around humans. And we would certainly want to see that in any country, including in the U.S.,” said Van Kerkhove. “I’ve heard and read quite a bit about some potential additional cases. We’ve heard maybe conjunctivitis or whatnot. But I think what’s really critical now is to understand the extent of infection in humans.” “The more we look, potentially the more we can find. And if we’re not looking, then we’re perhaps missing something that could be quite significant.” Could people become infected by drinking milk containing H5N1 viruses? Research is still being done to determine if all pasteurization techniques there are multiple approaches inactivate the virus. But the findings so far are reassuring. Scientists at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., have reported that while they could find genetic evidence of the virus in milk bought in stores, they could not grow live viruses from that milk, suggesting pasteurization kills H5N1. But given the concentration of virus that researchers are seeing in milk from infected cows, they believe that raw milk milk that has not been pasteurized is an entirely different story. Because so little testing has been reported, it’s really not known how many herds in how many parts of the country have been or are currently infected with H5N1. The USDA has reported 34 outbreaks in nine states since late March. It has not disclosed whether any of those dairy farms sold raw milk. Nor is it known if any raw milk producers have had bird flu infections in their cows. If cows that produce milk destined for the raw milk market got infected with H5N1, people who consume that milk could drink a large dose of the virus, scientists say. Kuiken said he’s heard of concentrations that would be the equivalent of a billion virus particles per milliliter of milk. He told STAT he thought authorities should ban raw milk sales while the outbreak is underway.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "The concern is if it becomes effective as a respiratory pathogen in cattle, it’s more likely to become effective as a respiratory pathogen in humans."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_4", "statement": "It’s entirely possible that there have been a lot of human cases from cows and people are just getting it in a different way."}]}
{"id": "504", "fulltext": "The first calls that Dr. Barb Petersen received in early March were from dairy owners worried about crows, pigeons and other birds dying on their Texas farms. Then came word that barn cats—half of them on one farm—had died suddenly. Within days, the Amarillo veterinarian was hearing about sick cows with unusual symptoms: high fevers, reluctance to eat and much less milk. Tests for typical illnesses came back negative. Petersen, who monitors more than 40,000 cattle on a dozen farms in the Texas Panhandle, collected samples from cats and cows and sent them to Dr. Drew Magstadt, a friend from college who now works at the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University. The samples tested positive for a bird flu virus never before seen in cattle. It was the first proof that the bird flu, known as Type A H5N1, could infect cows. As of Wednesday, 36 U.S. herds had confirmed infections, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. \"It was just a surprise,\" recalled Petersen. \"It was just a little bit of disbelief.\" At the same time, on almost every farm with sick animals, Petersen said she saw sick people, too. \"We were actively checking on humans,\" Petersen said. \"I had people who never missed work, miss work.\" So far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday. Daskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals. Petersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu. Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said. His research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information. Without confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said. \"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray. Some of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said. Some farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines. Health officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and household members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who tested negative but were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral. Farmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen. \"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\" Russo called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk. \"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\" Gray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further. All labs that conduct tests must report positive results to the Agriculture Department. But many farmers may simply decide against testing, hoping to outlast the outbreak, he said. The reluctance of workers and farmers to allow testing is \"greatly hampering\" understanding of how the virus spreads, how large the outbreak is now and how quickly it may grow, Gray said. \"It's a negative, very negative, effect,\" he said. Petersen said she understands workers' and farmers' fears. She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean. \"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term. Your mind starts to go down that entire path of concern.\" ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

{"id": "525", "fulltext": "(CNN) — A US farmworker who caught bird flu after working with dairy cattle in Texas appears to be the first known case of mammal-to-human transmission of the virus, a new study shows. The dairy worker sought care in late March after developing painful red, swollen, weeping eyes with burst blood vessels. He had no fever, however, and his lungs were clear, according to a letter about the case that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday. He reported no contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but he did have repeated direct close contact with dairy cows in the same part of the state with other infected herds. Even though the man didn't become seriously ill, his case is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows. At the same time, it also leaves critical questions unanswered about a virus that the study authors said has \"pandemic potential,\" and it illustrates how hard it will be to track the infection in this vulnerable population of workers, where testing positive for an infectious disease might mean losing days of work and pay. \"For farmworkers specifically, certainly these are folks that are that are living in a state of economic desperation, and what they're not going to do is, they're not going to test for something if they don't have paid sick leave, because they cannot afford to be sent home and told to stay home and not work,\" said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers. Strater says UFW, like other groups, has heard rumors that there are dairy workers who are sick but don't want to be tested, but she said it's nothing that they're able to confirm. Health officials in Texas said they did test other sick dairy workers, including some with red eyes, but they turned out to have other illnesses, not bird flu. \"The people tested volunteered to be tested,\" said Lara Anton, senior press officer with the Texas Department of State Health Services. \"It's likely there were other people with symptoms who did not want to be tested so we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1. We can say for sure some of the people on dairy farms tested positive for other respiratory viruses that are commonly circulating in the human population,\" Anton said. In the case of the man who did test positive for bird flu, he took antiviral medications and recovered without any lasting problems, and his close family members received the drugs as a precaution, the letter says. Swabs of the patient's eyes and lungs revealed something interesting, too: His eyes were teeming with the H5N1 virus, but there was hardly any virus in his lungs. That could mean the worker was infected through his eyes — either by rubbing them with contaminated hands or through splashes of contaminated milk — rather than through his lungs, and the virus never migrated there, or that the virus couldn't get a foothold in his lungs because it was adapted primarily to infect birds, not cells in the human airway. The letter on the case was written by researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with doctors at the Texas Department of State Health Services and researchers at the Texas Tech Bioterrorism Response Laboratory. Health officials said they couldn't do further investigation of how the man was infected because \"epidemiological investigations were not able to be conducted at the farm\" where he worked. They were also unable to test other workers at the same farm. That kind of testing is critical to answer questions about how the worker became infected, whether others were being infected and if so, for how long they were infected and what kind of symptoms they had, if they had any at all. The CDC is looking for farms that will allow it to conduct such a detailed study. \"Understanding the current avian flu outbreak among dairy cattle is a vital priority to help protect human health,\" the agency said in a statement to CNN. \"Discussions are under way with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies. In the meantime, states continue to test symptomatic farm workers and monitor those who have been exposed to infected animals. CDC also continues to closely monitor a robust, nationwide flu surveillance system. To date, it has not detected any unusual flu activity.\" At a news briefing Friday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration was monitoring the situation \"very closely and taking this very seriously.\"", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "Even though the man didn't become seriously ill, his case is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows.

{"id": "530", "fulltext": "Officially, there is only one documented case of bird flu spilling over from cows into humans during the current U.S. outbreak. But epidemiologist Gregory Gray suspects the true number is higher, based on what he heard from veterinarians, farm owners and the workers themselves as the virus hit their herds in his state. 'We know that some of the workers sought medical care for influenza-like illness and conjunctivitis at the same time the H5N1 was ravaging the dairy farms,' says Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. 'I don't have a way to measure that, but it seems biologically quite plausible that they too, are suffering from the virus,' he says. Gray has spent decades studying respiratory infections in people who work with animals, including dairy cattle. He points out that 'clustering of flu-like illness and conjunctivitis' has been documented with previous outbreaks involving bird flu strains that are lethal for poultry like this current one. Luckily, genetic sequencing of the virus doesn't indicate it has evolved to easily spread among humans. Still, epidemiologists say it's critical to track any possible cases. They're concerned some human infections could be flying under the radar, especially if they are mild and transient as was seen in the Texas dairy worker who caught the virus. 'I think based on how many documented cases in cows there are, probably some decent human exposure is occurring,' says Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor of veterinary preventive medicine at The Ohio State University. 'We just don't really know.' Limited testing raises concerns There have been 36 herds affected in nine states. Local and state health departments have tested about 25 people for the virus and monitored over 100 for symptoms, federal health officials said at a briefing on Wednesday. These people are in 'the footprints of where the bovine detections are,' says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who's with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although he didn't provide details on the actual locations. 'There's a very low threshold for individuals to get tested,' he adds. The lack of testing early in the outbreak isn't necessarily surprising. In places like Texas and Kansas, veterinarians weren't thinking about bird flu when illnesses first cropped up in early March and it took time to identify the virus as the culprit. But the total number of tests done on humans at this point seems low to Jessica Leibler, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health. 'If the idea was to try to identify where there was spillover from these facilities to human populations, you'd want to try to test as many workers as possible,' says Leibler, who has studied the risk of novel zoonotic influenza and animal agriculture. Also, notes Gray, the virus is probably much more geographically widespread in cattle than the reported cases show, 'possibly spilling over much more to humans than we knew, or then we know.' The federal government has been quick to assess the safety of the dairy supply. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration released findings, showing that infectious virus wasn't present in about 200 samples collected from dairy products around the country. Initial results on ground meat are also reassuring. However, there still remain 'serious gaps' in public health officials' ability to detect bird flu among those who work with cows, a task made all the more difficult by the fact that some cases may not be symptomatic, says Leibler. 'There's really widespread opportunity for worker exposure to this virus.' Only complicating matters is the true scale of the outbreak in cattle remains murky, although new federal testing requirements for moving cattle between states may help fill out the picture. 'Some of the dairy herds seem to have clinically normal animals, but potentially infected and [that] makes it really hard to know where to do surveillance,' says Bowman. Calls for proactive steps to track down possible human cases The health care system would likely catch any alarming rise in human cases of bird flu, according to modeling done by the CDC. Federal health officials monitor influenza activity in emergency departments and hospitals. Hundreds of clinical laboratories that run tests are tasked with reporting findings. And in early April, a CDC health alert was sent to clinicians advising them to be on the lookout for anyone with flu-like symptoms or conjunctivitis who'd worked with livestock. But even these safeguards may not be sufficient to get ahead of an outbreak. 'I worry a bit that if we wait until we see a spike in those systems that perhaps we would already be seeing much more widespread community transmission,' says Dr. Mary-Margaret Fill, deputy state epidemiologist for the Tennessee Department of Health. Instead she says there should be proactive testing. Fill notes there are anecdotes about farmworkers with mild illness while working with cattle in some of the areas where the virus has spread and 'not enough visibility on the testing that's happening or not happening in those populations to understand what might be going on.' To get ahead of the virus, Leibler says not only do workers need to be screened but also their family members and others in the community, in the event that the virus does evolve to spread easily among humans. Dr. Rodney Young says doctors in the Texas panhandle have been vigilant about any cases of influenza, particularly among those who are around livestock, but so far there are no indications of anything out of the ordinary. 'We just haven't seen people who fit that description in order to suddenly be testing a lot more,' says Young, regional chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center School of Medicine in Amarillo. Getting buy-in from dairy farms Gray says it can be hard to detect and measure the illness in these rural workers for many reasons - their remote location, a reluctance to seek out health care, a lack of health insurance, concerns about immigration status, and a reticence among farmers 'to wave the flag' that there are infections. The farms he works with consider protecting workers and curbing the spread of this virus 'a huge priority,' but right now they bear all the risks of going public, he says. Dr. Fred Gingrich says this is a major barrier to closer cooperation between federal health officials and the industry during the current crisis. Dairy cattle farmers currently don't get compensated for reporting infections in their herds - unlike poultry farmers who receive indemnity payments for losses related to culling birds when they find cases, says Gingrich, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners. 'So what is their incentive to report?' he says, 'It's the same virus. It just doesn't kill our cows.' Gray has managed to start collecting samples from humans and cattle at several dairy farms that recently dealt with the virus. It's part of a study that he launched before the H5N1 outbreak in response to concerns about SARSCoV-2 spillover on farms. They'll look for evidence of exposure to novel influenza, including bird flu --something he's able to pull off because of his background in this area and his guarantee that the farms will be kept anonymous in the published work. What concerns him most is the possibility the outbreak could wind up at another kind of farm. 'We know when it hits the poultry farms because the birds die, but the pigs may or may not manifest severe illness,' he says, 'The virus can just churn, make many copies of itself and the probability of spilling over to those workers is much greater.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_2", "statement": "Gray points out that 'clustering of flu-like illness and conjunctivitis' has been documented with previous outbreaks involving bird flu strains that are lethal for poultry like this current one."}]}
{"id": "535", "fulltext": "Scientists worry that the H5N1 strain of avian influenza will become endemic in cattle, which would aid its spread in people. Concerns that pasteurized milk in the United States is teeming with H5N1 avian influenza virus are over. But there's no sign that the outbreak in cows is over, and scientists are increasingly concerned that cattle will become a permanent reservoir for this adaptable virus, giving it more chances to mutate and jump to humans. New data show that the virus can hop back and forth between cows and birds, a trait that could allow it to spread across wide geographical regions. Although the virus kills many types of mammal, most infected cows don't develop severe symptoms or die, meaning that no one knows whether an animal is infected without testing it. Moreover, a single cow can host several types of flu virus, which could, over time, swap genetic material to generate a strain that can more readily infect humans. Eventually the wrong combination of gene segments and mutations inevitably comes along, says Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Whatever opportunity we may have had to nip it in the bud we lost by a really slow detection. Viral expansion H5N1 isn't a new virus; various forms of it have been circulating since the 1990s. A particularly deadly variant that was first detected in 1996 has killed millions of birds and has been found in numerous mammalian species, including seals and mink. But until now, cows were not among the virus's known hosts. US officials first announced on 25 March that H5N1 had been found in cattle, and cows from 36 herds in 9 states have tested positive as of 7 May. Tests of pasteurized milk have found no living virus. But the virus's increasing ubiquity has made scientists uneasy. Every time it gets a new mammalian host species, like cows, there's more risk of human transmission and reduced human immunity, says Jessica Leibler, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University in Massachusetts. Bovine breakthrough Genomic data are starting to shed light on the origins of the cattle outbreak. In a 1 May preprint posted on bioRxiv, scientists at the US Department of Agriculture analysed more than 200 viral genomes taken from cows and found that the virus jumped from wild birds to cattle in late 2023. That result corroborates findings by Worobey and others in an analysis posted on the discussion forum virological.org on 3 May. (Neither article has yet been peer reviewed.) Want to prevent pandemics? Stop spillovers Because cows infected with H5N1 generally don't die of the flu, they are effective mixing vessels in which viruses can swap genetic material with other viruses, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. Even worse, the current strain seems to infect several species equally well. If you have a virus that's hopscotching back and forth between cows, humans and birds, that virus is going to have selective pressures to grow efficiently in all those species, she says. The larger the number of infected animals, Rasmussen says, the more chances the virus has to acquire helpful mutations, such as the ability to grow in the upper respiratory tract, which could make it more transmissible between people. Dangerous reservoir From a human perspective, Worobey says, cows might be one of the worst possible animal reservoirs for influenza because of their sheer number and the degree to which humans interact with them. Culling poultry has curbed previous bird flu outbreaks, but Rasmussen says that isn't a viable option for cattle. The animals are too valuable and, unlike birds, don't seem to die from the infection. H5N1 could even become endemic in cows, says Gregory Gray, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Other strains related to H5N1 are already endemic in chickens and pigs in some parts of the world. Flu on the farm Researchers aren't sure how the virus is spreading between herds. Wild birds, which congregate around cattle feed and defecate in the cows' water supply, are one probable source. Cattle are just one big birdfeeder, Gray says, adding that birds can spread infections much further than cows can and are much less controllable. Some evidence has suggested that farm equipment, such as milking machines, could be to blame, but several scientists worry that it could be airborne. I'm really thinking that's occurring and we've not been able to study it, Gray says, mainly because farmers have been reluctant to allow inspectors to test their cattle. Some related variants that infect horses have been found to spread through the air for kilometres, which could explain how the current strain has moved between dairy farms. Until more is known about the virus's transmission route, Worobey says, it's hard to determine the best way to contain it. Since late April, the US Department of Agriculture has required that cows are tested before being transported across state lines. That won't necessarily stop the virus's spread, but it could at least help researchers to understand where it's going. Herd immunity If the virus is airborne, Gray says, vaccinating cows might be an option. H5N1 vaccines have not yet been used in US cattle. But influenza vaccines have proved effective in pigs and poultry, and researchers are beginning to test them against the H5N1 strain infecting dairy herds. Data on how well the virus spreads between people are scarce. A study published on 3 May in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed that one dairy worker in Texas had been infected and that the worker experienced mild symptoms. But the people who worked and live with the infected person have not been tested. Still, US officials have not reported a large number of deaths or severe cases in humans, suggesting that the virus hasn't become highly transmissible or deadly, Worobey says. Below the radar But Gray says that there have been anecdotal reports of many more human cases. Leibler suspects that exposure of farm workers is widespread. When you see symptomatic patients, that's the tip of the iceberg, she says. In the worst-case scenario, she says, the virus would spread undetected in several species for a long time, accumulating mutations that prime it for causing a pandemic in the future. We have an awareness now from the COVID pandemic of how devastating that could be, she says. Leibler hopes that public-health efforts will begin testing workers and their families so that any transmission in humans will quickly be detected. H5N1 is with us, she says. It's not a virus that's going to disappear by any means. References 1. Burrough E. R. et al. Emerg. Infect. Dis https://doi.org/10.3201/eid3007.240508 (2024) 2. Nguyen, T.-Q. et al.

{"id": "541", "fulltext": "Twenty-seven years ago today, a 3-year-old boy in Hong Kong developed a sore throat, spiked a fever, and started to cough. Six days later, he was hospitalized; six days after that, he died of acute respiratory distress caused by viral pneumonia. Testing showed the toddler, who had contact with sick chickens before becoming ill, had been infected with H5N1 bird flu. His death was the first attributed to a bird flu virus, and since then, dozens more young children across a number of countries have died from this virus, H5N1. In fact, in the weeks that followed the boy's death, 17 other children in Hong Kong contracted the virus and five more died. It was a tragedy and a profound shock for the scientists who studied influenza. Until 1997, it was thought avian flu viruses didn’t infect people very often, and when they did, at most they caused exceedingly mild disease. That was what was seen when scientists experimentally infected human volunteers with three different bird flu viruses not H5N1 about 35 years ago. The Hong Kong outbreak was the first time the H5N1 virus pulled off the unexpected, rewriting the textbooks that sometimes over-confidently stated what the myriad versions of influenza A viruses found in wild birds and other species could and could not do. But it wouldn’t be the last time. In the nearly three decades since, flu scientists have tracked this virus with both vigilance and dread, watching it defy dogma again and again, learning through hard experience that it is a foe not to be underestimated. Related: Large amount of bird flu virus in milk suggests asymptomatic cows are infected with H5N1 Most scientists that STAT has spoken to since the H5N1 outbreak in cattle in the United States was confirmed are unsettled by the notion that the virus is spreading in mammals with which humans have close contact. “That’s a different ball game altogether,” said Malik Peiris, chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health. “That hadn’t happened in Asia all this time.” Nancy Cox, who for years headed the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said this particular lineage of H5N1, a descendent of a virus first spotted in a goose in China’s Guangdong province in 1996, is unlike any other family of flu viruses she recalls. “It seems that these viruses must have some kind of ‘special sauce’ that has allowed them to find ways to persistently spread, evolve, and cause what appear to be increasingly serious problems in both wildlife and domesticated animals,” Cox, who is now retired, told STAT in an email. “There is an element of unexpected robustness and malleability that has surprised even seasoned influenza watchers.” One such observer is Peiris, who has been closely tracking H5N1 since its first known foray into people. A few years later, in December 2002, he was planning to travel home to Sri Lanka for Christmas, as he did every year. Then wild water birds ducks, egrets, herons, and the like started dying in two waterfowl reserves in the city. The cause: H5N1. That too was startling. Wild birds had only been seen to be seriously sickened by bird flu viruses once before, in 1961. And ducks, the natural hosts of bird flu viruses, were thought to be more or less impervious to disease caused by them, said Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Flu viruses don’t attack the respiratory tracts of ducks and other wild water birds, as they do in people. In these birds, the viruses infect cells in the gut, passing through them before being excreted in their droppings. The birds don’t get visibly ill, the textbooks said. Until they did. “All these species, they were falling over dead,” Peiris said in a recent interview. “I missed Christmas. … I stayed in Hong Kong and was swabbing birds.” Related: As livestock move around the country, so does H5N1. The U.S. needs real-time tracking of livestock movements Necropsies the name for an animal autopsy showed a surprising pattern of disseminated disease atypical of previous observations of bird flu, and dramatically different from what is seen in human flu infection. This unusual finding of H5N1’s ability to spread outside the lungs, to organs like the liver and the brain, has been seen again and again over the intervening years in laboratory studies of Kuiken conducted in cats and necropsies of foxes, skunks, mink, and other mammals found to have died of H5N1 infection. It was also reported in a human case, a boy from Vietnam who died in 2004. In the spring of 2005, the phenomenon Peiris helped to record in the parks of Hong Kong happened on a much larger scale in a migratory bird reserve in Western China known as Qinghai Lake. Between April and June of that year, there was a large-scale die-off of wild birds there, again traced to H5N1. A little avian flu background is helpful here. Two groups of bird flu viruses those bearing H5 or H7 hemagglutinin proteins on their exteriors can transition from being of low pathogenicity to being highly pathogenic when the viruses spread in domestic poultry. (The term highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI, refers to how the virus behaves in poultry.) Seeing highly pathogenic, or high-path, viruses move back into wild birds in a big way raised serious concerns that wild birds could transmit the virus further and faster than was already occurring via the movement of infected poultry across Southeast Asia. “We published on it and we warned because this is a migrating center that this could be spreading far and wide,” Peiris said. Some scientists took a more sanguine view, spouting an aphorism that was heard often in 2005: Dead birds don’t fly. Apparently infected birds do, however. “Really, within a year it was in India and Egypt and Africa and Central Asia,” Peiris said. In the nearly two decades since the Qinghai Lake incident, H5N1 viruses have made their way around the globe, even to perhaps the most unlikely spot of all, Antarctica, infecting penguins and other wild birds there. Only Australia and New Zealand have yet to find H5N1 at this point. Another area in which H5 has rewritten the textbooks relates to what Cox referred to, the virus’ astonishing persistence. The former CDC flu director went back through influenza literature back to reports of “fowl plague,” as avian flu outbreaks in poultry used to be called in the 1800s and early 1900s, before influenza viruses were first identified to see how long outbreaks lasted. Related: WHO’s top scientist learned a hard lesson about H5N1 two decades ago: Stopping it takes more than biology Once high-path viruses emerged in poultry, the outbreaks they triggered tended to burn themselves out within a few years, especially when infected birds were culled to try to stop spread. But since reemerging in Hong Kong in late 2002, H5N1 has never really gone away. At some points it has been more headline grabbing than others with the recent discovery that it can infect cows, for instance. (“Who would have thought cows would get infected? And in this way?” Peiris exclaimed.) But it has never disappeared. “I’m not aware of another … avian flu virus that’s been circulating at this global scale for this long,” said Jeremy Farrar, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist. “That’s unprecedented.” Cox agreed. “While it wasn’t exactly scientific dogma that [high-path] avian viruses would eventually burn themselves out or fade away, it was clear from the history of past outbreaks that this is what happened for the majority of our well-documented outbreaks,” she said. Initially H5N1 was a problem in Southeast and then South Asia, later moving into the Nile River Delta of Egypt and Turkey, then into Europe. But for more than a decade, this highly problematic virus was not found in the Americas, which seemed to support another piece of flu dogma: Flu viruses found in birds that traveled in the migratory flyways that spanned Eurasia did not make their way to the flyways of the Americas. The oft-repeated claim was that the routes flown by migratory birds would keep H5 from crossing to the New World. “Pretty sure I might have said something similar,” admitted Richard Webby, director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals, at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Related: CDC’s top flu scientist says the risk to the public from H5N1 is low, but she isn’t sleeping well. Here’s why And then, that “never the twain shall meet” situation turned out to be wishful thinking. In late 2014 and early 2015, H5N2 and H5N8 viruses equally dangerous half siblings of H5N1 from Asia, bearing the same H5 hemagglutinin were found in poultry operations in multiple U.S. states. And then in late 2021, H5N1 itself was found in poultry and wild birds in Newfoundland, Canada’s easternmost province. So much for the non-intersection of the flyways. “By and large, that’s true the gene pools in migratory birds are distinct,” Peiris said. “But looking back, there were some clues of the mixture of viruses at the individual gene level, that reassortment was occasionally taking place.” (Reassortment is a process by which different flu viruses swap genes within a host, creating hybrids, like H5N2 or H5N8.) From eastern Canada, H5N1 has worked its way through the Americas, infecting two men in the United States, a young girl in Ecuador and a man in Chile in the past couple of years. It has also ignited large poultry outbreaks, and infected and killed an astonishing array of mammals seals and sea lions, various types of bears, coyotes, bobcats, mountain lions, raccoons, and otters among them. Some of these species have previously been seen to be susceptible to influenza, such as seals. But the scale of the toll the virus is taking on wildlife is unlike anything previously attributed to an influenza virus. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy It’s believed H5N1 may be spreading mammal to mammal in some of the marine species, though this is hard to prove, Kuiken said. It’s clear that it is moving cow-to-cow in the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak likely with human help. The dairy cow outbreak has uncovered a fact that had been seen before but not widely noted mammary glands are susceptible to flu viruses. The previous such observation occurred in relation to the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, when some infected women complained of mastitis. Canadian scientists infected ferret pups with H1N1 and allowed them to nurse; their mothers developed infection in their mammary glands. It is not knowable whether H5N1 will ever acquire the capacity to easily infect people and spread person-to-person in other words, trigger a pandemic. But ongoing transmission in a mammalian species gives the virus a chance to adapt to hosts that are far closer, genetically, to humans than are ducks or chickens. No one who has watched this virus thinks letting H5 get seeded into cow populations is a good idea. Adding to the complexity of this situation is that unlike its behavior in other species it infects, H5N1 isn’t making cows seriously ill. It makes the virus harder to track, and gives farmers less impetus to cooperate with authorities trying to determine how far the virus has spread. “The latest curveball with [high-path] H5 infection in dairy cattle is very concerning because there is little incentive to test dairy cows or their human contacts,” Cox said. “One can see so many potential problems on dairy farms. There are the asymptomatic infections in cows and perhaps people. There are the cows, the dogs, and the cats, and the other farm animals including perhaps pigs, the farm workers, and the family members and so on. It is going to be very challenging to get a clear picture of what is actually happening in anything like real time.” In the nearly three decades of human interaction with H5N1, the virus has taught us a lot about influenza viruses, consigning many things that were previously considered flu facts to the scientific trash bin. Kuiken said in the early 2000s he would give talks about H5N1 with the title “Breaking Rules.” He eventually stopped, he said, “because this lineage broke so many.” All those information resets should have taught us an important and overarching lesson, flu experts say. We should never assume we know everything this virus can do. “We absolutely should be hoping for the best, but planning for the possibility that this is going to be able to transmit human to human, and has the potential of becoming a pandemic virus,” said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Arizona who has been working with an international team of scientists to try to figure out when the cow outbreak started. “It’s much too early to sit back and say, ‘Well, it hasn’t happened yet, so it’s not going to happen.’”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_4", "statement": "We absolutely should be hoping for the best, but planning for the possibility that this is going to be able to transmit human to human, and has the potential of becoming a pandemic virus."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_6", "statement": "The latest curveball with [high-path] H5 infection in dairy cattle is very concerning because there is little incentive to test dairy cows or their human contacts."}]}

'The left-wing lunatics are trying very hard to bring back COVID lockdowns and mandates with all of their sudden fearmongering about the new variants that are coming,' Trump says in the video. 'Gee whiz, you know what else is coming? An election.' The post's caption reads, 'BREAKING: Donald Trump warns that the Democrats want to use bird flu to rig the 2024 elections, telling everyone, We will not comply.'

He is speaking about COVID-19, not bird flu, in the campaign video. The video is also not new or 'breaking,' as the post claims. It's from 2023. Post's caption doesn't match Trump's 2023 remarks The campaign video was originally posted to Trump's Truth Social account on Aug. 30, 2023. At no point in the video does Trump mention bird flu or warn that Democrats want to use the disease to fix the 2024 election, as the Threads post claims. Instead, he wrongly claims the 2020 election was 'rigged' and asserts his political opponents on the left are seizing upon new coronavirus variants to bring back lockdowns and increase the use of alternative voting methods such as mail-in ballots. 'They rigged the 2020 election, and now they're trying to do the same thing all over again by rigging the most important election in the history of our country—the 2024 election—even if it means trying to bring back COVID,' Trump says in the video. Fact check: False claim Trump said he wants 'iron dome' for defense against Canada The bird flu virus, also known as avian influenza H5N1, is widespread in wild birds around the world and has caused outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been two reported human cases in the U.S. since 2022, and the CDC reports the risk to public health is low.

{"id": "566", "fulltext": "Bird flu has come to roost in the concrete jungle. A highly pathogenic strain of avian flu has been circulating among New York City's feathered friends for years, a group of scientists say. And it means that pet owners should be on alert. The New York City Virus Hunters have found the avian flu in samples of bird poop that were collected between 2022 and 2023. The group published their findings in the Journal of Virology on Wednesday. The highly pathogenic avian flu (H5N1) has been found in some bird droppings in NYC. Getty Images Volunteers collected 1,927 samples of bird droppings scattered across green spaces throughout the city as well as some from animal rehabilitation centers. In total, the group identified six birds that contained the highly pathogenic avian flu (H5N1), including three Canadian geese, a red-tailed hawk, a peregrine falcon and a chicken. Although the number may seem small, bird flu can easily spread among animals. The virus has jumped to several dairy cattle herds, as well as other animals in the US, including foxes, raccoons, possums, bears and bobcats. And that means the dogs many New Yorkers take for walks on the street daily could also be at risk. 'It's smart to stay alert and stay away from wildlife,' Christine Marizzi, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told ScienceAlert. 'This also includes preventing your pets from getting in close contact with wildlife.' Researchers found a total of six infected birds, including three Canadian geese, a chicken, a falcon and a hawk. American Society for Microbiology The virus hunters are part of a community-based program that engages high school students in the first-ever citizen effort to map and track avian flu and avian paramyxoviruses that are circulating throughout New York City. (Paramyxoviruses include viruses like the measles, mumps and RSV.) The group received a $1.3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health late last year to expand their tracking efforts. Although transmission from bird to human is extremely low, scientists are concerned that in extremely populated areas, like New York City, the risk could be somewhat higher. To date, only two cases of highly pathogenic bird flu (H5N1) in humans have been detected, one in 2022 and one in April, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both of these cases have been in individuals who came into close contact with infected livestock. No known cases of human-to-human transmission have occurred. Although the findings are not cause for alarm, researchers say it's important to keep your pets away from birds. Getty Images Although the cause for alarm remains low, experts say that NYC poses a unique risk: It's a densely populated area and it's right in the flight path of many migratory birds. 'This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets, providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases,' Marizzi explained. The findings suggest that avian flu has actually been present in NYC for a while, and no human cases have ever been confirmed. The findings, which included samples collected between 2022 and 2023, suggest that the bird flu has actually been present in NYC for quite some time. AFP via Getty Images Nevertheless, the World Health Organization has stated that the current strain of bird flu is of 'great concern' and other experts have warned that we're making all the same mistakes that were made in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Remnants of the virus have been found in commercial milk, but because pasteurization kills the virus, this poses no risk to consumers, experts have said. 'Birds are key to finding out which influenza and other avian viruses are circulating in the New York City area, as well as important for understanding which ones can be dangerous to both other birds and humans,' Marizzi explained.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_2", "statement": "The World Health Organization has stated that the current strain of bird flu is of 'great concern' and other experts have warned that we're making all the same mistakes that were made in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_3", "statement": "This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets, providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_4", "statement": "Birds are key to finding out which influenza and other avian viruses are circulating in the New York City area, as well as important for understanding which ones can be dangerous to both other birds and humans."}]}
{"id": "572", "fulltext": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked local and state health officials Tuesday to maintain flu surveillance operations at peak-season levels over the summer in a bid to remain watchful for any signs of human-to-human spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus. Flu surveillance activity is generally conducted at low levels during the late spring and summer months, in recognition of the fact that as temperatures rise, transmission of seasonal flu viruses drops to minimal levels in the Northern Hemisphere. But in a call with state and local health authorities, Nirav Shah, CDC's principal deputy director, said flu surveillance efforts should not be allowed to go into off-season mode this summer, given the need to detect human infections with H5N1, if they are occurring. \"The bottom line is that in light of the ongoing outbreak of H5 among domestic dairy cattle, we want to maximize our chances of spotting a case of novel influenza in the community and minimize the risk that a case of H5N1 would go undetected in the community,\" Shah told STAT in an interview after his call with leaders of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the Association of Public Health Laboratories, the Big Cities Health Coalition, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of County and City Health Officials. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy Shah asked jurisdictions to increase the number of positive influenza virus samples that they submit to public health laboratories for subtyping, a form of testing that detects the precise type of influenza virus a positive specimen contains. \"We say we don't believe that there are cases of H5 novel influenza circulating because we haven't seen any evidence that would be suggestive of that. But until and unless we enhance our subtyping, we are basing that conclusion on negative implication rather than on affirmative data,\" Shah said in the interview. He estimated that over the summer, roughly about 600 to 700 positive samples a week that could be subtyped will be collected nationally. In the meeting with the representatives of the state and local health agencies and the testing labs, none raised concerns about having to do the extra work, Shah said. The outbreak, the first time H5N1 has been seen to transmit in dairy cattle, has been detected in 51 herds in nine states over the past two months. Scientists studying the phenomenon believe the virus is much more widespread. But reluctance on the part of farmers to cooperate with investigations has stymied efforts to gauge how far the virus has spread and how many people may have been infected. To date only one human infection has been detected, in a man who worked on a Texas dairy farm. The man developed conjunctivitis, the only discernible sign that he had been infected. H5N1 is a virus that originated in wild ducks. But over the last 27 years, it has spread widely across the globe, killing hundreds of millions of poultry and a variety of mammalian species, including seals, bears, raccoons, and cats, both large and domestic. Until now, it has not been seen in cows. While it is not killing cattle, the virus' presence in a species with which people have regular contact is concerning, because it gives the virus more opportunities to evolve to be better at mammal-to-mammal spread, potentially even human-to-human spread. If it acquires that capacity, it could trigger a pandemic. In addition to maintaining flu surveillance systems throughout the summer, the CDC and others are using detection of influenza A viruses in wastewater to try to look for places where the H5N1 virus might be spreading. H5N1 is an influenza A virus; so too are the H3N2 and H1N1 viruses that circulate during flu season. But because the latter two typically circulate at very low levels during the summer, it's thought that detecting flu A in wastewater could signal presence of H5N1 in a community whether that's in wild birds, cows, milk disposed of by an affected farm, or people.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "The bottom line is that in light of the ongoing outbreak of H5 among domestic dairy cattle, we want to maximize our chances of spotting a case of novel influenza in the community and minimize the risk that a case of H5N1 would go undetected in the community."}]}

We're now the Health Brief, but you'll still get the same reporting and analysis you've come to expect. Good morning. I'm Elisabeth Rosenthal, senior contributing editor for KFF Health News and a former reporter for the New York Times in Beijing. In 1997, I was on a New Year's holiday in Hong Kong with my mom and two young children when I got a call from the foreign desk: Could I report on a novel virus killing chickens in huge numbers? Send tips to erosenthal@kff.org. Today's edition: A landmark law that significantly expanded health care and disability benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances hits a new milestone. Two House Republican leaders are seeking a study of the budgetary impacts of making enhanced Obamacare subsidies permanent. But first — Bird flu: One reporter's up-close perspective The H5N1 flu virus and I go way back. In 1997, I watched as more than a million chickens were slaughtered in Hong Kong to combat the first major global outbreak of the disease. Eighteen people were sickened by the virus and six died, all of whom had close contact with the birds. They were the first deaths in humans. Though officials in Hong Kong and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were pretty sure H5N1 was unlikely to spread from person to person (and still are), there were mysteries surrounding this flu strain that had suddenly acquired the ability to infect people. Among them: Some workers in Hong Kong's poultry markets had antibodies to the virus but didn't fall ill. It fell off my radar until late 2005, when birds started dying in biblical numbers in remote eastern Turkey, where residents live in proximity to their animals. When bird flu is detected in an area, best practice is to promptly kill all domesticated fowl to prevent spread of the disease. The government was slow to react and farmers in the area only reluctantly culled their birds, often their main source of income. More than a dozen people were sickened and about a third died, including three of Zeki and Marifet Kocyigit's four children. I visited the family in their simple cement home during a frigid January and asked if the children had had contact with the birds. \"Of course my children played with our chickens; they are children,\" he said. Shortly thereafter birds started dying of H5N1 in Greece and Nigeria. It was popping up all over Europe and Africa. Scientists determined that the virus was spreading from wild birds landing among domesticated flocks, making it hard to control by culls. As wild fowl continued to threaten outbreaks in Europe, several countries mandated that chickens be kept indoors if dead wild birds were found in an area. In 2015, a variant of the H5N1 virus came to the United States, sparking outbreaks and culls on Midwest farms — though no human deaths. Last year it turned up in harbor seals. \"This has been a 20-year process,\" said Peter Hotez, an infectious-disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine. \"The first red flag was birds dropping from the sky. The second was harbor seals. The third is, now, cattle.\" Cows in at least 51 dairy cattle herds in nine states have tested positive for the flu, though the full extent of the U.S. outbreak is unclear in part due to reluctance by farmers and farmworkers to cooperate with health officials. One human case has been reported — a dairy worker who suffered conjunctivitis. There are important differences between the Hong Kong outbreak of more than 25 years ago and the current U.S. outbreak. H5N1 today is better understood; health authorities say that in the event of more human cases it should respond to antivirals like Tamiflu, and the CDC says the United States could produce and ship 100 million doses of a vaccine — already developed — within months. But experts like Hotez still worry. \"Surveillance testing has been very fragmented — I don't think cattle was on anyone's radar.\" He likens the virus's appearance in herds to a modest earthquake in San Francisco: \"You know something bigger is likely coming, but you don't know if it'll be one year or 100.\" KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism. White House prescriptions 1 million Pact Act claims granted On tap today: President Biden will gather with veterans and their families in New Hampshire to announce that the federal government has granted 1 million claims under the Pact Act since the bipartisan legislation was signed into law in August 2022. The milestone means more than 888,000 veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service are receiving new health-care and disability benefits, totaling over $5.7 billion, according to the White House. Texas, Florida and North Carolina lead in the number of claims granted under the landmark law. The approval rate for claims is around 75 percent. Common conditions include allergic bronchial asthma, hypertension, respiratory issues and certain cancers, according to administration officials. Agency alert ARPA-H takes on cybersecurity in health care The Biden administration is funneling more than $50 million into a new initiative aimed at strengthening the cybersecurity defenses of the nation's health-care sector. Unveiled yesterday by the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, the program will provide \"multiple awards\" to organizations with the best proposals for developing tools to detect and automatically address vulnerabilities in hospital software. Why it matters: The effort follows February's cyberattack on a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary that triggered a national health payment crisis. This month, a major attack on Ascension, one of the country's largest health systems, knocked patient record systems offline and forced medical staff to log care on paper. In other news from the agencies — Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit, is suing the Food and Drug Administration for allegedly failing to address a six-year-old petition urging the agency to update the product labels of two classes of common antidepressant treatments with a warning about the potential for long-term sexual side effects. Pharmaceutical giant GSK has been accused of defrauding Medicaid, Medicare and other health programs by allegedly hiding cancer risks associated with its heartburn drug Zantac, according to a whistleblower complaint filed yesterday by an independent Connecticut laboratory. On the Hill House GOP chairs seek study of permanent premium tax credits House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason T. Smith (R-Mo.) and House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Tex.) are seeking a comprehensive analysis of the budgetary impact of making enhanced Obamacare subsidies permanent. In a letter sent yesterday to Congressional Budget Office Director Phillip Swagel and Joint Committee on Taxation Chief of Staff Thomas Barthold, the lawmakers expressed concerns about the costs associated with the beefed-up tax credits and whether they could be contributing to inflated health insurance premiums. A spokesperson for the CBO confirmed that the agency received the letter and said it would respond to the lawmakers directly. The bigger picture: Making permanent the premium tax credits that help low- and middle-income Americans purchase health insurance was a top priority in Biden's fiscal 2025 budget, as they are slated to expire next year without congressional action. Reproductive wars Abortion rights amendment moves a step closer to the Nevada ballot Reproductive rights advocates in Nevada announced yesterday that they submitted nearly double the required number of signatures to place a proposed amendment enshrining abortion access in the state constitution before voters in November. State officials have until July 8 to verify the signatures for the proposed amendment to be included on the ballot. A closer look: While abortion is currently legal up to the 24th week of pregnancy in Nevada, advocates aim to safeguard access by proposing a constitutional amendment that protects abortion rights until fetal viability, fearing potential future restrictions.

{"id": "579", "fulltext": "(CNN) - A case of H5 influenza, also known as avian influenza or bird flu, has been reported in a farm worker in Michigan who had regular exposure to infected livestock, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's the second case reported as part of an ongoing outbreak of the virus in birds and cattle across the country and the third bird flu case ever reported in a person in the US. However, health officials emphasized Wednesday that the risk to the general public remains low. The person was being monitored for the virus because of their exposure to infected cattle, the CDC said in a news release Wednesday. A nasal swab tested negative for influenza at the state health department and later at the CDC, but an eye swab tested positive. The person reported only eye symptoms, and they have recovered. Eye symptoms such as redness, swelling and watering were also the only ones reported in the previous human case in this outbreak, in a dairy farm worker in Texas. That man took antiviral medications and recovered with no lasting problems. \"It is not unexpected that comprehensive testing identified a human infection,\" the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release Wednesday. \"Information to date suggests this is a sporadic infection, with no associated ongoing spread person-to-person.\" The Michigan farm worker was one of about 170 people enrolled in an active monitoring program in which they received a text message from the state health department each day that asks about potential symptoms. When the person indicated the presence of symptoms, public health workers took samples, offered antiviral medications to them and their close contacts, and urged them to isolate. The CDC received the samples on Tuesday and reported the test results to Michigan health officials that night, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC. \"This case was not unexpected,\" Shah said Wednesday, emphasizing the agency's ongoing efforts to help farms prepare for the spread of the virus. \"It does not change our assessment of the risk overall. What it does do, however, is it reinforces the message that CDC has been putting out since late March, which is that entities involved with this - be they local health departments, farms, farm workers and farm worker organizations - ought to be alert but not alarmed by these developments. We have not seen evidence of other cases in this area or elsewhere in any of our monitoring systems, let alone any evidence of human-to-human transmission,\" he said. \"And this is reassuring, but the work of public health is not done. In the coming days, we'll have additional information on the genomic sequence or the DNA fingerprint of this particular virus. And we'll be able to compare it to the virus from infected cows in Michigan, as well as to compare it to the virus from the earlier human case in Texas.\" The fact that the nasal specimen tested negative while the eye swab was positive is also, \"in a sense, reassuring,\" Shah said, as it indicates a reduced likelihood that the virus is spreading through respiration. Although remnants of the virus have been found in samples of dairy products purchased from grocery stores, the US Food and Drug Administration \"continues to affirm our assessment of the safety of the commercial milk supply,\" Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said Wednesday. \"To date, the totality of the evidence - including studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization against multiple pathogens, recent studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization of [highly pathogenic avian influenza] and eggs at lower temperatures than generally used in dairy products, and negative retail sample results to date - continue to indicate the commercial milk supply is safe. We also continue to strongly advise against the consumption of raw milk\" or milk that has not been pasteurized. Testing with a substitute virus in ground beef found some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, but it was present at \"much, much reduced levels,\" according to Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the US Department of Agriculture, and it's not clear whether it would be enough to make someone sick.

But deciding when to start producing H5 vaccine at scale, in the quantities needed to vaccinate the world, is no easy feat. It’s a high-cost, high-risk endeavor. Get it right and you save lives. Hesitate, and lives will be lost. But making the call if the vaccine turns out not to be needed is not a cost-free decision either. There are some obvious questions that come to mind when you start thinking about what might trigger mass production of H5N1 vaccine. Here are a few, and some things to think about to help make sense of a truly complicated situation. Given the concern about H5N1 in dairy cattle, why not just start making H5N1 vax now, in case we need it? The global capacity to make flu vaccine is in the range of about 1.2 billion trivalent (three components in one) doses of vaccine a year, according to a market assessment the World Health Organization published in January. Most of the year, that production capacity is in use doing what it was built to do, making seasonal flu vaccine for the Northern and Southern hemisphere flu seasons. In the weeks between those two runs, plant maintenance is typically done. Related: CDC asks states and cities to keep flu surveillance at peak levels because of bird flu threat In a flu pandemic, the output of all those production lines would shift to making pandemic vaccine to protect against the new strain of flu that would likely be triggering large waves of illness worldwide. Here’s the thing. The production lines can make seasonal flu vaccine. Or they can make pandemic flu vaccine. They cannot make both at the same time. That’s why deciding to make pandemic flu vaccine at scale is not a no-cost decision. “You can’t just press the button and begin producing pandemic H5 vaccines. You have to stop producing your seasonal vaccine, and all of you out there know how lifesaving that vaccine is,” Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s health emergencies program, told reporters at a press conference earlier this month. “So, this requires a very careful consideration.” When decisions like these have to be made, it’s not clear how things are going to play out. A new virus might cause a devastating pandemic. Or, as was the case in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it might trigger an event that is so mild that politicians will later question whether an emergency response was needed. (In a recent interview, Tom Frieden, who was director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the H1N1 pandemic, called it “a pimple of a pandemic.”) In 2009, the world didn’t really have to make a tough decision about whether to stop seasonal flu vaccine production, said Marie-Paule Kieny, who was WHO’s assistant director-general for health systems and innovation at the time. (Kieny has since retired from the global health agency.) That’s because production of the seasonal vaccine for the 2009-2010 Northern Hemisphere winter was almost completed when it became clear the new virus had triggered a pandemic. But another time, a decision might have to be taken to abort the seasonal flu vaccine effort to switch to pandemic vaccine a decision that would be costly for producers. In most cases, manufacturers only get paid for vaccines they deliver, and if they have to junk a run of seasonal flu vaccine because the client decides it wants pandemic, not seasonal flu vaccine, they have to absorb those costs, said Paula Barbosa, associate director for vaccine policy for the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). Sure, they’d probably end up selling all the pandemic vaccine doses they could make, as quickly as they could make them. But the costs associated with the abandoned run would eat into those profits. Related: Move over, wastewater. Store-bought milk could be another way to track the bird flu outbreak in cows “Individual companies might have specific agreements with certain countries, but overall, what is lost, it’s on the manufacturers,” Barbosa said. There can be opportunity costs as well. At a point during the Covid-19 pandemic, when global vaccine production was operating at full steam, there was a global shortage of glass for vaccine vials. Everything used in vaccine production the eggs viruses are grown in for most of the traditional flu vaccine manufacturing, the equipment needed to administer vaccines would likely be in short supply in a serious pandemic. Using any of this stuff to make or administer seasonal vaccine when pandemic vaccine is needed would be a wasted opportunity. “You have to be totally conscious that, especially when you get to a global scale, it’s syringes, it’s needles, vials. It’s the capacity to fill and finish the vaccine. We don’t have that at global scale and most of it, like the antigen, or much of it is concentrated in better-off countries. So yeah, there is a huge supply chain and logistics challenge if we have a global pandemic,” said Jesse Goodman, who was director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research during the 2009 pandemic. Goodman is now director of the Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship at Georgetown University. Barbosa pointed out another cost of switching into pandemic vaccine production mode. Big manufacturers, like Sanofi and CSL Seqirus, run their flu vaccine production facilities year round, serving clients in both hemispheres. But some smaller companies that make flu vaccine for local markets make it half the year and produce pediatric vaccines the rest of the time. Switching to pandemic flu vaccine production could mean essential childhood vaccines aren’t available for some period of time, Barbosa said. “We really need a process to altogether take that decision and then for there to be a full understanding of what are the consequences, not only for manufacturers, but for worldwide vaccine production,” she said. Is there a process? Is it clear how a decision to make H5N1 vaccine will be made? “Nothing is clear,” said Kieny. After the 2009 pandemic, the WHO held a series of three meetings with industry, regulators, and national authorities to try to figure out whether a framework for making a switch from seasonal to pandemic production could be devised. Industry very much wanted to know they would be issued marching orders. They still do. “Manufacturers themselves cannot be responsible for this decision,” Barbosa said. Related: H5N1 doesn’t have to be a repeat of Covid-19’s ‘public health versus the economy’ “Right now there is no formal process to tell all manufacturers to switch from seasonal vaccine production to pandemic production. Industry does need a clear signal to do that switch even fully or partially,” she said. “WHO declaring a pandemic is helpful. But it might not be enough. For instance, if it’s a pandemic, and the pandemic virus causes milder disease … there may not be a need to manufacture a pandemic vaccine at all.” The WHO-led consultations, which were held from 2013 through 2017, did not result in a firm plan for how to do this. It wasn’t clear that anyone wanted to own this decision-making responsibility, Kieny said “at least until the situation gets really bad.” Gary Grohmann, who used to be the head of immunobiology for Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration its FDA-equivalent was involved in those meetings. He suggested individual countries will give manufacturers they purchase from directions, based on the best advice available from their public health agencies, and from the WHO. When it perceives there is a need, the latter will make a recommendation that pandemic flu vaccine production begin, Grohmann said. “That will be only a recommendation. And it would be up to the individual countries to make the decision and then ask their manufacturers … to make their vaccines and to stop production, possibly, of other vaccines,” he said. Major manufacturers, though, sell to multiple clients. What if the country in which the plant is housed wants to start pandemic vaccine production, but another important client wants to proceed with seasonal production, in case the pandemic doesn’t take off? Kieny believes some big national governments may get the ball rolling when they decide it’s time to buy pandemic vaccine. “It depends when the big customers, and especially the U.S., will say, ‘We think that it’s worth putting the money on the table.’ Then everyone will rush and do the same,” she said. “It’s not a question of a switch. It’s a question of a decision. And it’s a financial decision to invest.” That could be particularly true in the wake of the Covid pandemic, when messenger RNA vaccines made their global debut, especially if a flu pandemic were to happen in the near term. A number of the mRNA manufacturers, Pfizer and Moderna among them, have been working on, but have not yet licensed, seasonal flu vaccines. Without a seasonal product line to disrupt, it would be easier for those players to make pandemic vaccine should they choose to enter the market. But there would need to be the promise of sales. Related: USDA, FDA turf battles hamper responses to outbreaks like H5N1 bird flu “For vaccine lines that aren’t used for flu now, the decision isn’t to switch, it’s whether to invest and when to start producing,” Kieny said. Wenqing Zhang, head of the WHO’s global influenza program, said after its 2017 consultation with stakeholders, the WHO revisited the whole question of how pandemic influenza vaccine production would be triggered, eventually coming up with a document called the Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Response-Operational Framework. The document, finalized in 2022, has not been published, she said, because some items in it touch on issues that are up for negotiation in the ongoing efforts to update the International Health Regulations. Zhang said the document, which is not available online, acknowledges that manufacturers would need a signal from the WHO that a pandemic may be underway. But the WHO declaration would be about the risk that the virus poses, she said. Whether the document will be published as is or will require revisions will depend on the outcome of the IHR negotiations. So watch this space. Flu vaccine manufacturers just took a component out of the seasonal vaccine, the influenza B/Yamagata virus that disappeared during the Covid-19 pandemic. Why not use that space in the seasonal shot to start protecting people against H5N1? Goodman actually advocates something similar: He’d like to see H5N1 vaccine made in a monovalent shot in other words, not combined with vaccines targeting seasonal flu viruses that people could opt to get if they wanted to start protecting themselves against this virus. He proposed it in an article in Clinical Infectious Diseases in 2016. Rather than stockpile vaccine against H5, stockpile immunity in people, he argues. “Even if this particular threat” the H5N1 outbreak in cows “doesn’t turn into a pandemic, I do think it should give further impetus to really thinking about doing that,” he told STAT. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy But the idea of bundling H5N1 vaccine into the seasonal flu shot would cause regulatory challenges. The virus is not very immunogenic, meaning it doesn’t trigger a strong immune response in people. Research done nearly 20 years ago showed that in order to achieve what would probably be a protective response, the vaccine would need to be given in two massive doses; later research showed two regular sized doses with an adjuvant, a compound that boosts the immune response a vaccine generates, would likely provide protection. Most seasonal flu shots do not contain an adjuvant the sole exception is a vaccine for seniors sold by Seqirus, which contains the company’s MF-59 adjuvant. Adding an adjuvant to the seasonal shots would change the vaccines enough that new licenses might be needed a big lift for manufacturers. In addition, studies would be needed to make sure that the H5N1 component did not erode the immune response to the other components of the vaccines. Zhang said that before H5N1 or another potential pandemic vaccine could be used in this way there would need to be more research. There’s no data, she noted, on what happens after repeated vaccination against H5N1. And it’s not clear when would be the best time to give it, because immunity induced by vaccination will wane over time. “All these, I think, are research questions that need to be addressed,” she said. If vaccinating people is such a tough call to make, why not just vaccinate the cows? This may turn out to be something that happens, but it’s still very early days. Some makers of animal vaccines are reportedly working on developing H5N1 vaccines for cows. But there are still a lot of questions that need answering before farmers are likely to embrace this approach, said Meghan Davis, a dairy and mixed animal veterinarian who does “One Health” research in Johns Hopkins University’s department of environmental health and engineering and school of medicine. (One Health is a term that refers to the intersection of human and animal health.) “I think we do not have enough information right now to address the really pragmatic questions that dairy producers are going to have, if they’re going to spend money for this,” Davis told STAT. Farmers will want to know who is going to pay for a vaccine that they may be mainly using to lower the risk that H5N1 will spill over from cows to people. Though animal vaccines can be much less expensive than the human equivalents, the price of the serum itself is not the only cost of an immunization program. If a vaccine has to be administered by a veterinarian, that adds to the cost. If it has to be given more than once, the cost goes up. Will all cows need it, or could you target only lactating cattle? How long will the immunity the vaccine induces last? “Without the answers to those questions, you really can’t think about your cost benefit at all,” she said. But Davis said farmers may see advantages of vaccination. The impact of H5N1 in cows is still coming into view because farmers have been pretty close-mouthed about what they are experiencing when the virus moves into a herd. However, word is starting to emerge that some of the affected cows do not return to pre-infection milk production levels, that when they recover from the infection some experience a “deficit,” Davis said. “Now you’ve got a cow who’s not going to produce as much as she would have produced at that point in her lactation.” In such cases, farmers may decide to send cows like these to slaughter earlier than otherwise would have been the case, getting fewer years of production out of these animals. If a vaccine prevented infection and protected against a drop in production, that might change the economics of the approach, she said. Another issue related to vaccination of animals against H5N1 relates to international trade. Though the World Organization for Animal Health the animal equivalent of the World Health Organization recommends against it, some countries restrict imports of poultry that have been vaccinated against avian influenza strains, because testing can’t easily differentiate between antibodies that are the result of previous infection or vaccination. Davis said this may be less of an issue for dairy cattle, as milk sales are more local and regional than international, but she noted it might be an issue for cheeses.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_4", "statement": "There is a huge supply chain and logistics challenge if we have a global pandemic."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_5", "statement": "H5N1 doesn’t have to be a repeat of Covid-19’s ‘public health versus the economy’."}]}
{"id": "581", "fulltext": "A second human case of H5N1 bird flu infection linked to the current outbreak in dairy cows has been detected, in a farm worker who had exposure to infected cows, Michigan state health authorities announced on Wednesday. In a statement, health officials said the individual had mild symptoms and has recovered. Evidence to date suggests this is a sporadic infection, with no signs of ongoing spread, the statement said. 'Farmworkers who have been exposed to impacted animals have been asked to report even mild symptoms, and testing for the virus has been made available,' Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, said in the statement. 'The current health risk to the general public remains low,' she added. 'This virus is being closely monitored, and we have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission at this point. This is exactly how public health is meant to work, in early detection and monitoring of new and emerging illnesses.' NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy This is only the third human case ever of H5N1 reported in the United States. A man in Texas who worked on a dairy farm was infected there earlier in this outbreak. The country's first case, in the spring of 2022, was in a man in Colorado who was involved in culling H5N1-infected birds in a poultry outbreak there. ADVERTISEMENT The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a nasal swab taken from the Michigan farm worker was negative for flu. But a swab of the person's eye was sent to the CDC, where it tested positive for H5 flu virus, though final confirmation that it's the H5N1 subtype is pending genetic sequencing. This was the only symptom the individual had, the CDC said. In the Texas case in late March, the only symptom reported was conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye. 'We found this case because we were looking for this case. And we were looking for it because we were prepared. And in particular, the state of Michigan was prepared,' CDC's Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah said during a press conference organized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University's School of Public Health, said she wished other states were looking for H5N1 cases as aggressively as Michigan is. 'If there's any takeaway from this finding it's that this is probably the tip of the iceberg because this is the one state that we know of that has done the most in terms of testing on farms of both cows and also monitoring workers that are on the farms where they found cattle infections,' she told STAT. Nuzzo said she took no comfort from the fact that only two human cases have been detected so far in this outbreak, and worries that people may be reading too much into that low number. 'The absence of finding cases is being interpreted as reassuring, that this [outbreak] is perhaps something that is abating,' she said. 'And I have absolutely no ability to tell you that's happening, in part because I think the testing that we're doing could very well be qualitatively ... misleading.' During the press conference, Dawn O'Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS, revealed that 4.8 million doses of H5N1 vaccine that has been stockpiled in bulk is in the process of being put into vials a process called fill and finish. This is a little less than half of the vaccine believed to be effective against the current strain of H5N1 that is stored in the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile. O'Connell said the decision to make the vaccine more readily deployable was taken a couple of weeks ago. 'It takes a couple of months to be able to fill and finish vaccine doses... so I thought it made sense, given what we were seeing,' she said. O'Connell said a decision to use the vaccine has not been made. To date, nearly 900 people in 24 countries have been confirmed to have been infected with H5N1 since 2003, with most cases tied to exposure to infected poultry. On rare occasions, there have been small clusters of cases that raised questions about whether limited person-to-person spread has occurred something that is hard to prove when multiple people have the same exposures to infected animals. Ongoing spread among people has not been detected, and it is believed the virus would need to evolve further to gain the ability to spread easily to and among people. The outbreak in cattle, the first known to have occurred with this virus, was confirmed in late March, though evidence suggests that it had been underway for several months before testing revealed the cause of a drop in milk production among cows. Since then the U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed outbreaks in 52 herds in nine states, including Michigan, which has reported 19 infected herds more than any other state. (The USDA's most recent tally does not include four that Michigan reported since May 17.) Experts following the outbreak believe the national count of affected herds significantly underestimates the scope of the problem. Both the USDA and the CDC have admitted that farmers have been reluctant to allow testing of their cows or their workers, afraid of the stigma attached to being associated with the outbreak. But that has been less true in Michigan, where state officials have taken a uniquely aggressive stance in its public health response, informed, in part, by the devastating impacts H5N1 has had on the state's poultry flocks in the past few years. On May 1, Tim Boring, director of the state's Department of Agriculture, declared an 'extraordinary animal health emergency,' signing an order requiring Michigan farmers to step up their biosecurity measures. 'Most farms have been good cooperators with that,' Boring told STAT in an interview last week. Related: When should we start making H5N1 vaccine, and who will make that decision? In short, it's complicated Farmers have also been open to working with local health authorities to fill out questionnaires that could help investigators track how the virus is moving between dairy herds throughout the state. 'Hundreds and hundreds of farm workers here in Michigan have been interviewed,' Boring said. 'They understand the importance of understanding how this is moving around so we can limit the spread of this.' Local health authorities have also been monitoring workers from farms with infected herds for symptoms either through regular phone calls with farm supervisors or automated text messages that ask if they've been experiencing conjunctivitis or any flu-like symptoms, even mild ones. Testing is being offered to any symptomatic workers who've been exposed to animals on affected farms or are living in congregate settings with people who've been exposed. In an interview Wednesday afternoon, Bagdasarian, the Michigan health official, described the discovery of a human case as a sign these efforts to find new infections are paying off. 'Michigan has really been one of the states leading in terms of testing, so it's not surprising that we have picked up on this sporadic case,' she said. At least 35 people have been tested so far, she said. This case is the first to have come back positive. Bagdasarian said officials have seen no evidence of secondary infections. But the state is not yet conducting serological surveys looking for antibodies to H5N1 in the blood of farm workers and those they've been in contact with to determine if there have been unreported cases, and possibly even spread from those individuals to others. 'We've always talked about the need to do additional studies to do additional engagement, and to do a big look at serology, especially for people who may have remained asymptomatic throughout,' Bagdasarian said. 'That would be a next step.' Shah said the CDC would very much like to conduct serology studies among dairy farm workers, including those, like the Michigan individual, who test positive. 'At this time, we're not there yet,' he said. Eric Deeble, the USDA's acting senior advisor for H5N1, announced during the news conference that additional financial incentives are being planned to try to entice dairy farmers to report infections in their herds and take steps to reduce the risks to cows and workers on the farms. Compensation for lost milk a substantial drop in milk production is the most notable sign of infection in a herd is planned, but will take a few more weeks to finalize, he said.

{"id": "592", "fulltext": "With second human case of H5N1 reported, CDC launches dashboard to monitor wastewater, and recruits students to help Amid widespread gaps in US testing for H5N1, a type of bird flu, and as a second case among humans has been detected, scientists are turning to more creative ways of monitoring the outbreak—especially in human and animal feces. Scientists and officials are expanding wastewater monitoring across the US and engaging community members to collect waste samples from birds. They hope to keep tabs on this outbreak while preparing for the next pandemic. A new dashboard to monitor influenza A in wastewater across the country was launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week. It doesn’t track H5N1 specifically, but the highly pathogenic avian influenza variant is part of the flu A family. The dashboard helps identify hotspots in the US where flu A is surging—and, since flu rates among people are low this time of year, such a surge can alert scientists and the public to potential outbreaks of H5N1. “I’m really pleased to see that they’re sharing the data that they have,” said Marc Johnson, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Medicine and the lab lead for wastewater surveillance in Missouri. Another project turns to citizen scientists—high school students in New York City—to sample bird droppings for infectious diseases. Volunteers, swathed in personal protective gear, are trained in taking fecal samples from local parks, and then they work with scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai to analyze which pathogens are present. This is how H5N1 was first discovered in New York City in late 2022, according to a new study. “There is a lot of potential for citizen science, particularly to increase the scope of surveillance of pathogens,” said Philip Meade, lead author of that study and a researcher at the Mount Sinai lab. “It is very difficult to have a total understanding of the viruses that are circulating in our environment,” he said. The citizen science program, called Virus Hunters, could be expanded to other migratory bird flyways along the west coast and the midwest, Meade said. “The more people you have on the ground that help us to generate the data now and understand what’s happening, the better this is for us and also for the wildlife,” said Christine Marizzi, a co-author of the study and director of community science for BioBus, the mobile research lab working with students. Citizen science programs don’t just expand the number of people collecting samples, Marizzi said. They also build trust in science among communities. “We do this together with the community. We actively involve the community from the beginning,” she said. “Getting information out so we can build trust that you really need once the next pandemic is rolling. That’s going to be very, very important.” Part of the challenge of monitoring the emergence of viruses from animals is the immensity of the task. Usually, animals (and people) are only tested when they are sick—but scientists are now learning that H5N1 can circulate asymptomatically in cows and possibly other animals. Non-invasive sampling like this can monitor for pathogens even when no symptoms are present. There have been gaps in testing during this outbreak of avian influenza, as farms and workers face negative consequences if they test positive. Testing wastewater helps officials understand what pathogens are circulating without testing animals and people directly. “If any of the farms are on municipal sewage, then we can test for it—we don’t have to go on the farms,” Johnson said. “I think this is a really good idea, not just for dairy but particularly downstream of meat-processing plants, so we can keep an eye on whether it’s spread into non-dairy animals. Dairy cow infections are usually detected by testing their milk, since the udders have proven to have high concentrations of the flu virus—but in other animals that aren’t lactating, it might be difficult to know where to test the animal to get accurate results. Testing downstream of meat-processing plants is a great idea because it doesn’t matter what part of the cow it’s in,” Johnson said. H5N1 was detected in the wastewater of nine out of 10 Texas cities surveyed in a recent pre-print study. The bulk of the virus is likely coming from animals, but human infections can’t be ruled out, the authors concluded. “Whether it’s coming from cattle or humans or birds or whatever, let’s get an idea of how much is there, so if there’s a change, we know to pay attention,” Johnson said. “We need a baseline of what’s going on so we can see if things are getting worse or getting better.” If nationwide flu A monitoring had been in place a few months ago, he said, officials may have detected the H5N1 outbreak in cows much sooner. Scientists believe the current outbreak began in late 2023, but it was only detected at the end of March. Wastewater monitoring could also help detect onward transmission from farms, especially into new species. This cow-adapted flu variant could continue gaining mutations as it spills back into bird populations or spills over into new species. “When viruses spend time in different hosts, they evolve to become better at replicating in those hosts. So anytime a virus like this enters a mammalian host and stays there and circulates in that host, it’s something that’s very worrisome to us,” Meade said. “If this gets into pigs, that’s when we need to start getting nervous,” Johnson said. Typically, pigs are only checked for illnesses like these when they get sick, but asymptomatic infections could go unnoticed. “If the pigs aren’t getting sick, they could be in pigs already and we wouldn’t know it.” Undetected infections among people would also be a major concern. “If we missed it in dairy cattle for five months, we could miss it in something else. And it could be something much more concerning than dairy cows,” Johnson said.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_3", "statement": "When viruses spend time in different hosts, they evolve to become better at replicating in those hosts.

{"id": "595", "fulltext": "Muscle from a sick dairy cow tested positive for the virus. The meat did not enter the commercial food supply, which officials said remained safe. Beef tissue from a sick dairy cow has tested positive for the bird flu virus, federal officials said on Friday. The cow had been condemned to be culled because it was sick, and the meat did not enter the food supply, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The department continued to stress that the commercial food supply remained safe. But the positive test, which came as part of an ongoing federal study of beef safety, raises concerns about whether the virus might make its way into the commercial beef supply, posing a health risk to humans. So far, the virus, which is known as H5N1, has only been detected in dairy cattle and not in the beef cattle that are raised for meat. But experts believe that the outbreak is bigger than the official tally of 58 affected dairy herds in nine states. 'It's evident that this is widespread and will require constant vigilance,' said Brian Ronholm, the director of food policy at Consumer Reports, an advocacy organization. Overall, he said, he believed that the risk to consumers remained low. But, he added, 'It will be important for consumers to make sure they cook meat to the proper temperature for additional assurance.' Officials and experts have said that thorough cooking was likely to destroy any virus that might make its way into meat; preliminary lab tests of ground beef supports that idea. But Dr. Gail Hansen, an independent food safety and veterinary health expert who has been critical of the federal government's response to the dairy cow outbreak, said that officials were being overly confident in the safety of beef. 'People do eat meat rare and even raw,' she said. 'So once again the assurances from government agencies, before the science is in to confirm or deny the assumptions, continue to undermine the confidence by the public.' The U.S.D.A. said the fact that inspectors had identified the ill cow, and prevented its meat from entering the food supply, was proof that its protocols were working. But some infected cows have been asymptomatic and may not be caught by such inspection systems. The agency has not found virus in ground beef samples collected from retail outlets in states where cows have tested positive. So far, the agency's Food Safety and Inspection Service has tested tissue samples from 96 dairy cows that had been condemned because of signs of disease. Just samples from one cow tested positive for H5N1, according to the agency, which is in the process of testing additional muscle samples. The findings released Friday were further indication that people should take care cooking and preparing meat, said Dr. David Acheson, a former chief medical officer of the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the U.S.D.A. Food safety experts recommend always thoroughly cooking meat to prevent infection from more common pathogens such as salmonella, listeria and E. coli. 'Those food safety recommendations were in store long before H5N1 became an issue, and they should always be our basic standard,' said Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Earlier this month, the U.S.D.A. released results from an experimental study in which researchers added high concentrations of the virus into beef patties. The researchers found no virus present in the meat when they cooked the burger to 160 degrees Fahrenheit, the internal temperature of a well-done burger, or 145 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a burger cooked to medium. However, there was virus present in rare burgers, cooked to 120 degrees, although at greatly reduced levels; the agency said cooking to that temperature 'substantially inactivated the virus.' 'All indications are: You cook your food, even if there's virus in there, it will kill it,' said Stacey Schultz-Cherry, a virologist and influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Experts would like to know more about the positive sample, including the levels of virus it contained, said Matthew Moore, a food science expert at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. It's unclear whether the virus was viable or inactivated. Whether people can contract avian flu by eating contaminated food also remains an open question. A study published on Friday found that unpasteurized milk contaminated with the virus sickened mice, heightening concerns among experts that consuming raw milk could harm humans. Several cats have also died after drinking contaminated raw milk.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "The positive test, which came as part of an ongoing federal study of beef safety, raises concerns about whether the virus might make its way into the commercial beef supply, posing a health risk to humans."}]}
{"id": "600", "fulltext": "The results bolster evidence that virus-laden raw milk may be unsafe for humans. Unpasteurized milk contaminated with H5N1, the bird-flu virus that has turned up in dairy herds in nine states, has been found to rapidly make mice sick, affecting multiple organs, according to a study published on Friday. The findings are not entirely surprising: At least a half-dozen cats have died after consuming raw milk containing the virus. But the new data add to evidence that virus-laden raw milk may be unsafe for other mammals, including humans. 'Don't drink raw milk -- that's the message,' said Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who led the study. Most commercial milk in the United States is pasteurized. The Food and Drug Administration has found traces of the virus in 20 percent of dairy products sampled from grocery shelves nationwide. Officials have not found signs of infectious virus in those samples and have said that pasteurized milk is safe to consume. But the findings have global implications, said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, director of the Boston University Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases, who was not involved in the work. 'If this becomes a more widespread outbreak in cows, there are other places where there isn't central pasteurization,' she cautioned, 'and there are a lot more rural communities that drink milk.' In the study, Dr. Kawaoka and his colleagues analyzed virus from milk samples from an affected dairy herd in New Mexico. The researchers found that levels of the virus declined slowly in a sample of milk stored at 4 degrees Celsius, suggesting that H5N1 in refrigerated raw milk may remain infectious for several weeks. The findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Flu viruses survive well at refrigerator temperatures, and the protein in milk also helps to stabilize them, said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, who was not involved in the work. If people who drink raw milk believe that refrigeration kills the virus, 'this clearly shows that's not the case,' Dr. Webby said. Mice that were fed the contaminated milk quickly became ill, displaying ruffled fur and lethargy. On the fourth day, the mice were euthanized, and researchers found high levels of the virus in the respiratory system and moderate levels in several other organs. Like infected cows, the mice also harbored the virus in their mammary glands -- an unexpected finding. 'These mice are not lactating mice; still the virus can be found in mammary glands,' Dr. Kawaoka said. 'It's very interesting.' It is unclear whether the presence of virus in mammary glands is a feature of this particular virus or of bird-flu viruses in general, Dr. Webby said: 'We're learning new things every single day.' Mice are common pests in farms, providing yet another potential host for the virus, and cats and birds that feed on infected mice could also become ill. The cats that died after drinking contaminated milk showed striking neurological symptoms, including stiff body movements, blindness, a tendency to walk in circles and a weak blink response. If the mice had been allowed to live longer, they might have developed similar symptoms, Dr. Webby said. Also unclear is what the findings mean for the course of infection in people. On Wednesday, federal officials announced that a second dairy worker had tested positive for the H5N1 virus; a nasal swab from that person had tested negative for the virus, but an eye swab tested positive. Pasteurization kills germs by heating milk to high temperatures. In the new study, when researchers heated the milk at the temperatures and time periods typically used for pasteurization, the virus was either undetectable or greatly diminished, but it was not completely inactivated. Dr. Kawaoka cautioned that the laboratory conditions were different from those used in commercial pasteurization, so the results did not mean that the milk on grocery shelves contains active virus. By contrast, the findings that raw milk contains large amounts of virus is 'solid,' he said. Raw milk has become popular in recent years as wellness gurus and right-wing commentators have extolled its alleged virtues, even more so since the bird flu outbreak in dairy cows began. Some argue that it tastes better and is more nutritious than pasteurized milk. Others contend that it boosts immunity. On the contrary, pasteurization preserves calcium, the key nutrient in milk, and adds vitamin D to help absorb it. Consuming raw milk can lead to serious complications or even death from a variety of pathogens, especially in people with weakened immune systems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 1998 to 2018, outbreaks traced to raw milk consumption led to 228 hospitalizations, three deaths and illness in more than 2,600 people. Unpasteurized milk with bird flu virus made mice rapidly sick, according to a study in The New England Journal of Medicine (PHOTOGRAPH BY JONEL ALECCIA/ASSOCIATED PRESS) This article appeared in print on page A21.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "If this becomes a more widespread outbreak in cows, there are other places where there isn't central pasteurization, and there are a lot more rural communities that drink milk."}]}
{"id": "614", "fulltext": "(CNN) — A third person in the US has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday. This is the second human case reported in the state and the fourth ever in the US. This time, in addition to some of the eye symptoms seen with previous H5N1 cases, the farmworker reported a cough and other respiratory symptoms that are more typical of human influenza infections, the health department said. \"This individual had respiratory symptoms, including a cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes,\" Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a briefing Thursday. \"What the respiratory symptoms tell us, more than anything, is that this virus, like many viruses, can present in more than one way, and for that reason, we should remain alert, not be alarmed,\" he added. Experts said that the addition of respiratory symptoms doesn't necessarily indicate that the virus has become more dangerous or that it may transmit more easily from person to person. Instead, they say, the person probably developed lung symptoms because of the route of infection, perhaps by breathing in infectious aerosols in the milking parlor instead of rubbing their eyes with contaminated hands. \"With the first case in Michigan, eye symptoms occurred after a direct splash of infected milk to the eye. With this case, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow,\" Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive for Michigan, said in a news release. \"Neither individual was wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE). This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms. We have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission, and the current health risk to the general public remains low.\" About 220 people are being monitored in Michigan because of potential exposure to the virus, Shah said. Michigan, the state with the highest number of dairy herds reported to be infected, is also beginning to conduct blood testing to see how many workers may have antibodies to the H5N1 virus, which would reflect past infections or exposures. The CDC agreed that the risk to the general public remains low. But this case highlights the elevated risk to those who work with infected animals. The CDC has recommended that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. \"Previously, we focused on the importance of eye protection, given the conjunctivitis in the first two cases, but this case also underscores the importance of barrier protection, things like masks and other forms of protection for dairy workers, particularly those who are working with affected cows,\" Shah said. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them. This is the third human infection known to be caused by this highly pathogenic form of avian influenza that's currently infecting dairy cattle in the US. None of the three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission. The other two cases involved eye infections, or conjunctivitis. The most recent worker had some mild eye symptoms but was not diagnosed with conjunctivitis. The person had direct contact with infected cattle and notified local health officials that they were feeling sick. Their symptoms are described as mild. The patient has been given the antiviral medication oseltamivir, the same active ingredient as Tamiflu, and they are isolating at home. Their family members have not developed symptoms, but they have also been offered antiviral medication as a precaution. None of the other workers at the dairy farm has gotten sick, and they are being monitored, the CDC said. \"Given the high magnitude of interactions between people and dairy cows as well as with contaminated milking equipment, it is unsurprising that there are more human infections,\" said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University who is studying how the virus is transmitting in dairy barns. \"Every time the virus is able to replicate in a person, there is the potential for the virus to adapt to humans and gain molecular features for replication in the respiratory tract and to spread person-to-person,\" Lakdawala said. Flu viruses are classified by two of the proteins that sit on their outer envelopes: H, or hemagglutinin, proteins and N, neuraminidase, proteins. CDC testing has confirmed that this third person carries a flu virus with an H5 protein, and the agency will do further sequencing to determine whether the N portion of the virus is N1, as is suspected. It expects to have those results in the next few days. The CDC confirmed Wednesday night that the person had an H5 influenza infection and forwarded the results to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The US Department of Health and Human Services announced last week that it was moving forward with a plan to repackage 4.8 million doses of a vaccine against H5N1 that is stored in bulk form in the Strategic National Stockpile. The bulk supplies would be put into multidose vials so they could be distributed and administered more easily. Officials said Thursday that before the vaccine would be given, it would need to go through certain regulatory steps. They also said there's not currently a plan to offer or recommend the doses to any specific group of people. The fill-and-finish process to repackage the vaccines will take at least a couple of months, officials said in the news briefing. In the meantime, Michigan's health department is advising people working on poultry or dairy farms to get a seasonal flu vaccine. \"It will not prevent infection with avian influenza viruses, but it can reduce the risk of coinfection with avian and flu viruses,\" the department said.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "Every time the virus is able to replicate in a person, there is the potential for the virus to adapt to humans and gain molecular features for replication in the respiratory tract and to spread person-to-person."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_3", "statement": "Given the high magnitude of interactions between people and dairy cows as well as with contaminated milking equipment, it is unsurprising that there are more human infections."}]}
{"id": "616", "fulltext": "A third human case of H5 bird flu tied to the ongoing U.S. outbreak in cattle has been detected in a farm worker in Michigan, state health authorities confirmed on Thursday. The unnamed individual worked on a dairy farm and was in close contact with infected cows, the state health department said in a statement. The farm involved is different from the one where an earlier human case was detected last week. \"With this case, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow,\" Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement. The individual was not wearing protective equipment, she said. In a separate statement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the individual had a cough without a fever and \"eye discomfort\" with watery discharge. H5N1 bird flu: Go deeper The federal response to bird flu spreading among dairy cattle could be hampered by USDA-FDA turf wars. Scientists with 30 years of experience in avian flu are watching the latest outbreak developments with vigilance and dread. The CDC launched a bird flu wastewater surveillance dashboard to warn localities of possible outbreaks. Many dairy farmers were reluctant to embrace H5N1 control measures, so the federal government started offering incentives for bird flu protective measures. The significance of respiratory symptoms relates to the possibility of onward spread. In people, influenza transmits via the respiratory route. A person with flu virus in their airways could be more likely to spread the virus if the virus has the capacity to transmit between humans than a person with an infection in their eye. To date, H5 viruses have not been seen to spread easily among people, and Michigan and federal officials said the risk to the general public remains low. \"What the presence of respiratory symptoms tells us is that the exposure risk is higher,\" CDC Deputy Director Nirav Shah said at a news conference Thursday. \"Simply put, someone who's coughing may be more likely to transmit the virus than someone who has an eye infection like conjunctivitis.\" The worker was given flu antiviral drugs and is recovering. \"The individual was not hospitalized. We would characterize this as a mild illness,\" Bagdasarian said in an interview with STAT. She said the farmworker was caring for sick cows and had a significant amount of exposure to the animals. Likewise, the previous Michigan case had had milk from an infected cow splash into his eye. \"This is not walking past an infected animal. This is not a very transient or limited exposure,\" Bagdasarian said. The CDC said the individual was instructed to isolate, and household contacts were also offered antiviral drugs. Asked whether the contacts agreed to take the drugs, Bagdasarian sidestepped the question, noting that people have the right to choose whether or not they wish to comply. \"In general, all of this is voluntary. We don't have any requirements that folks either must wear PPE in certain situations, that they must undergo testing, that they must receive Tamiflu,\" she said, stressing that achieving compliance requires creating a rapport between public health workers and the individuals with whom they are interacting. She noted that over the course of Michigan's response to the H5N1 situation, several people have refused to be tested and several have refused the offer of antiviral drugs. Related: New evidence supports fear that drinking raw milk containing bird flu viruses may be dangerous To date, there is no evidence of other infections from the farm where the individual was infected. \"No other workers at the same farm have reported symptoms, and all staff are being monitored. There is no indication of person-to-person spread of A(H5N1) viruses at this time,\" the CDC said in its statement. At least 40 people have been tested for the virus, and roughly 350 workers are being monitored, many of them in Michigan, Shah said. \"We would like to be doing more testing,\" he added. Also on Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced it will put an additional $824 million toward broader testing and surveillance for the bird flu on dairy farms, and it is launching a voluntary pilot program for farms to consistently test milk. If herds show no sign of H5N1 for three weeks, farmers participating in the pilot can freely move the cattle without having to test them. Federal officials also said that while states are supplying personal protective equipment to farmworkers, uptake has been \"mixed.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told STAT last week that five states had requested gear, primarily goggles, from the national stockpile. State public health officials \"have been trying to make PPE more available, but there's just not demand for it,\" said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. The low uptake will likely persist as temperatures rise in the summer, he and federal health officials said. Of the four known cases of H5 infection that have been reported in the United States three since the outbreak in cattle began this is the first in which an infected individual reported respiratory symptoms. The two human cases reported earlier this year experienced only conjunctivitis known as pink eye. Those cases occurred in Texas and in Michigan, and were both in farmworkers who had contact with infected cows. The first U.S. case of H5N1 occurred in April 2022 and involved a man in Colorado who was involved in culling chickens on a poultry farm where the virus had broken out; though he tested positive for the virus, he reported only feeling fatigue. The Michigan statement described the virus in the new case solely as an H5 virus. The CDC, which does confirmatory testing for H5N1 cases, said it is attempting to generate a full genetic sequence of the virus and if the efforts are successful, it will release further information in a day or two. Related: Wastewater testing specifically for bird flu virus will scale up nationally in coming weeks Prior to this outbreak, it was not believed that cattle could be infected with this virus an assumption that probably contributed to the slow realization that a mystery illness that was affecting milk production in some dairy herds located in the Texas panhandle starting in February was actually avian influenza. Since the late March announcement that H5N1 was the reason for the drop in milk production, the USDA has confirmed 69 infected livestock herds in nine states. One of the herds was alpacas, the rest have been dairy cattle. Infectious disease experts suspect the outbreak is more widespread than the number of confirmed states would suggest, a belief that is supported by a survey of commercially purchased milk conducted by the Food and Drug Administration. Of nearly 300 pasteurized milk products bought in 38 states, 1 in 5 were positive by polymerase chain reaction testing for the H5N1 virus. Efforts to grow viable virus from milk that tested positive failed, supporting the FDA's position that pasteurization kills the virus. There are concerns, though, that unpasteurized milk generally referred to as raw milk could subject consumers to dangerous levels of the virus, if the herd that produced the milk was infected with H5N1. A study published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that mice fed raw milk known to have come from infected cows made the mice sick enough that they had to be euthanized. There have been multiple reports of deaths of cats on farms with infected herds, and one of the infected alpacas displayed neurological symptoms before it died, Sydney Kennedy, a public information officer for the Idaho State Department of Agriculture, told STAT in an email. While the virus is deadly in poultry, and has been seen to kill multiple mammal species from polar bears to foxes, from zoo tigers to sea lions it does not, in general, seriously sicken cows. As a result, there's been little upside for farmers to agree to have their animals tested. While the case count continues to grow in most of the states with confirmed herds, there has not been a new state to acknowledge having infected animals since Colorado joined the list on April 25. A federal order that went into effect on April 29 requires farmers to test some of the lactating cows they plan to transport over state lines, though they are required to test a maximum of 30 animals per shipment, and the farmer can choose which animals are tested. The USDA announced Wednesday that nearly 2,500 pre-movement tests have been conducted. It did not say how many of those tests produced positive results, and the agency has not acknowledged or responded to a STAT request for that figure.

{"id": "620", "fulltext": "The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reported on Thursday that another farmworker has been infected with H5N1, an avian flu virus. Alarmingly, unlike earlier cases, he has respiratory symptoms. This means the virus is in his lungs, where it has a better chance to evolve into an airborne form that could easily infect others. Viruses often hit a dead end when they cross from one species to another, getting stuck at their first victim. For example, H5N1 has been around since the 1990s, but most patients have had extensive, direct contact with sick poultry and almost never pass it on to other humans. The pathogens that have the greatest potential to set off a pandemic often have a deadly combination of airborne transmission and frequent mild cases, allowing them to spread widely and stealthily. That's a key reason there hasn't yet been an Ebola pandemic. The disease causes severe illness and kills most victims, and it mainly spreads through close contact with infected bodily fluids. It has fewer chances to spread widely than another disease might. The United States is certainly giving H5N1 many, many chances to adapt to spreading easily and quietly among humans. Cows started getting sick with H5N1 last winter, but unlike birds with H5N1, they weren't dying. It took dogged investigation by Dr. Barb Petersen, a veterinarian in Texas, to determine that they were afflicted with a form of avian influenza. When we spoke, she told me that whenever cows fell sick on farms she monitored, an unusual number of people also became ill. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a farmworker in Texas had been infected with H5N1. This month, state health officials in Michigan found two more human cases (including the one reported on Thursday). Even so, public health officials have largely been slow to establish the sort of widespread testing and data sharing that would give Americans the best chance at stopping an H5N1 pandemic. This month, Dr. Mandy Cohen, the director of the C.D.C., told The New York Times there were no immediate plans to make testing mandatory. But if we don't test for H5N1, we won't find it. As Rick Bright, an expert on the H5N1 virus who served on President Biden's coronavirus advisory board, told me: \"We are missing additional cases by not testing. We are missing evolutionary patterns of the virus by not sequencing more. We are also losing the trust of people by not being completely timely and transparent with data and information as it becomes available.\" This virus may never evolve to spread dangerously among humans, but if it does, this particular avian flu pandemic will go down as one of the most avoidable slow-motion disasters in history.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_6", "statement": "As Rick Bright, an expert on the H5N1 virus who served on President Biden's coronavirus advisory board, told me: 'We are missing additional cases by not testing.

{"id": "624", "fulltext": "Bird flu has been behaving very strangely lately. A strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) has been spreading in dairy cows in at least nine U.S. states. Infected cows have very high levels of virus in their milk, and early reports indicate that it is being spread by contaminated milking equipment, although other methods of transmission are also possible. Several cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological symptoms and died. Pasteurizing milk appears to effectively neutralize the H5N1 virus. In recent weeks, three human infections with the virus have been confirmed—all in dairy workers who had contact with sick cows. All three developed symptoms of eye infections known as conjunctivitis. The latest case, reported in Michigan this week, also involved respiratory symptoms more typical of a flu infection. The workers were most likely exposed to the virus in contaminated milk—by getting it on their hands and then touching their eyes, for example, or via milk droplets (or even microscopic particles called aerosols) from a cow's udder or milking equipment. “It is really surprising how widespread this thing got over a few months’ time and how this virus seems to be spreading through the milking machines from udder to udder,” says Ron Fouchier, deputy head of the viroscience department at Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam in the Netherlands. “This is a completely new situation for all of us, and it’s surprising and a little bit worrying because of the enormous amounts of virus that can be in raw milk.” But why is H5N1 causing eye infections in humans? And is there a risk the virus could spread more widely and potentially cause a pandemic? In fact, cases of avian flu causing conjunctivitis are not that rare. There was a large outbreak of H7N7 avian flu in poultry in the Netherlands in 2003, which led to 89 confirmed human cases. Of these, 78 people had conjunctivitis; five had both conjunctivitis and flulike illness and two had only flulike illness. One person developed pneumonia and respiratory distress and died, according to a 2004 study by Fouchier and his colleagues. “We’ve seen this [conjunctivitis] also before with... H7N7 viruses quite a lot and a little bit less with H5 bird flu viruses,” Fouchier says. (The latter is the type now spreading in cows.) “But we know that these bird flu viruses can cause conjunctivitis rather easily.” In the recent H5N1 outbreak in cows and infections in humans, viruses that got into workers’ eyes may have bound to receptors in the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the inside of the eyelid and the white of the eye and protects the eye. Influenza viruses bind to what are called sialic acid receptors. The accepted wisdom suggests that avian flu viruses preferentially bind to one type of sialic acid receptor predominant in birds, whereas human seasonal flu viruses bind to another type of sialic acid receptor predominant in the human respiratory tract, says Patrik Ellström, an infection medicine researcher at Sweden’s Uppsala University. But recent research suggests the picture is more complicated; both receptor types have now been found in the respiratory tracts of humans and birds. So it’s not clear that the virus would need to bind to the “human” receptor to cause infection, Ellström says. In the human eye, however, the “bird” receptor is the one most frequently found, and this could explain why the virus in cows is causing eye infections in humans. An H5N1 eye infection could conceivably spread to a person’s respiratory system via the sinuses and possibly cause a more severe, systemic infection, Fouchier says. That’s likely what happened with the one person known to have died in the 2003 outbreak in the Netherlands. So far, there is little evidence that the currently circulating strain of H5N1 is spreading person to person, although that could change. The more the virus spreads from cows to people and the more people who become infected, the higher its chances of evolving to become better at infecting and spreading among humans. “Given the amount of virus detected in milk from H5N1 virus-infected cows, I am concerned about its spillover to humans, poultry and other animals,” says Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a professor of virology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s School of Veterinary Medicine. Conditions in many milking parlors can be especially conducive to spreading the virus among workers via milk, according to Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University School of Medicine and an expert in influenza virus transmission. Lakdawala says she recently visited a parlor to observe the milking process. “It was eye-opening to me, and I, of course, got splattered on my face with milk because that’s what happens,” she says. The cows were on a platform that put their udder roughly at eye level so humans could access it easily, she says. The first step in milking was “forestripping,” in which a worker very briefly milks the animal by hand to start lactation. When Lakdawala was watching this process, “these animals were just leaking,” she says, comparing the effect to that of water misters in a plant nursery. Next, the cow’s udder was disinfected, and the workers attached a tube capped by a cup to each teat with a liner that inflates to exert pressure: “basically a breast pump for a cow teat,” Lakdawala says. As anyone who has breastfed a child knows, the breast pump gets totally coated with milk, Lakdawala says. And although workers disinfect the udder, they don’t always do so to the milking equipment between animals, she says, so it’s easy to see how an infected cow could transmit the bird flu virus to another cow via the milking pump and how workers could be infected by splashing milk droplets. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that workers on farms where H5N1 has been detected have access to personal protective equipment, or PPE, such as N95 respirators, face masks, goggles and face shields. But it’s only a recommendation, Lakdawala says. In order to prevent bird flu from causing more infections in humans, Lakdawala thinks dairy workers on all farms should have access to and use proper PPE—especially face shields to protect their eyes. Getting workers to wear N95 masks while working all day in hot barns is unlikely, she notes, but a face shield would provide at least some protection. Additionally, all dairy workers and veterinarians visiting those farms should be offered H5N1 vaccines, she says. Lakdawala says it is crucial to get farm owners, workers and state public health officials to come together and figure out how to stop the spread of this virus. “No farm owner wants their working staff out sick,” she says, and “none of us in public health want those workers to get sick.” It’s a daunting problem, she admits. But there is still a chance to act before any potential sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus. In addition to providing every farmworker with PPE, Lakdawala believes the CDC should issue a “stay-at-farm” order for all cows “to get an assessment of what is happening and the extent of what has happened.” Tens of thousands of cows are transported across the country every week, she says. The U.S. Department of Agriculture now requires lactating cows from farms with known H5N1 infections to be tested before they can be transported to other states. But Lakdawala thinks the industry should temporarily stop moving all cows around. Finally, she says that experts and officials need to talk with farmers about how to reduce contamination of milking equipment and about how to safely dispose of milk from infected animals. “Nobody, no one, absolutely nobody, wants another pandemic,” Lakdawala says. “We really need to take a moment and do everything we possibly can right now to prevent it.”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_3", "statement": "Given the amount of virus detected in milk from H5N1 virus-infected cows, I am concerned about its spillover to humans, poultry and other animals."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_5", "statement": "Nobody, no one, absolutely nobody, wants another pandemic."}]}
{"id": "627", "fulltext": "When H5N1 avian influenza started spreading among dairy cattle across the U.S. this year, regulators warned against consuming unpasteurized milk. What happened? Raw milk sales went up. Distributors of this unsafe-for-human-consumption product deny H5N1—which has the potential to sicken millions of people—is a danger. Dairy farmers decline to allow disease detectives onto their properties. After 25 years of watching, waiting and worrying about bird flu, what finally tips it over into a pandemic could be American contrariness. Trust in public health and government are near an all-time low. At the same time, the federal government is unprepared for a new pandemic: It doesn’t have enough vaccines, and there is no plan for getting them out quickly. The public health infrastructure has not come even close to recovering after COVID, and people are going to resist measures that might help control a new epidemic, such as school closures or even mask use. The population is largely resigned to infection and death. At such a vulnerable point in time, an old enemy, bird flu, moves into a new host: the milk cow. It’s an animal that people are in constant and intimate contact with, and whose flesh and milk are consumed daily. One possible scenario for spillover into the population: a raw-milk drinker or a farmworker gets infected with this strain of H5N1 that’s moving among cattle and also gets co-infected with a human-adapted strain of influenza. In such a situation viruses can swap genes in a process called reassortment. A major fear about H5N1 has always been that it might do this. H5N1 has shown it can easily move from one species to another, acquiring new genetic material in the process. Or someone catches H5N1 from a cow or its raw milk, and—perhaps through an immune deficiency—they develop a long-lasting infection that allows the virus to mutate in their body. “There absolutely is a risk here,” says Richard Webby, an expert in animal and human viruses who works at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis. Here’s what it takes for a virus to start a human pandemic: it must acquire the ability to infect people easily; it must then pass easily from person to person; and it must cause significant illness. “The more it spreads within mammals, that gives it more chances to mutate. As it mutates, as it changes, there is a greater chance it can infect humans. If it gains the ability to spread efficiently from person to person, then it would be hard to stop,” says Nita Madhav, a former U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researcher who is now senior director of epidemiology and modeling at Ginkgo Biosecurity. This can happen fast. “We’ve all seen how a virus can spread around the globe before public health has even had a chance to get its shoes on,” Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the CDC, said at a Council on Foreign Relations briefing in May. It only took three years for COVID to kill seven million people. So far, the H5N1 virus has infected three dairy farm workers, according to the CDC. Those are the known cases. The CDC has not even begun to jump through the hoops needed to force inspections and testing—and any such moves would almost certainly result in prolonged legal battles with both the dairy industry and some states. The symptoms were mild in two workers: an eye infection known as conjunctivitis. But the third worker had respiratory symptoms, the Michigan health department says—something that might lead to easier spread. The same strain of the virus has killed more than a few farm cats, and a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May shows the virus infected multiple organs in mice that drank H5N1-contaminated raw milk. Mild symptoms mean it could be spreading, unnoticed, among people. What’s called for now is stepped-up surveillance, ideally on dairy farms across the country, with regular testing of the milk supply and in clinics where dairy farms are concentrated. Ideally the CDC would test populations of raw milk enthusiasts. The CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are trying to get onto farms to test, but with only limited success. Dairy owners don’t want the stigma of having the virus found on their farms, and workers are worried they will be questioned about their immigration status or that they’ll be deported if they are found to be infected. Worse, if the federal government does decide to take a serious stand on the virus and announce measures to get out ahead of it, it will almost certainly become a divisive campaign issue in the current election. It is easy to imagine former president Donald Trump telling his supporters that the Biden administration is inventing an imaginary threat to scare them. Moreover, disinformation and misinformation have never been worse, thanks in no small part to social media. “Drink raw milk so that you don’t get bird flu,” urges one distributor on X, formerly Twitter. People have always had odd ideas about how to resist disease, from the notion that eating certain diets can boost immunity to the widely debunked Great Barrington Declaration that called for allowing COVID-19 to spread through most of the population to build up some kind of natural immunity, a recipe for overloaded ICUs and mass deaths. These are all natural reactions, says Jennifer Nuzzo, professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health: “When extraordinary things happen, a common psychological response is to deny it. ‘It can’t be happening.’” But after having seen this response in real time during COVID, the U.S. and many other governments have done too little to learn from their mistakes. “We have literally not made any serious effort to understand what worked and what didn’t,” Nuzzo says. The federal government and its agencies haven’t even gone back to pre-COVID studies about how to communicate with the public and how to coax the reluctant into cooperating with public health measures. It takes a gentle, almost personalized, approach—one that would work best on the basis of a long-term, familiar relationship. The best messengers are individuals or institutions that already have the trust of the targeted audience. “In an ideal world our response to [a pandemic threat] would be voluntary where everyone chooses to take actions to protect themselves, their community, their loved ones,” Nuzzo says. “We just can’t compel people to take action that is not in their best interests. You have to convince them that it is in their best interests and help people feel like they are part of the solution.” But in 2024 trust in institutions is elusive. The FDA urged consumers to avoid raw milk after H5N1 was found in one out of five samples of commercially available milk it tested. That’s when sales of raw milk took off. “People that follow us—if FDA says it’s bad, they'll run [toward] it,” Marc McAfee, a dairy farmer in California who founded the Raw Milk Institute, told NPR. That’s what raw milk promoters are doing now. There’s never a good time for a flu virus to find a new way to circulate, but with American stubbornness hitting a new peak, 2024 could not be a worse time.

{"id": "629", "fulltext": "Huge die-offs of elephant seals occurred after the virus gained nearly 20 troublesome new mutations, scientists found. Elephant seals in South America died in massive numbers because the bird flu virus acquired mutations that allowed it to spread among mammals, according to a new study. The research offers the first genetic and epidemiological evidence of bird flu virus transmission among mammals. And the findings hold a warning: The virus, called H5N1, may similarly transform to cause large-scale infections in other mammalian species, including people. The bird flu virus is responsible for an ongoing outbreak in dairy cows in the United States. Since March, it has been detected in cows in 11 states, and in wastewater from several others. The virus may already be spreading from cow to cow, too, but federal officials have said that the more likely explanation for the outbreak is that it is spreading through contaminated milk. Infected cows have large amounts of virus in their milk, which may be thick and yellowish. Some cows have been slaughtered because they never returned to normal milk production, and some have died of secondary infections, according to a Reuters report. H5N1 is also presumed to have spread among mink on a fur farm in Spain. But the new study is the first to pull together different streams of evidence that substantiate transmission from mammal to mammal. The study was posted online on Saturday and has not been peer reviewed. But genetic analysis of the virus, and the scale and timing of infections in sea mammals in South America, all suggest that the animals acquired the virus from one another, not from infected birds, the researchers said. 'It's a combination of facts that really present compelling evidence that there is some sort of mammal-to-mammal transmission,' said Marcela Uhart, who led the new study and directs the Latin American wildlife health program at the University of California, Davis. In 2022 and 2023, H5N1 killed more than 30,000 sea lions in Peru and Chile, along with some porpoises, dolphins and otters. It traveled down the Pacific Coast and then marched back up the Atlantic coast through Argentina and into Uruguay and Brazil. Last October, there was a 'tsunami of virus' in Argentine Patagonia that wiped out more than 17,000 elephant seals, Dr. Uhart said, adding that those numbers make it unlikely that the virus jumped from a bird to a sea mammal each time. Mammal-to-mammal transmission is 'nearly the only explanation of how it went around the entire southern tip of the continent and continued to spread,' he said. 'Honestly, there are not very many more ways this could have happened.' In the new study, Dr. Uhart and her colleagues studied virus samples from elephant seal pups and terns. Their genetic analysis suggests that H5N1 jumped at least three times from wild birds to marine mammals on the Pacific Coast of South America, and then evolved to spread between elephant seals. The team presented some of these data at small meetings, but other researchers were resistant to the idea that sea mammals were infecting one another, Dr. Uhart said. Some scientists suggested that the mammals were all infected by birds. But a majority of terns died about three weeks after the mass deaths in sea lions and elephant seals. In fact, Dr. Uhart and her colleagues found evidence suggesting that the virus jumped from sea mammals back into birds—an unwelcome development, because infected birds can disperse the virus wherever they migrate. The researchers found H5N1 in the windpipes, lungs and brains of carcasses of sea mammals. It is unclear whether the virus spread through air or through some other route. But in lab experiments, the virus has been shown to be transmissible through air and via direct contact among ferrets. Bird flu virus taken from the sea animals contained 18 mutations that enabled it to infect and spread among mammals more easily, and enhanced the severity of the disease, the researchers found. 'The sheer number of mutations is cause for concern,' said Dr. Malik Peiris, a virologist and bird flu expert at the University of Hong Kong, who was not involved in the work. In contrast, there are hardly any mutations that represent adaptation to mammals in the infected cows. 'But this could be a matter of time,' Dr. Peiris said. None of the mutations was found to affect hemagglutinin, or HA, the viral protein that latches on to receptors in humans and animals. Other studies have suggested that changes in HA are crucial for H5N1 to spread among people, and may precede mutations in other parts of the virus. But 'even though the HA has not changed, you have other mutations that may be of concern,' said Agustina Rimondi, a virologist at the INTA-CONICET virology institute in Buenos Aires, who led the genetic analysis. Every infection affords the virus new opportunities to evolve and to acquire mutations that may allow it to more easily infect people, she said. Among the mutations found in virus from sea mammals are two, D701N and Q591K, that alter an enzyme the virus needs to replicate. Both mutations are thought to be alternatives to another mutation called E627K, which is believed to be a key change needed for the virus to infect mammals. The mutations merit further investigation, but they may not be followed by the changes needed in HA and do not necessarily portend transmission among people, said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, who was not involved in the work. 'The HA receptor changes make it easier for the others to emerge, but I don't think it works the other way around,' he said. Dr. Webby cautioned against thinking of all mammals as a homogeneous group. 'I don't think sea mammals are the same as humans, in terms of susceptibility,' he said. 'Maybe replication in sea mammals doesn't drive the virus to be more able to infect humans.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "The findings hold a warning: The virus, called H5N1, may similarly transform to cause large-scale infections in other mammalian species, including people."}]}
{"id": "639", "fulltext": "Los investigadores descubrieron que enormes cantidades de elefantes marinos murieron luego de que el virus adquirió así 20 nuevas mutaciones. [Estamos en WhatsApp. Empieza a seguirnos ahora] De acuerdo con un nuevo estudio, elefantes marinos de Sudamérica murieron en masa porque el virus de la gripe aviar adquirió mutaciones que le permitieron propagarse entre los mamíferos. La investigación ofrece las primeras pruebas genéticas y epidemiológicas de la transmisión del virus de la gripe aviar entre mamíferos. Los hallazgos conllevan una advertencia: el virus, denominado H5N1, puede experimentar transformaciones similares para causar infecciones a gran escala entre otras especies de mamíferos, entre ellos los humanos. El virus de la gripe aviar es responsable de un brote actual en vacas lecheras de Estados Unidos. Desde marzo, se ha detectado en vacas de 11 estados, así como en aguas residuales de varios estados más. Aunque es posible que el virus ya se esté propagando también de vaca a vaca, funcionarios federales han dicho que la explicación más probable es que se esté propagando a través de leche contaminada. Las vacas infectadas presentan grandes cantidades de virus en la leche, que puede ser espesa y amarillenta. Algunas vacas han sido sacrificadas porque nunca volvieron a producir leche con normalidad, y algunas han muerto de infecciones secundarias, según un informe de Reuters. También se sospecha que el H5N1 se ha propagado entre visones en una granja de pieles en España. Sin embargo, el nuevo estudio es el primero que reúne diferentes corrientes de evidencia que corroboran la transmisión de mamífero a mamífero. El estudio, que se publicó en internet el sábado, no ha sido revisado por expertos. No obstante, el análisis genético del virus, así como la escala y el momento en que se dieron las infecciones entre los mamíferos marinos de Sudamérica, sugieren que los animales adquirieron el virus entre sí no de aves infectadas, señalan los investigadores. Es una combinación de sucesos que presentan pruebas realmente convincentes de que hay algún tipo de transmisión de mamífero a mamífero señaló Marcela Uhart, quien dirige el programa de salud de fauna silvestre latinoamericana de la Universidad de California en Davis, y encabezó el nuevo estudio. En 2022 y 2023, el virus H5N1 mató más de 30,000 leones marinos en Perú y Chile, además de algunas marsopas, delfines y nutrias. Se desplazó por la costa del Pacífico y luego remontó la costa atlántica a través de Argentina y hacia Uruguay y Brasil. El pasado mes de octubre se produjo un tsunami de virus en la Patagonia argentina que acabó con más de 17,000 elefantes marinos, explicó Uhart, quien añadió que, tomando en cuenta esas cifras, es poco probable que el virus haya saltado de un ave a un mamífero marino en cada caso individual. La transmisión de mamífero a mamífero es prácticamente la única explicación de cómo recorrió todo el extremo sur del continente y continuó propagándose afirmó realmente no hay muchas otras formas de que esto haya podido ocurrir En el nuevo estudio, Uhart y sus colegas examinaron muestras de virus de crías de elefante marino y charranes. El análisis genético sugiere que el H5N1 saltó al menos tres veces de las aves silvestres a los mamíferos marinos de la costa del Pacífico de Sudamérica, tras lo cual evolucionó para propagarse entre los elefantes marinos. El equipo presentó algunos de estos datos en reuniones con grupos pequeños, pero otros investigadores se resistieron a la idea de que los mamíferos marinos estuvieran infectándose entre sí comentó Uhart. Algunos científicos pensaban que todos los mamíferos habían sido infectados por aves. Sin embargo, una mayoría de los charranes murieron unas tres semanas después de las muertes masivas de leones marinos y elefantes marinos. De hecho, Uhart y sus colegas hallaron indicios de que el virus había saltado de los mamíferos marinos a las aves; un suceso desafortunado, pues las aves infectadas pueden dispersar el virus donde sea que migren. Los investigadores encontraron H5N1 en las tráqueas, pulmones y cerebros de cadáveres de mamíferos marinos. No está claro si el virus se propagó por el aire o por alguna otra vía. En experimentos de laboratorio, se ha demostrado que el virus es transmisible por el aire y por contacto directo entre hurones. El virus de la gripe aviar extraído de los animales marinos contenía 18 mutaciones que le permitían infectar y propagarse entre los mamíferos con mayor facilidad, además de aumentar la gravedad de la enfermedad. El gran número de mutaciones es motivo de preocupación, afirmó Malik Peiris, virólogo y experto en gripe aviar de la Universidad de Hong Kong, quien no participó en el estudio. En cambio, en las vacas infectadas casi no hay mutaciones que representen una adaptación a los mamíferos. Pero esto podría ser cuestión de tiempo puntualizó Peiris. Ninguna de las mutaciones afectaba a la hemaglutinina, o HA, la proteína vírica que se adhiere a los receptores en humanos y animales. Otros estudios han sugerido que los cambios en la HA son cruciales para que el H5N1 se propague entre los humanos, y pueden preceder a mutaciones en otras partes del virus. Sin embargo, aunque la HA no haya cambiado, hay otras mutaciones que podrían ser preocupantes dijo Agustina Rimondi, viróloga del instituto de virología INTA-CONICET de Buenos Aires, quien encabezó el análisis genético. Cada infección ofrece al virus nuevas oportunidades de evolucionar y adquirir mutaciones que pueden permitirle infectar más fácilmente a las personas, explicó Entre las mutaciones encontradas en el virus de los mamíferos marinos, hay dos, D701N y Q591K, que alteran una enzima que el virus necesita para replicarse. Se cree que ambas mutaciones son alternativas a otra mutación llamada E627K, que se considera un cambio clave necesario para que el virus infecte a los mamíferos. Las mutaciones ameritan una investigación más a fondo, pero es posible que no vayan seguidas de los cambios necesarios en la HA y no necesariamente auguran la transmisión entre personas, señaló Richard Webby, experto en gripe del Hospital Infantil de Investigación St. Jude, quien no participó en el estudio. Los cambios en el receptor de la HA facilitan la aparición de los otros, pero no creo que funcione al revés dijo. Webby advirtió que no se debe considerar a todos los mamíferos como un grupo homogéneo. No creo que los mamíferos marinos sean iguales a los humanos, en términos de susceptibilidad afirmó tal vez la replicación en los mamíferos marinos no hace que el virus sea más capaz de infectar a los humanos Apoorva Mandavilli es periodista especializada en ciencia y salud mundial.

The man, who suffered from other underlying health conditions, had no known exposure to poultry or other animals before being formally diagnosed by a laboratory with the H5N2 subtype of avian flu. The case marks the first time a human has been confirmed to be infected with this subtype, and the first time an avian H5 virus was confirmed in a person in Mexico. \"Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance,\" WHO said in a statement. \"This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza,\" it added, rating current risks to the general population as \"low.\" The man had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons, before the onset of acute symptoms, according to WHO. His symptoms first appeared around April 17 and included fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea and general malaise. He sought medical attention on April 24 and was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City. He died later that day. Other subtypes of H5 avian flu have spread to humans, but evidence from previous events have so far suggested that the viruses \"have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission between humans,\" WHO said. People who came in contact with the man shortly before his death have so far not tested positive for H5N2, it added. Bird flu in general threatens the international poultry supply and comes with some risk of spreading to humans, typically through direct contact with an infected animal or contaminated environments. There are no known cases of an individual catching bird flu from eating properly cooked meat, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A highly pathogenic form of bird flu was detected in a goat in March, the first confirmed case in the United States involving a domestic ruminant animal (i.e. cattle, sheep and goats). Within days, avian influenza was found in several U.S. cows and rapidly spread across state lines, with a dairy worker in Texas testing positive in April for H5N1, a different subtype than the one detected in the man in Mexico. Experts have criticized federal agencies in the United States for being slow to track and control the outbreak, with nine states observing outbreaks in cows as of Tuesday. Forty-eight states have recorded outbreaks in poultry, according to the CDC. Four human cases of avian flu have been reported in the United States since April 1; three of the infections followed exposure to dairy cows in Texas and Michigan, while one followed exposure to poultry in Colorado, the CDC said. For those in places with known avian influenza outbreaks, WHO recommends avoiding contact with livestock as well as places where animals could have been raised, slaughtered or may have spread their feces.

{"id": "647", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Mark Naniot remembers 2022 as the summer from hell. As the co-founder of Wild Instincts animal rescue in Wisconsin's Northwoods, Naniot and his team spent the season sweating in gloves, gowns, smocks and masks and going through what felt like endless rounds of disinfection as they moved between the cages of the sick and injured animals they cared for. The precautions were necessary for a trio of infectious diseases occurring with some frequency in wild animals that summer: Covid-19 was still making life difficult, and a devastating contagion called chronic wasting disease was showing up in deer in the area. Then, there was H5N1 bird flu to contend with. \"It's highly, highly transmissible,\" said Naniot, who has been involved in animal rescue for 35 years. Since it was first discovered in birds in 1996, H5N1 has shown itself to be a Swiss Army Knife of a virus, evolving the necessary tools to break into the cells of a growing list of species. So far, it has infected and killed millions of wild and farmed birds. It's also been found in at least 26 different kinds of mammals, including, most recently in the United States — cows, cats and house mice. The voraciousness of the virus prompted Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist of the World Health Organization in April to call it \"a global zoonotic animal pandemic.\" Along the way, people have been a kind of collateral damage. Humans can be infected, but we aren't really the intended targets. That could all change quickly, however. \"Influenza actually makes mutations, in the sense of making errors copying its genome, at a higher rate than a coronavirus like SARS-CoV2,\" said Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist who focuses on influenza viruses at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. These errors don't always work in favor of the virus. Most of the time, viruses with errors won't work or be fit enough to continue to copy and survive. But every once in a while, a random error can result in a change to the virus that gives it an advantage in its environment, and that version of the virus will continue to spread and grow. If humans happen to be that environment, and H5N1 changes at the right place at the right time, suddenly the animal pandemic could become a major problem for people, too. Naniot had seen wild birds come into Wild Instincts rescue with H5N1 — bald eagles, hawks and owls — but nothing had prepared him for the red fox kits. The baby foxes were brought in stumbling and uncoordinated, making him think they might have gotten into some kind of poison. Then the seizures started. \"They would have these severe, severe seizures,\" Naniot said. \"Screaming very loud, whole-body tremors.\" The first seizures lasted for 20 to 30 seconds at a time. \"And then it would get longer and longer and longer,\" he said. Naniot hadn't known his young patients could get bird flu. Further research clued him in to the fact that foxes had recently joined a growing list of species that could succumb, usually after eating the flesh of infected dead birds. \"The severity of the seizures is something I really hadn't seen before,\" Naniot said. \"It's a very sad thing to see, the progression of the disease.\" Risks to humans Though H5N1 is known to have infected nearly 900 people in the past 30 years, these infections have been sporadic and usually self-limiting. The virus can still be deadly, however: More than 50% of people who are known to have been infected with H5N1 have died. Still, the virus isn't particularly good at infecting humans. Even when the virus manages to get into a person and cause symptoms, it rarely gets passed to someone else. \"We call these dead-end infections,\" said Dr. Scott Weese, a veterinarian and expert in zoonotic infections, at the University of Guelph in Canada. The way a dead-end infection happens, Weese explains, is that a person is around a large amount of the virus, or their immune system is too weak to resist, and H5N1 gets in. But it is not a virus that's well-adapted to humans, so it never really builds up in respiratory secretions — the fluid that coats the nose, throat, and lungs — which would give it a way out through coughs, sneezes or even exhaled breath. There have been at least three of these apparently dead-end infections in dairy workers in the US, who worked closely with infected milk cows. Two of the workers developed conjunctivitis, or eye infections. In one case, the worker reported getting splashed with raw milk in their eyes. A third developed respiratory symptoms after close contact with cows. All were successfully treated with an antiviral medication. None developed severe symptoms or infected others. Using a strain of H5N1 from the recent cattle outbreak, scientists recently confirmed that this version of the virus is unlikely to transmit through the air. In experiments with ferrets, which are considered the gold standard for studying how viruses transmit in people, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grew a sample of the same H5N1 virus taken from a farmworker with the flu in Texas to experimentally infect six of the animals. Then, three healthy ferrets were placed in the same enclosures with three of the sick animals. These animals could touch, nose and lick the sick animals, and all of them became ill. Next, the CDC tested airborne transmission by putting three healthy ferrets into an enclosure where they could breathe the same air as sick animals but couldn't touch them. Only one of those three animals became ill, suggesting that the virus carried by cattle in the current outbreak is not well adapted to respiratory spread, the CDC wrote in a news release on the study. So far, that seems to be what's happening in the real world, too. Though more than 80 dairy herds have tested positive across at least 12 states, the number of human infections has apparently been low, though there's been little testing to confirm that. These early ferret experiments are good news, the CDC noted, because it means the virus would need to change to become an infection spread person-to-person through the airborne droplets. The agency said it plans to repeat the tests. As Covid has shown, all of this could change in the rub of an eye or a small cough. The more opportunity the virus has to spread, the more opportunity it has to change in ways that will help it pry its way into human cells. \"It's really important to understand everything we know today is a snapshot of today, and these viruses can change very quickly,\" said Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and former director of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the Chasing Life podcast. \"They can adapt, and they can spread very easily when they do change,\" said Bright, who is now CEO of Bright Global Health. Dr. Erin Sorrell, a virologist and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says that while humans have been exposed to seasonal strains of the flu, and flu vaccines help build immunity H1 and H3 flu strains, H5N1 would look pretty different to our bodies. \"Our existing immunity to H3 and H1 is not necessarily going to protect us against exposure to an H5 virus,\" she said. The CDC's ferret study also had some sobering findings. In contrast to seasonal flu, which makes ferrets sick, but doesn't kill them, H5N1 killed all the ferrets that were infected. \"While the three cases of A(H5N1) in the United States have been mild, it is possible that there will be serious illnesses among people,\" the CDC wrote in its conclusions on the study. In the more than two dozen human infections with H5N1 virus worldwide since 2022, with the most recent iteration of the virus, there's been a wide spectrum of severity. Fourteen illnesses were severe or critical, seven were fatal, six were mild and eight didn't have any symptoms at all, according to the CDC. Dr. Seema Lakdawala, a microbiologist and immunologist at Emory University who specializes in the flu, thinks the difference in symptom severity may be due to previous exposure to seasonal viruses. Her experiments in ferrets suggest that our bodies wouldn't necessarily be totally defenseless. In her lab, ferrets with previous exposures to seasonal flu strains didn't get as sick when exposed to new flu viruses compared to those with no prior exposure to seasonal strains. She says she hasn't tested this with any of the strains involved in the cattle outbreak, however. So while we probably don't have any antibodies — the immune system's front-line soldiers — at the ready to fight off an H5 infection, there are memory cells in our tissues that might recognize parts of a new flu virus and respond. How much help we might get from past exposures to flu viruses is difficult to predict, however, which is why vaccination would still be important to tune up our immunity. Plans to stop the virus from spreading The US has vaccines against H5 viruses in its Strategic National Stockpile, and last month, government officials said 4.8 million doses are being \"filled and finished\" so they would be ready for use, though there's no plan to give them to anyone yet. Finland has already ordered 20,000 doses of a different H5 strain — H5N8 — which, will be used as soon as they're available to protect workers who might be vulnerable to the virus, such as scientists and those in direct contact with infected animals on mink farms, local officials told health and science news outlet, STAT News. For now, the CDC maintains its assessment that the risk to the general public from H5N1 is low, though people who work with infected animals have a higher risk and should wear protective clothing and take additional precautions to avoid getting sick. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, has made that protective equipment available to states for use on farms, and the USDA has made additional funding available to farms to support efforts to safeguard their livestock from disease. But so far, wearing this equipment is voluntary, and there are concerns that it might be difficult for farm workers to wear the full recommended kit, which includes coveralls, an apron, a mask, eye protection, a head covering, gloves and boots during the summer, which is again expected to break heat records. The government has also said it is working on the development of a rapid test for H5N1. Bright thinks severity of symptoms may depend on how much virus a person is exposed to when they are infected. Touching contaminated milk or the body of a dead bird and then rubbing your eyes or nose might deliver a smaller dose of the virus, and ultimately result in milder symptoms. Whereas ingesting large amounts of virus — as some animals do when they scavenge for food or as humans in some countries do when consuming dishes made with duck blood — could lead to severe disease. \"The virus is able to infect a number of internal organs. So it doesn't just locate, say, in the lungs, as we would think most influenza viruses would,\" Bright said. It's also been found in \"the brains and then the spleens, the intestines, and the heart and throughout the body of those animals.\" Dr. Richard Webby, who directs the WHO's Collaborating Centre on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, agrees. \"It's at the top of the list in terms of bad guy viruses,\" he said, noting that the virus is nerve-loving, or neurotropic. \"So it goes to the brain and causes very, very severe disease.\" Infected animals often behave strangely or aggressively. Ducks waddle in circles, twisting their necks, writhing on the ground. \"I would hate to see it in humans,\" Webby said. So far, the virus hasn't made the changes that would enable it to become a fully human pathogen, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. It's unclear whether it ever will. \"I've been a student of this virus. And I surely have been amazed at how it's changed over the course of the last 20-some years, but at the same time, you know, I'm looking for evidence that it is likely to become a virus infecting humans and then transmitted by humans to other humans. And we just haven't seen that yet,\" he added. Naniot at the Wisconsin animal rescue said they tried to save about seven infected fox kits in the summer of 2022, but all of them died. Other rescue organizations in their network had a few foxes infected with H5N1 that survived, but they ultimately went blind. While all the precautions they took to safely work with the animals were arduous, Naniot said he's grateful they were effective. They never spread the virus to any of the other animals in the facility — including themselves. \"Unfortunately, it's kind of like when Covid went through, you know, it first started someplace,\" he said. Naniot says he hasn't encountered any infected animals since 2022, but he's watching the news closely in case any cow herds become infected in Wisconsin, knowing that he could easily see H5N1 again. \"It spread kind of like wildfire, and it's a highly, highly contagious disease.\"", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "That could all change quickly, however.

{"id": "657", "fulltext": "People and public officials should be \"alert but not alarmed\" about the current bird flu outbreak, federal authorities said in a Thursday call with reporters. In two new reports, released midday Thursday, officials added details about the spread and status of the outbreak of what is formally called the \"highly pathogenic avian influenza.\" Cattle on more than 90 farms in 12 states have been infected since late last year, as well as three people who caught the disease from cattle. These infections have been widely reported. \"We should take these data we should understand them in context, and we should, as we are, be alert, but not alarmed,\" Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on the call. Eleven of the impacted farms requested funding from a federal program established to encourage cooperation with public health measures among farmers, officials said. Farm workers are the only people currently considered at high risk for bird flu, which is not likely to pose a danger to the general public unless it evolves and becomes contagious from person-to-person transmission. Right now the only means of catching the virus is direct exposure to infected animals. As more animals become infected, however, the risk becomes greater that the virus could mutate and become infectious among people. To prevent that, \"we should apply lessons learned from decreasing farm-to-farm transmission amongst poultry and apply them to dairy farms,\" Dr. Raj Panjabi, former White House Senior Director for global health security and biodefense, told USA TODAY. Slowing the outbreak of bird flu among poultry under his leadership, federal agencies instituted an approach described as \"defend the flock.\" Now, Panjabi said, we need to \"gird the herd.\" It is unclear precisely when or how the virus first infected U.S. cattle. The first incidence of the disease was confirmed on a Texas dairy farm on March 25, according to the federal study. Officials believe the virus was possibly carried from farm to farm on the clothing of workers, 20% of whom work on multiple dairy farms and 7% of whom work on poultry farms as well as at dairies. Other likely routes of transmission include the tires of vehicles used to transport people and equipment from farm to farm. Farms with the infection were linked, the report noted, because the cows were transported between farms and by a milk co-op that is shared by more than 90% of the affected dairies. Identifying these links should help the government and farmers minimize the spread of the disease, the report concluded. But the report is far from perfect, said Jennifer Nuzzo an epidemiologist who directs the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. It's more of a survey than an actual study of how the virus is being transmitted and therefore, it's hard to learn anything from it, she said. \"There are literally no data. They do not know how this is spreading,\" Nuzzo said. This lack of data is not the government's fault, she was quick to add. The U.S. Department of Agriculture relies on farms to voluntarily provide information, and, without that data, everyone is in the dark. \"Getting access to information on farms has been challenging, but it's critical for us to understand why this is spreading... so that we can prevent it from spreading,\" she said. \"I don't think there's any one farm that wants to have this. They want to protect themselves. Crucially, I want to protect the workers on those farms.\" Panjabi agrees that America won't be safe from bird flu unless farmworkers are protected. Right now, workers lack access to basic protective gear, he said and wrote in a recent opinion piece. The first worker to become infected had been wearing gloves, but not eye protection and likely got infected from touching infected hands to eyes. Farm workers are only tested for infection if they are suspected of being infected, the CDC's Shah said. Forty-five farmworkers have been tested nationwide for avian flu so far this year, Shah said, including three people who were infected. Of the first 40 tested, 35 were in Michigan, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical officer, told the Detroit Free Press. But it's not realistic to conclude that the only people infected were those who tested positive, Nuzzo said. A positive test requires a farmworker to have access to medical care or be so ill that they have no other options. Then, a caregiver has to be aware of their patient's likely exposure, recognize the potential signs of bird flu and know to send a patient sample to the CDC, she said. There are \"many points of failure,\" said Nuzzo who would like to see a vaccination begin with farmworkers so they can be protected and officials can prevent further spread. Officials in Finland recently decided to vaccinate farmworkers, veterinarians and scientists who work with avian influenza in that country. \"I don't want farmworkers to die before we suddenly decide to vaccinate\" people in the U.S., she said.

{"id": "658", "fulltext": "Agency principal deputy director wants more testing of farm workers who work in proximity to affected animals. There is not enough testing for bird flu among people and animals in the US, says Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but he is wary of pushing the issue and damaging fragile trust among farm workers and owners. \"We would like to be doing more tests,\" Shah said. \"We'd like to be testing particularly not just symptomatic workers, but anyone on a farm who is exposed.\" But, Shah said, \"Right now we want to be in a role where we're building trust with farms and farm workers.\" For the general public, the risk is still low, the CDC says. But the risks are elevated for agricultural workers in close contact with animals and potentially the people around them. The CDC is \"preparing for the possibility\" that the virus could evolve to spread more easily among people, according to a report published on Wednesday. Shah encouraged the use of personal protective equipment, but stopped short at promising shots for farm workers, who are now the most at risk for getting and spreading H5N1, a highly pathogenic bird flu. US officials announced last week that a third person tested positive, a farm worker in Michigan who worked closely with sick cows. Unlike the previous two cases, where conjunctivitis (or \"pink eye\") was the only symptom, this patient experienced respiratory symptoms typical for the flu — cough, congestion, sore throat, and watery eyes. Shah was quick to point out these symptoms don't mean the virus is changing. Symptoms like these have been common in the 888 people who have tested positive for H5N1 since 2003. \"This virus, like many viruses, can present in more than one way. And for that reason, we should remain alert, not alarmed,\" he said. But having respiratory symptoms means the individual has more opportunities to pass the virus on to other people, he said, making monitoring and testing even more important than before. Yet only 44 people have been tested in 2024, according to the CDC. While officials believe there are probably cases flying under the radar due to the lack of testing, they are closely analyzing data from influenza monitoring systems, and no red flags have been observed yet. \"We have not detected any differences in markers, like emergency room visits, in areas with affected herds compared to areas without affected herds,\" Shah said. \"Our influenza infrastructure is strong, and it's notable to discuss the ways in which it differs from our Covid infrastructure,\" he said. There are tests available throughout the country, there is a good vaccine candidate for this strain currently being manufactured, and the virus monitoring system is already well established. \"That said, we'd love to be doing more,\" he continued. Some states are now testing the blood of dairy farm workers to see how many people have antibodies against H5N1, which would give scientists a better idea of how much the virus is circulating. \"We've done these studies in poultry [workers] over the years. We'd like to replicate them now in dairy farm workers,\" Shah said. Officials have also expanded the ways people can be tested for H5N1, including eye swabs in test kits to check for conjunctivitis. These eye swabs may now be tested at local labs instead of being sent to the CDC. \"Now we don't wait until these tests are confirmed [by the CDC] before public health action is taken,\" Shah said. H5N1 continues spreading among farms, including poultry operations, with 4.2 million egg-laying chickens killed on a farm in Iowa after the virus was detected. In Idaho, alpacas tested positive on 16 May after an outbreak among poultry on the same farm, a sign that the highly pathogenic flu may be spreading from cows to poultry to other livestock, potentially accumulating mutations. The second person to test positive in the US bird flu outbreak this year showed a mutation that may make the virus spread more among mammals, genetic sequencing revealed. No genomic analysis of the third case has been announced yet. While the US Department of Agriculture announced another $824m in funding to protect livestock last week, health officials have not announced additional funds for this outbreak beyond the $101m for the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (USDA) announced in May. Part of the USDA funding has included up to $2,000 a month to farms for providing personal protective equipment, or PPE, such as N95 respirators, face shields, and goggles. The CDC has asked states to distribute personal protective equipment to farm workers from their existing supplies as well as from the strategic national stockpile. \"Thankfully, there's quite a lot of PPE available out there. Now the task is just connecting those who have PPE with those who need it,\" Shah said. But officials are mindful of the inherent difficulties of wearing, for instance, an N95 mask while working on a farm, from the wet nature of dairy farming to summer heat. \"We want our workers to be maximally protected, while at the same time not compromising their health and safety because they're overheating,\" Shah said. US officials have ordered 4.8m doses of an H5N1 vaccine they say seems well matched to this strain. It takes several months to create flu vaccines, and new formulations like this then go through regulatory processes for authorization or approval. Officials have shied away from saying who might be prioritized for the vaccines. \"There is not right now a recommendation to vaccinate farm workers,\" Shah said. \"Of course, it's under discussion. As scientists, as scientific organizations, we are always discussing what might be coming next and evaluating the pros and cons of that.\" Shah highlighted the importance of community trust in public health, especially since H5N1 is an emerging disease in livestock. Poultry producers, for example, have built up relationships with officials and regulators over decades of bird flu outbreaks. Trust is \"the most important tool that you have in your toolbox in an outbreak setting,\" Shah said. \"When H5 became a phenomenon in the poultry industry, it was not overnight that poultry farm owners, operators, as well as workers were ready to work with public health entities. That relationship took time to develop,\" Shah said. \"The same thing is under way here.\" That means being clear about what testing does and doesn't entail, and assuring the privacy of workers, he said. \"It's not something that happens overnight, but we have made progress with farms and farm owners. We want to continue that, rather than trying to overplay our hand and shatter the trust that we've created so far.\"", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "The CDC is 'preparing for the possibility' that the virus could evolve to spread more easily among people, according to a report published on Wednesday."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_4", "statement": "Our influenza infrastructure is strong, and it's notable to discuss the ways in which it differs from our Covid infrastructure."}]}
{"id": "665", "fulltext": "More than three years into a worldwide outbreak of bird flu, the virus continues to expand in the U.S., with growing impacts to food production and animals. More than 80 million chickens, thousands of wild birds and dozens of mammal species, including a polar bear, have been infected. Now it's running rampant among dairy cows, turning up in 94 herds across 12 states since March. The latest animal to test positive was an alpaca on an Idaho farm. \"It's gigantic, the scope and scale of the presence of the disease,\" said Julianna Lenoch, national coordinator for the Department of Agriculture's wildlife disease program. This scale and related concerns are reflected in the price of eggs, renewed warnings to cook ground beef and eggs thoroughly, and in extraordinary measures dairy and poultry farmers are being asked to take to prevent its spread. As the outbreak lingers and expands, it's prompting growing concerns about the risks to humans and the influence of warmer temperatures and more extreme weather events in making this and future pandemics worse. How widespread is outbreak? The highly contagious H5N1 virus has spread to six continents since the first detections in Europe and Asia in 2020. It has been reported across North and Central America and most of South America and has been found on every continent except Australia. It also turned up in Antarctica last fall raising alarm about potential consequences for some of the world's most beloved birds: penguins. The U.S. has experienced avian influenza outbreaks in the past, but this one is lasting longer and is more widespread. Domestic poultry flocks, either in commercial operations or backyard flocks and farms, have been infected in every state except Louisiana and Hawaii, including more than 5.9 million birds just since May 1. Since 2022, infections have been reported in 14 million turkeys and 80 million chickens, including 71 million egg layers. Farmers must kill chickens and turkeys when a poultry flock tests positive, and experts say the slaughter to prevent human infection has helped drive up the cost of eggs. Infected mammals have been found in 31 states, with the greatest number of infections found in foxes, mice, striped skunks, mountain lions, cats and harbor seals. Research studies find the prolonged presence and spread of the virus increases the risk of genetic mutations that could allow it to pass more easily from animals to people and among people. \"The longer we have virus out there, the more possibility there is for changes,\" said Lenoch, who oversees the federal program responsible for tracking the virus in wild birds. Can humans get bird flu? Yes, but the risk in the U.S. is still very low, federal officials reiterated in a briefing last week. They say the public should be \"alert but not alarmed.\" Since it arrived during the winter of 2021-2022, four people have tested positive in the U.S. All were exposed to the virus on farms. In the first case, in 2022, the worker was helping to cull infected poultry on a farm. All three patients this year had exposure to dairy cows. Two only reported conjunctivitis, or pink eye, while the third also experienced upper respiratory symptoms. No one in the U.S. has died from the virus, according to federal officials, but deaths have been reported internationally. So far, for the general public, everything but raw milk is considered safe, federal officials say, as long as you're cooking ground beef and eggs all the way through. Cooking takes care of any remnants of the virus that could be in egg yolks or in ground beef after once-infected dairy cows are shipped to market to be butchered. In milk, pasteurization kills the active virus so it can't be transmitted, federal research shows. However, harmless traces of the virus remain, and are found in an estimated 20% of the nation's milk supply. The Food and Drug Administration said it does not know if the virus can be transmitted in raw milk, but has asked states that allow the sale of raw milk to restrict it as a precautionary measure. \"The fact that it's in 20% of our milk supply should be disturbing to everyone because that means it's gone around already,\" said Xavier Becerra, U.S. Health and Humans Services secretary, during a speech to the Western Governors Association last week. \"If it starts to jump, that's when we really have to worry.\" Why are officials concerned about human exposure to bird flu? The great concern among federal agencies and researchers is that the virus will evolve and become more contagious among humans. For now, it's hard for humans to contract the virus and it hasn't been passed from person to person. Without stringent measures to avoid repeated viral transmission between wild and domestic animals, experts say the risks to people could grow. The Department of Agriculture and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are urging farmers to step up efforts to prevent the spread by cleaning and disinfecting equipment, especially when the same equipment is used to handle manure and feed and to better protect farm employees. Preventing farm to farm spread is \"really critical,\" agency officials said. How is this outbreak different? The outbreak is \"unique in global expansion\" and in the number of bird and mammal species that it's infecting, concluded a study published this year by Tufts University researchers Jonathan Runstadler and Wendy Puryear. \"Though the risk to humans remains low, this unexpected outbreak well illustrates the continued need for vigilance and further study,\" the study said. Avian influenza is spread globally among birds, particularly migratory waterfowl such as ducks. They're natural reservoirs and migrate over long distances, traversing hemispheres in some cases. As they travel, infected birds shed the virus in mucus, saliva, and feces. In previous outbreaks, wild birds would often get exposed and just carry the virus around with no symptoms, Lenoch said. With the current strain that has evolved, wild birds have been getting sick and dying in large groups. The virus raises many concerns, not only because of its impacts on human health and agriculture, but also because it's killing wildlife, such as seabirds, raptors and marine mammals, said Diann Prosser, a research wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Eastern Ecological Science Center. The spillover into dairy cows is rare and officials aren't certain how it started. One study released by federal officials this week said it likely started with wild birds infecting a cow in the Texas Panhandle. Cows from that herd, which weren't showing any symptoms at the time, the report stated, were shipped to Michigan, where the virus quickly spread to other states. Investigations continue. Typically, outbreaks eventually burn themselves out as wild birds build immunity and stop spreading the virus. That's expected to occur this time, as well, but it's taking longer than usual. How is bird flu spreading? Scientists don't fully understand all the methods of transmission, but most involve bird poop. Wild waterfowl are the main carriers, said Maurice Pitesky, an associate professor in cooperative extension, poultry health and food safety epidemiology at the University of California, Davis. The first four U.S. birds discovered with it were wild ducks taken by hunters in the Carolinas. Lenoch said the nation's duck hunters have been invaluable at working with officials to get wild waterfowl tested. Pitesky listed these examples of ways the bird flu virus may be transmitted: Virus spreads from wild bird poop in farm ponds or inside buildings. It can become aerosolized and passed in the air. A group of free-roaming cats died after contracting the virus from drinking raw milk and showing neurological symptoms. Animals eat infected birds. Farm employees can track in shavings or dirt that may carry the virus from wetlands and farm fields. Farm tractors and other equipment can carry infected materials between farms. Could climate change play a role? There's no single answer to the link between climate change and the bird flu outbreak in the U.S. and further studies are needed, Prosser said. On one hand, flu particles could degrade more quickly in warmer conditions, decreasing its ability to spread. However if heat waves cause changes in food resources, the virus might be able to spread more easily, she said. A vaccine was developed in 2023, with help from the Carolina Raptor Center and others, to help protect endangered California condors from bird flu, which killed 21 condors.

{"id": "670", "fulltext": "It's been nearly three months since the U.S. government announced an outbreak of the bird flu virus on dairy farms. The World Health Organization considers the virus a public health concern because of its potential to cause a pandemic, yet the U.S. has tested only about 45 people across the country. \"We're flying blind,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. With so few tests run, she said, it's impossible to know how many farmworkers have been infected, or how serious the disease is. A lack of testing means the country might not notice if the virus begins to spread between people—the gateway to another pandemic. \"We'd like to be doing more testing. There's no doubt about that,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC's bird flu test is the only one the Food and Drug Administration right now. Shah said the agency has distributed these tests to about 100 public health labs in states. \"We've got roughly a million available now,\" he said, \"and expect 1.2 million more in the next two months.\" But Nuzzo and other researchers are concerned because the CDC and public health labs aren't generally where doctors order tests from. That job tends to be done by major clinical laboratories run by companies and universities, which lack authorization for bird flu testing. Clinical labs say they're 'stuck on the bench' As the outbreak grows—with at least infected in 12 states as of June 18—researchers said the CDC and FDA are not moving fast enough to remove barriers that block clinical labs from testing. In one case, the diagnostics company Neelyx Labs was on hold with a query for more than a month. \"Clinical labs are part of the nation's public health system,\" said Alex Greninger, assistant director of the University of Washington Medicine Clinical Virology Laboratory. \"Pull us into the game. We're stuck on the bench.\" The CDC recognized the need for clinical labs in a. It calls on industry to develop tests for the H5 strain of bird flu virus, the one circulating among dairy cattle. \"The limited availability and accessibility of diagnostic tests for Influenza A(H5) poses several pain points,\" the CDC wrote. The points include a shortage of tests if demand spikes. Researchers, including former CDC director Tom Frieden and, who led the nation's response to COVID, cite as a key reason the U.S. fared so poorly with COVID. Had COVID tests been widely available in early 2020, they say, the U.S. could have detected many cases before they turned into outbreaks that prompted business shutdowns and cost lives. In published this month, Nuzzo and a group of colleagues noted that the problem wasn't testing capability but a failure to deploy that capability swiftly. The U.S. reported excess mortality eight times as high as other countries with advanced labs and other technological advantages. A COVID test vetted by the WHO was available by. Rather than use it, the United States stuck to its own multistage process, which took several months. Namely, the CDC develops its own test then sends it to local public health labs. Eventually, the FDA authorizes tests from clinical diagnostic labs that serve hospital systems, which must then scale up their operations. That took time, and people died amid outbreaks at nursing homes and prisons, waiting on test results. In contrast, South Korea immediately rolled out testing through private sector laboratories, allowing it to keep schools and businesses open. \"They said, 'Gear up, guys; we're going to need a ton of tests,'\" said Frieden, now president of the public health organization Resolve to Save Lives. \"You need to get commercials in the game.\" Nuzzo and her colleagues describe a step-by-step strategy for rolling out testing in health emergencies, in response to mistakes made obvious by COVID. But in this bird flu outbreak, the U.S. is weeks behind that playbook. Ample testing is critical for two reasons. First, people need to know if they're infected so that they can be quickly treated, Nuzzo said. Over the past two decades, roughly half of about 900 people around the globe known to have gotten the bird flu died from it. Although the three farmworkers diagnosed with the disease this year in the United States had only mild symptoms, like a runny nose and inflamed eyes, others may not be so lucky. The flu treatment Tamiflu works only when given soon after symptoms start. The CDC and local health departments have tried to boost bird flu testing among farmworkers, asking them to be tested if they feel sick. list several reasons why their outreach efforts are failing. The outreach might not be in the languages the farmworkers speak, for example, or address such concerns as a loss of employment. If people who live and work around farms simply see a doctor when they or their children fall ill, those cases could be missed if the doctors send samples to their usual clinical laboratories. The CDC has asked doctors to send samples from people with flu symptoms who have exposure to livestock or poultry to public health labs. \"If you work on a farm with an outbreak and you're worried about your welfare, you can get tested,\" Shah said. But sending samples to public health departments requires knowledge, time, and effort. \"I really worry about a testing scheme in which busy clinicians need to figure this out,\" Nuzzo said. Labs ask for 'right to reference' but federal agencies' response is slow The other reason to involve clinical laboratories is so the nation can ramp up testing if the bird flu is suddenly detected among people who didn't catch it from cattle. There's no evidence the virus has started to spread among people, but that could change The fastest way to get clinical labs involved, Greninger said, is to allow them to use a test the FDA has already authorized: the CDC's bird flu test. On April 16 the CDC opened up that possibility by offering royalty-free licenses for components of its bird flu tests to accredited labs. Several commercial labs asked for licenses. \"We want to get prepared before things get crazy,\" said Shyam Saladi, chief executive officer of the diagnostics company Neelyx Labs, which offered COVID and mpox tests during shortages in those outbreaks. His experience over the past two months reveals the types of barriers that prevent labs from moving swiftly. In email exchanges with the CDC, shared with KFF Health News, Saladi specifies the labs' desire for licenses relevant to the CDC's test, as well as a \"right to reference\" the CDC's data in its application for FDA authorization. That \"right to reference\" makes it easier for one company to use a test developed by another. It allows the new group to skip certain analyses conducted by the original maker, by telling the FDA to look at data in the original FDA application. This was commonplace with COVID tests at the peak of the pandemic. At first, the CDC appeared eager to cooperate. \"A right of reference to the data should be available,\" Jonathan Motley, a patent specialist at the CDC, wrote in an email to Saladi on April 24. Over the next few weeks, the CDC sent him information about transferring its licenses to the company, and about the test, which prompted Neelyx's researchers to buy testing components and try out the CDC's process on their equipment. But Saladi grew increasingly anxious about the ability to reference the CDC's data in the company's FDA application. \"Do you have an update with respect to the right of reference?\" he asked the CDC on May 13. \"If there are any potential sticking points with respect to this, would you mind letting us know please?\" He asked several more times in the following weeks, as the number of herds infected with the bird flu ticked upward and more cases among farmworkers were announced. \"Given that it is May 24 and the outbreak has only expanded, can CDC provide a date by which it plans to respond?\" Saladi wrote. The CDC eventually signed a licensing agreement with Neelyx but informed Saladi that it would not, in fact, provide the reference. Without that, Saladi said, he could not move forward with the CDC's test—at least not without more material from the agency. \"It's really frustrating,\" he said. \"We thought they really intended to support the development of these tests in case they are needed.\" Shah, from the CDC, said test manufacturers should generate their own data to prove that they're using the CDC's test correctly. \"We don't have a shortage such that we need to cut corners,\" he said. \"Quality reigns supreme.\" The CDC has given seven companies, including Neelyx, licenses for its tests—although none have been cleared to use them by the FDA. Only one of those companies asked for the right of reference, Shah said. The labs may be assisted by additional material that the agency is developing now, to allow them to complete the analyses—even without the reference. \"This should have happened sooner,\" Saladi told KFF Health News when he was told about the CDC's pending additional material. \"There's been no communication about this.\" Flashback to early COVID response Greninger said the delays and confusion are reminiscent of the early months of COVID, when federal agencies prioritized caution over speed. Test accuracy is important, he said, but excessive vetting can cause harm in a fastmoving outbreak like this one. \"The CDC should be trying to open this up to labs with national reach and a good reputation,\" he said. \"I fall on the side of allowing labs to get ready—that's a no-brainer.\" Clinical laboratories have also begun to develop their own tests from scratch. But researchers said they're moving cautiously because of a recent that gives the agency more oversight of lab-developed tests, lengthening the pathway to approval. In an email to KFF Health News, FDA press officer Janell Goodwin said the rule's enforcement will occur gradually. However, Susan Van Meter, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, a trade group whose members include the nation's largest commercial diagnostic labs, said companies need more clarity: \"It's slowing things down because it's adding to the confusion about what is allowable.\" Creating tests for the bird flu is already a risky bet because demand is uncertain. It's not clear whether this outbreak in cattle will trigger an epidemic or fizzle out. In addition to issues with the CDC and FDA, clinical laboratories are trying to figure out whether health will pay for bird flu tests. These wrinkles will be smoothed eventually. Until then, the vanishingly slim numbers of people tested, along with the lack of testing in cattle, may draw criticism from other parts of the world. \"Think about our judgment of China's transparency at the start of COVID,\" Nuzzo said. \"The current situation undermines America's standing in the world.\" is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

{"id": "678", "fulltext": "Three months since an outbreak of avian influenza in U.S. dairy cattle was declared, the country is failing to take the necessary steps to get in front of the virus and possibly contain its spread among cows, according to interviews with more than a dozen experts and current and former government officials. The country still does not have a sufficient testing infrastructure in place, nor a full understanding of how the virus is moving within herds and to new herds, experts say. Government officials also have not secured the cooperation from farmers and dairy workers that would be required to rein in the outbreak. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has stated that its goal is to eliminate the virus, known as H5N1, from cattle. But that messaging has left scientists scratching their heads about how exactly officials plan to stop further transmission given that the impediments persist. It's also not clear whether the virus could burn out, or if cows are vulnerable to reinfection. 'If that was the goal, we should have been doing a lot of other things from the beginning,' said Seema Lakdawala, an influenza expert at Emory University. 'We could have been working toward that for the last three months, rather than trying to play catch-up now.' Other countries are taking notice. Last month, a committee of scientific advisers alerted the French government to the 'unprecedented situation' happening 4,000 miles away, saying that while the start of the virus's spread among cows had not yet increased the threat to people, it was concerning enough that the government needed to take its own measures. 'The situation is serious,' Bruno Lina, a virologist and member of the committee, told STAT, noting that European countries were already expanding their surveillance systems to include cows. 'It has to be taken seriously in the U.S., and that is what we expect from the U.S.' But by just about all accounts, not enough is being done. USDA maintained that its scientists, veterinarians, and animal health experts 'have been working at all hours, day in and day out' to respond to the virus. The agency also said as it continues to increase outreach to raise awareness of the programs USDA has started, the agency expects testing to increase in the weeks ahead. 'The actions we have taken to limit movements, improve biosecurity and encourage testing are expected to establish the foundation for eliminating this virus from the dairy herd,' the agency said in a written statement provided to STAT. The USDA said the agency is 'taking animal health and human health concerns seriously through a whole-of-government response.' Agency officials first announced the virus had infected dairy herds on March 25, though it's perhaps been seven months since the outbreak actually started. FURTHER READING Go deeper: H5N1 bird flu Here are the bird flu questions top scientists would like to see answered. Michigan is doing more bird flu testing than any other state. Will others follow? Producing a H5N1 vaccine is more complicated than you might think. And the world would need a lot of it. And finally, an important avian flu precaution: Don't drink raw milk. To gauge the risk of the situation and assess the response, STAT spoke with a range of experts both in the U.S. and internationally. What emerges is a portrait of a threat that is steadily rolling along, yet also settling into what feels like a routine. Nearly every day, a few new herds are found to have infections, entrenching the virus deeper into the cattle population and expanding its footprint across more states. As of Tuesday, 126 herds in 12 states have reported infections, although those figures are widely assumed to be underestimates because many farmers are refusing to test. Three farmworkers, in Texas and Michigan, are known to have developed mild cases of H5N1, presumably from close contact with cows. But if the dynamics of the outbreak haven't changed, neither, experts say, has the forcefulness of the response. While the situation presents both scientific and logistical challenges, a chief concern is that neither the government nor outside scientists know just how far and wide the virus has spread because critical data have either not been collected or transparently relayed. The government still does not have an adequate surveillance system in place to keep up with the outbreak, scientists say. Agricultural authorities are still releasing only partial data from the genetic sequences of the viruses they've sampled. There is not widespread testing of cows or of workers on dairy farms, leading to fears of missed infections, both bovine and human. Broad serology studies of either cows or people which could detect antibodies to H5N1 in blood and provide an estimate of the true scope of infections have yet to release results, though at least one is underway in Michigan. These are all complaints that experts have been lodging for weeks, if not longer. The failure to address them, they say, is hamstringing efforts to track the virus, to contain its spread in cattle, and to see if it's adapting in ways that could make it more likely to jump to people. 'If you still can't determine the scale of the outbreak, and which states, what farms, what herds, are actually being affected, I don't see how you can possibly think that it's containable,' said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan. USDA said that the agency provided sequencing data immediately to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has made information publicly available. The agency also said it has sent epidemiological strike teams to Michigan and Iowa at the states' requests. Even if the outbreak seems to be following a pattern, that might not always be the case. Scientists note that H5N1 bird flu has forced regular rewrites to flu dogma since it emerged as a risk to people nearly three decades ago. 'It doesn't appear that the overall animal outbreak is changing in character, as of yet, but it's difficult to know because we have so little data,' said Tom Inglesby, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who, like several experts, argued that if this outbreak were playing out in another country, U.S. officials would be calling the response unacceptable.

Note: Layout incorporates two CDC transmission electron micrographs that have been inverted, repositioned, and colorized by NIAID. Scale has been modified. Three H5N1 bird flu virus particles. The strain emerged as a risk to people nearly three decades ago, but a newer clade seems to have heightened the threat. CDC AND NIAID Limited measures, reluctant farmers Over the past few months, authorities have rolled out a number of interventions, trying, for example, to bolster protections for dairy workers and incentivize farms to expand surveillance. They've put up some money for farms to improve biosecurity measures and widen testing, though only a fraction of farms, including those with infected herds, have taken the government up on its offer. States are trying to give away personal protective equipment that could be worn in milking parlors, but again, few farms have expressed interest. Within a month of the identification of the outbreak, federal authorities started requiring testing of lactating dairy cows, though only when they crossed state lines, and even then, only a limited number per shipment, chosen by the farmer. Agencies are trying to widen their approach. The CDC has started publicly tracking influenza A viruses the family to which H5N1 belongs in wastewater samples. And states are taking their own steps beyond quarantining infected herds. In Iowa, for example, agricultural authorities have started requiring testing of dairy cows around infected poultry flocks. Several states are requiring lactating cows to be tested for flu before they can be brought to fairs. But the government's own data indicate the efforts have holes large enough for the virus to run through. In one USDA survey, 60% of farms acknowledged moving cows within a state even after the animals had started showing symptoms of infection. Federal officials have acknowledged they're not getting much cooperation from dairy producers and workers. 'The more we learn about H5N1, the more we understand that good biosecurity is a critically important path to containing the virus,' Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack wrote last week in an op-ed in the media outlet Agri-Pulse, calling on farmers to step up the use of PPE, limit traffic onto their farms, and increase cleaning and disinfection practices in their barns and milking parlors. 'It's not [being] managed as a zoonotic disease that is a potential dynamic threat. It may well not become a pandemic. But I think it's playing with fire.' MARION KOOPMANS, CHIEF OF VIROSCIENCE AT ERASMUS MEDICAL CENTER H5N1 has been on scientists' radars as a threat since the late 1990s, and over the years, it has managed to spill from wild birds into different mammalian species, causing infections that seemed more like one-offs. But an H5N1 strain that emerged a few years ago seemed to change the game. It has been carried by migratory birds to just about every corner of the world, decimating poultry flocks along the way and infecting more and more mammals. This version of the virus is the one that is transmitting among dairy cows. The ongoing spread among cows raises particular concerns, not limited to the economic toll the virus could take on farmers by depleting cows' milk or by preventing them from selling product. As the virus has spread, so too have fears that it could become an endemic pathogen in a species that has considerable contact with people, creating a lasting risk to dairy workers. Underlying it all is the grave concern that the virus could one day evolve in ways that make it better at spreading to and among people. The virus is not there yet, and scientists say it would likely need to change in a number of ways for that to happen. But they believe the nature of the current spread could conceivably lay the groundwork for the next pandemic. Historically, the virus has had an alarmingly high fatality rate when it has caused human infections, though all three documented human cases that have emerged from the cattle outbreak have been mild. 'It's not [being] managed as a zoonotic disease that is a potential dynamic threat,' said Marion Koopmans, chief of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. 'It may well not become a pandemic. But I think it's playing with fire.'

ROBERT F. BUKATY/AP Familiar hurdles In some ways, experts say, the bird flu outbreak is exposing the same systemic obstacles that hobbled the U.S. performance during the Covid-19 pandemic. The response is falling on various local, state, and federal agencies with limited authorities and disparate, sometimes competing, agendas. In this case, it's a balkanization compounded by the need for public health officials to collaborate with agricultural agencies, which are often tilted to supporting industry instead of prioritizing reining in threats to human health. State agricultural agencies are also underfunded and understaffed; meanwhile, some portion of the public is resistant to measures to track and control the virus. 'There seems to be a lot of issues between the agencies, the federal government, the states, the farmers,' said Florian Krammer, a flu virologist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine in New York. 'It's not looking like everybody's on the same side trying to get rid of the problem.' Many scientists acknowledge the tightrope that government officials are treading. Fearful of overstepping, agencies are reluctant to use the full extent of their legal authority to demand testing on farms something that could lead to a political backlash in an election year. Such a response would be perhaps all the more likely in a post-Covid pandemic world, and would impede whatever receptiveness farmers are showing. H5N1 chart 0625 HELEN BRANSWELL/STAT Beyond the mistrust of government agencies some farmers harbor, dairy producers, working with slim margins to begin with, have real economic concerns. If they report an infected herd, they can't sell milk or move cattle, which are frequently transported for breeding and grazing. Veterinarians who have been working with farmers told STAT that while some infected herds have been cleared to return to milk production, farmers still fear what a positive test means for them. Given the risks, it's easier not to test. 'Even though I'm disappointed by some of the things the federal government is doing, I understand the constraints they're working under,' said Andrew Pavia, the chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah, who also works on public health preparedness. 'And even though I'm disappointed by some of the barriers that farm associations and farmers are throwing up, I understand where they're coming from. I think we need to work together to figure it out.' Related: USDA, FDA turf battles hamper responses to outbreaks like H5N1 bird flu Thorny challenges stand in the way of looking for human cases as well. Private farms might not give public health agencies access, and even if they do, dairy workers might dodge testing. A positive test could mean missing work and lost income. Many farmworkers do not speak English, and may not have health insurance. A portion are presumed to be in the country illegally, aspects that discourage cooperation with health investigations. Public health officials have made clear they've run into these problems. A study of the first human case tied to the outbreak a Texas dairy worker who developed conjunctivitis reported that the man and his contacts refused to have their blood drawn for serology tests, which could have shown whether others were infected. As of mid-June, just over 50 people had been tested for novel influenza strains, which would include H5N1, according to the CDC's most recent figures. 'Do they get time off when they're sick? If not, will they be willing to come forward to declare themselves feeling ill?' Laszlo Madaras, the chief medical officer of the Migrant Clinicians Network, said during a webinar last week for rural providers, whom he stressed could be trusted sources of information for dairy workers. Aerial view of the Sunrise Farms processing plant in Petaluma, Calif. There is not widespread testing of cows or of workers on dairy farms, leading to fears of missed infections, both bovine and human. TERRY CHEA/AP Possible ways forward Such dynamics give rise to the question of what an effective response should look like one that coaxes greater participation from farms, improves surveillance, and fits with what agencies are empowered to do. Several experts said state and federal agencies, as well as rural doctors and veterinarians, need to conduct education campaigns, both to outline steps that dairy workers can take to prevent infections, and to explain to farmers how being transparent can help protect herds and the safety of the milk supply. Whatever steps are being proposed, they said, producers have to get on board if they're to succeed. 'Unless you've got 80% of the industry in a position to support you, you don't have the manpower, or the dollars, to dictate what you're going to do,' said John Korslund, who worked as a USDA veterinarian for two decades. 'So it's very much a cooperative effort. And if you're not in a position where you can get cooperation from the industry with what you're proposing to do, you can't do it.' USDA said the agency is working with the food and agriculture sector and 'hand in glove' with state health officials to raise awareness about available resources. The agency has been hosting regular meetings to share updates and hear concerns, a spokesperson said. The trust gap with farmers has continued even though some federal officials are well-connected to the dairy industry. Vilsack, for example, used to be a top-paid executive at Dairy Management, a trade association that promotes milk and dairy products. 'He's shown time and again that he's on the side of farmers, and, you know, particularly dairy farmers, right?' said Brian Ronholm, Consumer Reports' director of food policy and a former USDA food safety official. 'So if anyone can kind of reach that divide, it is someone like him.' Other ideas that experts called for included bulk testing of milk, which could narrow geographically where new outbreaks are occurring. So far, that is only being done voluntarily, by a tiny number of farms. Many said there needs to be testing of asymptomatic cows, as well as those showing signs of illness. Some scientists are arguing for vaccinating cows, though that is still a point of debate. A USDA spokesperson said that the bulk milk testing is in its 'initial pilot phase' and that six states are enrolled as of Tuesday: Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas, Ohio, and North Carolina. The agency is conducting outreach to provide more information about the program, the spokesperson said. Some experts pointed to measures other countries are taking even though no other country has documented a cattle infection as steps that could help the U.S. get ahead of the virus. 'There seems to be a lot of issues between the agencies, the federal government, the states, the farmers. It's not looking like everybody's on the same side trying to get rid of the problem.' FLORIAN KRAMMER, FLU VIROLOGIST Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist at Erasmus Medical Center, noted that Canada has made it mandatory to report suspected H5N1 cases in cows; in the U.S., only positive tests have to be reported to federal authorities. (Some states have also said suspected cases need to be reported.) Researchers in Germany have made public early results from serology studies in cows. It's also a matter of money, many experts said. The government might simply need to pony up more resources both as a way to get access to farms for testing and to cover farmers' losses if they have an infected herd and can't sell milk. Experts noted that the government pays poultry farmers for birds that need to be culled to contain H5N1 outbreaks in domestic flocks. A program to cover some portion of lost milk production has been announced, but authorities are still ironing out the details. The program will be retroactive to the date herds were confirmed positive, the USDA said. 'USDA anticipates that its forthcoming rule will specify that farmers will receive payments at 90 percent of lost production per cow,' an agency spokesperson said. Ultimately, though, there are constraints on the incentives agencies can offer. The Biden administration isn't likely to get any additional funding from a Congress split between Democrats and Republicans. Multiple senators said in brief interviews with STAT that administration officials haven't asked for more resources. John Auerbach, a former CDC official during the Obama and Biden administrations who is now a public health consultant at the firm ICF, said the administration's reticence to ask for more money is not surprising, given the difficulty that Congress has had simply keeping the government open. 'I understand why the Democrats would be reluctant to open that can of worms up again,' Auerbach said. The USDA reiterated that the agency has approved a transfer of $824 million from a separate funding stream to support response efforts. The secretary of agriculture can authorize additional funding to address emergency outbreaks, like a previous $1.3 billion tranche approved to increase detection of avian influenza in wild birds and poultry. The repeated use of milking equipment from cow to cow seems to be a key route of H5N1 transmission. ARIANA DREHSLER/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES A unified approach Fundamentally, experts said, the U.S. needs a more coordinated response instead of the piecemeal approach it's seen so far. 'It only takes one state to be doing a really bad job or to be covering up or something for it to then be getting into further states, and the outbreak carries on,' said Thomas Peacock, an influenza virologist at the Pirbright Institute, a British organization that focuses on controlling viral illnesses in animals. For all the political and economic challenges, scientists have plenty of questions to answer as well. For one, there is still not a comprehensive understanding of the way, or ways, the virus is spreading. The repeated use of milking equipment from cow to cow seems to be a key route, but scientists think there have to be other, undiscovered viral pathways that haven't been specified beyond the movement of equipment, cows, and people from farm to farm. The scientific specifics of this outbreak are also complicating the response. Many of the world's top flu scientists have acknowledged they didn't think cows could get H5N1, a blind spot that delayed pinpointing the virus as the culprit behind a decline in milk production among cows in the Texas Panhandle. And while other mammals, with a few exceptions, haven't spread H5N1 to others of their species, it seems the virus is moving quite efficiently from cow to cow, though likely with human help, via milking equipment. The challenges go on. Cows, generally, aren't getting that sick. The three related human cases have all been mild. It's easy for those types of incidents to be ignored or missed, giving the virus a chance to spread silently. Related: Getting farmworkers to use PPE is hard, but it's the best way to stop an H5N1 bird flu epidemic Scientists credited the government with policy changes that haven't earned many headlines but that they say are helpful. A tweak in how the USDA classifies H5N1 has allowed additional researchers to study the virus, Emory's Lakdawala said. (They still need a USDA permit and must conduct the work in a high-containment lab.) More scientists are now trying to crack open some of the basics of the virus how it spreads, how it's evolving, the quality and durability of immunity and it's made it more feasible to do wastewater monitoring for the virus. The CDC is also flagging to health care providers the possibility of human cases. The agency has encouraged clinicians to test people for flu even though in the summer the usual human flu strains transmit at very low levels. 'It's really important when you're seeing a patient that might have acute respiratory illness or conjunctivitis, whether or not they have a fever, even if they appear to have clinically mild illness, you should ask them what they do,' Tim Uyeki, the chief medical officer of the CDC's influenza division, said on the webinar for rural clinicians. 'What kind of work do they do? Do they have potential occupational exposure to an infected animal?' To some scientists, the situation on dairy farms is not some new threat, but rather an extension of one that's been building as H5N1 has swept around the world. While the outbreak stoked particular concerns such as cows' close contact with people, and the risk to the milk supply they argued that the latest event has only highlighted how important it is for the world to give more attention to the virus broadly. 'Arguably, the global spread of this virus over the last four years the fact that it has been jumping from species to species quite happily to me, that already felt like a big enough call to arms,' said Colin Russell, an evolutionary biologist at Amsterdam University Medical Center and chair of a European network of influenza experts. 'We have to be very careful in the presentation of this, not as, 'Oh it's in cattle, now there's going to be a pandemic,' but more that this is just a further illustration of the potential of this virus and the fact that we need to be taking the whole H5 situation seriously, globally,' he said.

{"id": "681", "fulltext": "Daily text messages and phone calls check on farm workers who work with cows that have tested positive for H5N1. As questions swirl about the spread of bird flu among livestock and people, one US state—Michigan—has taken the lead on monitoring and studying the outbreak. Other states have seemed wary of tracking cases among animals and people, but Michigan has taken a proactive approach, with daily text messages and phone calls to check on farm workers who work with cows that have tested positive for H5N1. They also have offered free tests if symptoms develop. Officials weren’t surprised when a third person tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza, and they weren’t surprised that it happened in Michigan. Nearly two-thirds of the people being monitored for H5N1 symptoms are in Michigan, Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said recently. As of 22 May, 35 out of 40 tests among people had been conducted in Michigan. That means only five other bird flu tests took place in other states, including Texas, the only other state to report a case among humans in this outbreak. Michigan is the state with the highest concentration of influenza A in its wastewater, according to WastewaterScan. H5N1 belongs to the influenza A family, and relatively high levels of flu A indicate possible outbreaks of H5N1—most likely among animals. But that’s not the only reason Michigan keeps coming up in news about bird flu. “I don’t think we’re the only state that has cases. I think we’re the only state that is detecting our cases,” other than Texas, said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive for the state of Michigan. “It gives me hope that the system is working here.” It’s not just testing and monitoring. Michigan also invited epidemiologists from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to study transmission of the virus. The authors of a recent USDA report thanked Michigan dairy producers for their openness and transparency. “This report could not have been completed without them,” the researchers wrote. Michigan officials announced new biosecurity rules for farms following the first detection of bird flu in cows, and soon began promoting seasonal flu vaccines among dairy and poultry workers to prevent the possibility of flu variants mixing together and causing more serious illness. Michigan also announced additional funding for flu-affected farms, beyond the federal assistance available. Up to 20 farms affected by H5N1 may receive as much as $28,000 for participating in studies and working with health officials. “Michigan has been doing a lot of work to really understand what’s going on with H5N1,” said Marisa Eisenberg, associate professor of epidemiology and co-director of the Michigan Public Health Integrated Center for Outbreak Analytics and Modeling at the University of Michigan. “Some of what we’re seeing is just that when you look for something, that’s how you find it.” It’s important for state and local officials to work closely with agricultural industries—covering cows, chickens, pigs and other potentially affected animals—to understand how transmission is happening and how to stop it, experts said. “It’s to everyone’s benefit to try and be as proactive as you can,” Eisenberg said. “Because if you put your head in the sand, ostrich-style, then it will continue to spread and continue to cause a wider range of problems—from a public health perspective, from a milk-production and economic perspective.” In Michigan, that approach has involved checking in regularly with farm workers for symptoms, and working closely with officials from state and local agriculture and health departments. “We’re seeing how human health and animal health are inextricably linked and making sure that we are approaching these things together,” Bagdasarian said. Farm owners and workers who are in contact with sick cows receive daily text messages or phone calls to check for even mild or unusual symptoms. Those who report any symptoms are tested for H5N1 and, in the cases of two people who tested positive, offered antivirals. That program, Eisenberg said, “has been really helpful in terms of finding the two cases that we’ve seen so far, and also encouraging testing from farms and from dairies in particular.” One Michigan worker who tested positive developed conjunctivitis, or pinkeye, after milk from a sick cow splashed into the person’s eyes. The other worker developed more typical flu symptoms, including a cough, congestion, a sore throat and watery eyes, after working in close quarters with a sick cow. The risk of bird flu to most people is still low, but anyone in close contact with potentially sick animals should take precautions, officials say. “It really highlights how helpful personal protective equipment can be for individuals who are having prolonged exposure to sick animals,” Bagdasarian said. But such protective equipment can be difficult to wear while working on a farm, amid conditions like summer heat and splashing from water and milk. “One of the big concerns has been visibility,” Bagdasarian said. “When you’re working with a large animal and there’s risk for injury, anything that blocks your vision can also be difficult to use.” Officials in Michigan are being careful not to disclose details that might identify affected farms or individuals while also announcing new cases. “Michigan as a state has been pretty good at navigating the concerns around privacy and not wanting to identify farms specifically, but also wanting to share data in a transparent way,” Eisenberg said. Throughout this bird flu outbreak, officials have emphasized the importance of trust. “One of the things we learned in Covid is that you need to have established relationships before there is any sort of public health emergency,” Bagdasarian said. “We have a lot of health clinics and outreach staff who work directly with farm workers, and the local health departments know the farms in their jurisdictions.” If an H5N1 vaccine becomes available for people, it could fall prey to some of the same politicization and misinformation around vaccines that accelerated during the pandemic, she said—including lower uptake of the seasonal flu vaccine. “We are still working to re-establish that public trust,” Bagdasarian said. The bird flu outbreak is “concerning, but we can’t yet say whether it’s going to really become a major problem that the public at large needs to worry about,” Eisenberg said. “It’s enough of a concern that we should certainly be doing everything we can to make sure that it doesn’t turn into a bigger problem.”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "deny_statement_2", "statement": "The bird flu outbreak is 'concerning, but we can’t yet say whether it’s going to really become a major problem that the public at large needs to worry about,' Eisenberg said."}]}
{"id": "685", "fulltext": "Bird flu snapshot: This is the latest installment in a series of regular updates on H5N1 avian flu that STAT is publishing on Monday mornings. To read future updates you can also subscribe to STAT's Morning Rounds newsletter. When pathologist Thijs Kuiken looks at what's happening in the U.S. response to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak in dairy cows, he's reminded of a difficult period in the Netherlands, where he lives, back in the late aughts. Large goat and sheep farms in the country were hit with outbreaks of what is known as Q fever every year from 2007 to 2010. The disease, caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii, primarily affects ruminants sheep, goats, and cows. But people can contract it too. Some don’t get sick. Some have flu-like illness and recover. But some develop chronic Q fever syndrome, a debilitating condition. Hundreds of people in the Netherlands still suffer from the condition as a consequence of the 2007-2010 epidemics. H5N1 is a virus that scientists fear might one day trigger a pandemic; Q fever is a bacterial disease that when present in an environment can lead to significant numbers of infections in people. But the similarity Kuiken sees is how, in both cases, the initial inclination is to treat these events in animals as an economic problem for the agricultural sector, rather than as an agricultural problem that could have large human health consequences as well. “My overall concern about this outbreak is that it’s being treated too much as an economic problem and too little as a public health and an animal health problem,” said Kuiken, who works in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy Kuiken is one of the influenza experts STAT spoke to for an article last week analyzing the response to the H5N1 outbreak in cows to date. He and others worry about the lack of urgency in the U.S. response and the apparent absence of a comprehensive plan for driving the virus out of cattle. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack believes the answer is better biosecurity on farms. But with the number of affected farms continuing to rise the figure hit 139 in 12 states at the end of last week and those are the farms where farmers actually allowed testing to take place there is no sense that the tide is turning. (The USDA’s count was 133 on Friday, which did not include the two latest detections in Iowa and four newest in Colorado.) Letting H5N1 become established in cows would give the virus a chance to adapt to a mammalian species, increasing the risk it would acquire mutations that would help it become capable of spreading to and among people. The response to the Q fever outbreaks was similar, Kuiken said: “At the beginning it was treated mainly as an economic problem and a problem of the dairy goat sector and was dealt with by the ministry of agriculture.” Infected animals shed large amounts of the bacteria in their milk, urine, feces, and placentas; the infections induced “abortion storms” on farms with pregnant animals, Kuiken said. The bacteria wafted off the farms in the wind. “There were people who would cycle by these farms and become infected.” But the locations of affected farms were not publicly disclosed, for privacy reasons. (Sound familiar?) “So even if people were concerned that they might get infected and wanted to keep away from these areas, they did not know where they were,” he said. Eventually the country’s health minister stepped in to demand that the outbreaks be treated also as a human health problem. “It really was an important lesson for the veterinary and medical authorities,” Kuiken said. At present in the H5N1 outbreak, control over the response lies firmly in the hands of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Though there have been numerous reports of sick farmworkers many more than the three who have tested positive for H5N1 in this outbreak to date few have been tested. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday that at least 53 people have been tested for the virus since the outbreak was first detected. That figure was 51 at the end of the week before last. Efforts to try to get a handle on how many people may have been infected have been stymied because in many cases farmers have refused to allow public health workers on their properties to talk to and test their workers. But finally, there’s been a breakthrough on this front: Health authorities in Michigan are conducting a small serology study, with the cooperation of an undisclosed number of farms in that state. Participating workers are filling in questionnaires describing their encounters with cows and their daily duties, and are giving a blood sample that will be analyzed for antibodies to the virus. The CDC is collaborating with Michigan on the study. Another study that is getting underway is part two of a Food and Drug Administration effort to assess the risk H5N1 virus poses to commercial milk production. In early May the agency reported that of nearly 300 store-bought milk samples, about 1 in 5 contained fragments of bird flu viruses, but the viruses had been killed by pasteurization. (The FDA and USDA released a preprint a study that hasn’t yet gone through peer review on Friday showing that commercial pasteurization techniques reduce virus in milk to undetectable levels.) Part two of the milk study will focus on some milk products the first iteration didn’t test, Don Prater, the FDA’s acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, told journalists last week. They include: cream cheese, aged raw milk cheese, butter, and ice cream. Results are some weeks off, he said. Coming sooner today, in fact USDA will start taking applications for an assistance plan to compensate farmers for lost income due to reduced milk production in H5N1-infected cows. With money to cover losses actually on the table, it’s hoped farmers will finally see a reason to test animals they suspect are infected with the virus.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_3", "statement": "But my overall concern about this outbreak is that it’s being treated too much as an economic problem and too little as a public health and an animal health problem."}, {"key": "affirm_statement_4", "statement": "H5N1 is a virus that scientists fear might one day trigger a pandemic."}]}
{"id": "691", "fulltext": "(CNN) — A fourth person in the United States has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak among dairy cattle across the country. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced Wednesday that it has identified the state's first human case of H5 avian influenza associated with the multi-state outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle. This case is the fourth identified nationally in connection to the ongoing outbreak. Previously, two human cases have been reported in Michigan and one in Texas. More than a quarter of dairy herds in Colorado have reported cases of bird flu, according to data from the state health department. As of Wednesday, federal data shows that seven states have confirmed cases in the past 30 days, and 40% of them are in Colorado — more than any other state. The infected person in Colorado had mild symptoms, reporting only conjunctivitis, or pink eye, as a symptom, according to state health officials. He worked at a dairy farm in northeast Colorado and had direct exposure to dairy cattle infected with avian flu. After testing positive, the man was treated immediately with the antiviral medication oseltamivir and he has recovered, according to the state health department. \"The risk to most people remains low. Avian flu viruses are currently spreading among animals, but they are not adapted to spread from person to person. Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals,\" Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist at the CDPHE, said in Wednesday's announcement. The last human case of H5N1 in Colorado was in 2022 in a person who was exposed to infected poultry. In the current outbreak connected to infected dairy cattle, the first two human cases identified in the United States also reported eye-related symptoms and eye infections or conjunctivitis. The third human case in the US reported more respiratory symptoms, such as cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes. None of those three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission of the virus. On the national level, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that it continues to monitor the situation carefully, using its flu surveillance systems to watch for H5N1 activity in people. On Wednesday, the CDC said that the human case in Colorado \"does not change CDC's current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low.\" However, the case \"underscores the importance of recommended precautions in people with exposure to infected animals,\" according to the CDC. \"People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.\" The CDC repeatedly has recommended that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them. CDC officials announced Tuesday that the United States has enough H5 bird flu tests to respond to the current outbreak. \"We have an ample number of H5-specific tests in the public health system for the current outbreak. As of right now, there are roughly 750,000 H5-specific tests available today and another 1.2 million such tests coming online in the next two to three months,\" Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said in a news conference Tuesday. \"This is on top of a robust supply of influenza A tests, the general tests that are available at doctor's offices around the country,\" Shah said. \"The way that our system works is such that if someone tests positive for influenza A at the doctor's office, their specimen is sent to a public health laboratory for what's called subtyping. That tells us if the influenza A virus is a common seasonal one, or a rarer version like H5N1. That subtyping happens more commonly than you might think.\" CNN's Deidre McPhilips contributed to this report.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "deny_statement_2", "statement": "On Wednesday, the CDC said that the human case in Colorado 'does not change CDC's current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low.'"}]}
{"id": "707", "fulltext": "As Covid-19 swept across the United States, schools were among the most highly affected public spaces. To prepare for a potential H5N1 avian influenza jump to humans, schools need to be preparing for the scenario now before a sustained transmission event occurs. The response to Covid-19, which first appeared in the U.S. in early 2020, has been scrutinized by numerous case studies, after-action reports, and Congressional fact-finding hearings. Despite the federal government investing billions of dollars to improve public health infrastructure and efforts to streamline red tape through the new White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, significant challenges remain. While these efforts suggest that the U.S. should be better prepared for the next pandemic, recent warnings from experts give pause for concern. Robert Redfield, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recently predicted that avian flu will cause a pandemic. Seth Berkley, the former CEO of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, derided the shocking ineptitude of the U.S. response to the avian flu outbreak among dairy cattle. While these are individual opinions, they represent a growing sense of alarm among public health scientists that the H5N1 avian flu virus, which first infected humans in 1997, is developing characteristics that allow it to infect mammals more efficiently. With enough time and enough bad luck, the ability of this virus to infect and spread more efficiently between humans could be next. These warnings highlight a critical need for a more robust and adaptable plan, especially for protecting children and schools, severely affected by the faults in the Covid-19 pandemic response. Related: Congress extends some pandemic preparedness programs, but not all The problem is that the Pandemic Influenza Plan public health officials would likely turn to in the event H5N1 bird flu jumps to humans is the same as the playbook used for Covid-19. It didn't work then for K-12 schools, and won't work now. Policymakers, public health experts, and education leaders need to consider what was learned during Covid-19 and make changes that reflect realities that exist on the ground today. These include: In school settings, testing, contact tracing, masks, and isolation cannot be counted on to control the spread of an avian flu that has adapted to efficiently infect humans. Before Covid-19, these nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were a cornerstone of pandemic response strategy. While such interventions can work for short periods of time in small settings, lack of consistent use and variability in operation make them unreliable over longer periods. It is also clear that views towards masks and other NPIs are influenced by political preferences, which further contribute to differing patterns of behavior and personal use. Beyond political beliefs, however, reports have shown that parents routinely sent their children to school and daycare during Covid-19 because they had no other options for childcare. Students, as well as their parents and other family members, used masks infrequently, incorrectly, or not at all. Some chose not to test themselves for Covid-19 at home, while others tested too often. These decisions and their underlying motivations may be difficult for public health professionals to fully understand, but they must meet students, educators, and parents where they are. Instead of relying on nonpharmaceutical interventions, they should anticipate similar behavior patterns in the event of an avian flu pandemic and plan for it. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the lack of clear authority on decision-making related to school health policies led to inconsistent responses. Not much has changed since then. Many argued during the Covid-19 pandemic that if children's needs had been prioritized by reopening schools ahead of reopening adult social settings, education losses could have been mitigated while also minimizing the impact of the social and emotional aspects of Covid-19-related isolation. Perhaps, but that's not a debate that can be settled at this point. Who takes responsibility for public health measures in the United States today emerges from a widely fragmented patchwork of incomplete administrative policies and political authorities that compete with fundamental ideals of free speech, individualism, and personal liberty. This reality, compounded by the fog of uncertainty in the early days of any viral outbreak, when nearly everything about an emerging infectious disease is up in the air, suggests a high likelihood of repeating the disjointed approach to Covid-19, with some jurisdictions opting to close schools to in-person instruction, others moving to hybrid learning, and others making no changes and remaining open. Coordination processes between local school and public health leaders remain highly variable across the country. If an H5N1 pandemic does emerge, there will be calls for social distancing and school closures to protect students and teachers, just as was seen in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. The challenges may even be the same: It will take time before it is known how efficiently the virus is spreading, what the case and case fatality rates are, and whether and how long schools should remain closed. But this time it will be happening among a public more skeptical of school closures and rightfully expecting far better coordination between health and education officials. Related: Massive amounts of H5N1 vaccine would be needed if there's a bird flu pandemic. Can we make enough? While some districts instituted public health department and school data-sharing practices during the Covid-19 pandemic, these structures have not been institutionalized or scaled reproducibly across the country. Systems like these, which help public health officials understand how disease is spreading within schools and the community, are critical for understanding disease transmission patterns and whether tools like closing schools are necessary. This period right now, between health security events, offers school leaders a chance to pressure test health data sharing systems and online education platforms; perform scenario exercises that test attendance, supply chain, and meal service delivery modeling; and practice online instruction, all of which are critical to improve upon the failures from the collective experience of Covid-19. Preparing schools for the next pandemic In light of this growing potential for a global pandemic from a virus with a high mortality rate, and in the face of unreliable nonpharmaceutical interventions and ineffective local public health infrastructure, what should be done to protect children and schools? Vaccination is one answer, but given the significant disagreement in society about this measure, vaccine mandates are not a realistic option. In its place, getting schools ready for a pandemic will require steps from both the education community and federal health leaders. Step 1 involves urgently and intentionally addressing the gaps between theoretical and practical emergency pandemic response planning that exists in schools. This includes approaching these policies with greater nuance and deeper understanding. School disaster-response plans frequently address other natural and manmade emergencies with greater specificity, but leave infectious disease outbreaks with vague and nonspecific action steps. District superintendents and school principals should use the interpandemic period to take a comprehensive accounting of what changes were instituted during the response to Covid-19, adapt best practices to local contexts, and codify these policies to respond to the challenges laid out above. Step 2 in preparing schools for a pandemic requires action by both the education community and federal health leaders to: Test health data-sharing systems and policies. School districts should establish and test robust, real-time absenteeism data-sharing practices with local health authorities. This should include the pre-approval of memoranda of understanding that can facilitate this data sharing while also protecting personal health information. Conduct tabletop exercises. As with leaders responsible for other critical infrastructure, education leaders should conduct tabletop scenario exercises with local public health leaders to simulate various disease outbreak, vaccination, and treatment scenarios, test critical supply chains, evaluate online education delivery, and improve overall response strategies. Strengthen communication plans. Effective communication between the scientific and education communities was a critical failure during the Covid-19 pandemic. School leaders should develop clear communication plans to keep parents, students, staff, and local governmental leaders, including public health officials, informed about health measures and changes in school operations. These plans should be communicated regularly at school assemblies, parent-teacher conferences, and included with report cards and other mailings to facilitate stakeholder engagement. Step 3 is out of the hands of those in the education community, but is essential: Federal health officials need to accelerate development of both cell-based and mRNA vaccines for pediatric populations as well as for adults. The federal government has made the decision to fill and finish 4.8 million doses of a cell-based vaccine to combat avian influenza, and just announced funding for a Phase 3 trial and acquisition vehicle of an mRNA based vaccine. However, it is unclear whether these trials and purchases include doses for children and adolescents that can be safety tested and made available as quickly as possible. In the event of an H5N1 bird flu pandemic, recreating the Covid-19 experience, in which adult vaccines were approved six months ahead of the pediatric doses, is a recipe for disaster. If the worst comes to pass and this virus makes an efficient jump to humans, vaccines for both adults and children will need to be ready on day one. These are not easy actions to focus on when school budgets are shrinking and leaders are still focused on education recovery after Covid-19. But by taking these steps during this critical interpandemic period, schools will be better prepared for future health security emergencies which will mitigate disruptions to education and ensure a more resilient response.

{"id": "733", "fulltext": "For nearly four months, the spread of bird flu in the nation's dairy cattle has stoked fears that, if left unchecked, the virus could eventually unleash a pandemic. The of human cases connected to poultry farms in Colorado only underscores that the threat remains real. Genetic sequencing of the virus collected from the sickened poultry workers closely resembles what's circulating in dairy herds, suggesting that cattle somehow introduced the virus into the poultry flock. At one massive poultry facility, workers culled the birds under particularly dangerous circumstances. As health officials describe it, they struggled to properly wear protective equipment over their mouth, nose and eyes as they handled thousands of sick birds in a sweltering barn, with industrial fans blowing feathers and other potentially virus-laden material into the air. Given these conditions, it's far from surprising that people would catch the virus themselves, says an epidemiologist at Brown University. \"It's gambling with people's lives,\" she says. \"There's no other way to describe it.\" State and federal health officials are still investigating the scope of the outbreak, although so far all of those who've tested positive have only had mild, flu-like symptoms. Nuzzo says the spillover at the poultry farms drives home the risks of having a viral reservoir in dairy herds that offers the virus ample opportunities to jump between species and potentially adapt to mammals. \"Every time you give an avian virus a chance to infect a human, it's like buying a ticket for a lottery you don't want to win,\" says a virologist at Penn State University transmission of bird flu. Based on the newest research, here's what scientists are learning—and concerned about—as they study the virus. Certain mutations could make the virus more dangerous Luckily, there's no indication that we have drawn the dreaded \"winning ticket.\" At least not yet. The virus working its way through dairy cattle is still fundamentally well-suited to infect birds, not people; however, there are clearly some mutations helping it maintain a foothold in mammals, says a virologist at the Pirbright Institute in the U.K. who studies avian influenza. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it's quite a lot more infectious at the same doses, than a purely avian virus that would have been seen last year in poultry,\" says Peacock, adding that this may give it a leg up when it comes to infecting humans, too. Scientists are still trying to get a better sense of what exactly these changes in the dairy cattle version of H5N1 are doing, but he says there are certainly some mutations that are already enhancing its ability to replicate in mammalian cells. Of most concern would be the virus evolving to get better at using the type of receptors found in the upper respiratory tract of humans. Such a change could let bird flu spread easily via the airborne route between people similar to the seasonal influenza viruses that typically infect humans. Peacock and other scientists are closely watching for changes in proteins on the surface of the virus which would be ground zero for this development. New study suggest virus may be better at infecting mammals than other types of bird flu There are still many outstanding questions about how exactly humans are catching the virus. One possibility, raised by federal health officials, is that a splash of milk, say, in the eyes or elsewhere could explain some of the infections in dairy workers, particularly those whose only symptoms were conjunctivitis. There's also speculation that aerosolized milk could be another source of infection. While the virus still doesn't do well in the upper respiratory tract of humans, Peacock says, evidently there's a degree of replication because nasal swabs are testing positive for low amounts of viral genetic material, at least in some of the human infections. Research on avian influenza predating the dairy cattle outbreak has shown that, with only a, airborne transmission can take place between ferrets, which are used as a model of human infection. Since the dairy cattle outbreak began, scientists have begun to analyze how this version of the virus spreads, in hopes of understanding the threat it poses to humans. The latest research, which comes from a team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shows the virus can be transmitted by respiratory droplets in ferrets, but inefficiently. an author of the study, says their lab has not seen this kind of transmission event with any other version of highly pathogenic avian influenza that they've isolated from the natural world and tested in ferrets. \"There are features present in this virus that are concerning,\" says Eisfeld, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"It's important to be monitoring what is happening here, and to limit infections in cows and exposure in humans.\" In the experiment, only one of the four exposed ferrets caught bird flu from respiratory droplets. That animal didn't have any virus in the nasal swabs, but there were antibodies in the blood showing it had been exposed. Sutton notes that just because a ferret in the lab caught the virus in this way doesn't necessarily mean humans will. In another troubling finding from the team discovered that the virus can bind to the type of receptors found in the upper respiratory tract of humans, suggesting it does possess \"features that may facilitate infection and transmission in mammals,\" the authors write. To figure this out, Eisfeld says they artificially generated these receptors and attached them to a piece of plastic and then added the virus to see if it would stick. Because this wasn't done in actual people, she says the results need to be interpreted with caution: \"I wouldn't want to sound the alarm bells and [suggest] this is transmissible between humans.\" Peacock, who was not involved in the work, says the results do suggest this virus is \"more infectious\" in mammals than previous avian viruses. And while it doesn't appear to be spreading between humans yet, he worries that could change. \"It's an influenza virus, if there's pressure for it to do something, it will learn to do it.\" While this kind of finding is unnerving, Troy Sutton says it needs to be put in context -- lab experiments are essentially creating a \"pro-infection environment\" that may not reflect what happens outside of the lab. \"This isn't exactly what a human nose is like out in the real world,\" he says. \"There's snot and bacteria and there's all these other things that get in the way.\" The virus may be able to spread among cattle through respiratory transmission It's well-established that infected cattle are shedding high levels of virus in the milk for days or even weeks, before eventually recovering. This has supported the hypothesis that the virus is primarily spreading from cow-to-cow during the milking process and through other shared equipment in the dairy barns rather than via the respiratory route. However, some research hints that respiratory transmission can't be ruled out. In one recent study, a small number of non-lactating cows were purposefully infected with aerosols containing bird flu, which was collected from cow milk. Only one of the four animals consistently had viral genetic material in nasal swabs, whereas the rest only had positive results some days. Autopsies showed evidence of viral replication in their lungs, although none of the cattle had serious symptoms. In contrast, the lactating cattle that were deliberately infected on their teats quickly showed signs of disease and increasing viral loads. Taken together, those findings bolster the hypothesis that contact with infected milk is a key source of infection, but they also suggest the respiratory route may still have a role to play, says the lead author of the pre-print study and a research veterinary medical officer at the National Animal Disease Center in Ames, Iowa. \"This doesn't really tell us whether or not this is a main way that it's transmitting in these dairy farms, but it points to the fact that we need to at least keep an open mind that respiratory infection and transmission could occur,\" she says. The risks of a hands-off approach to stopping the outbreak To be clear: There's no evidence yet that humans who've caught the virus have spread it to others, which is why the CDC still deems the risk to the general public low. What's more, at two farms with outbreaks analyzed blood samples and found no antibodies suggesting past infections that went undetected. The human infections that have cropped up all seem to have occurred in \"heavily virus contaminated, high virus dose environments,\" which is reassuring because it means that steps can be taken to minimize the spread, says Sutton. \"If you started to see people getting infected, with low-virus doses, that would be alarming,\" he says. Federal health officials maintain it's still possible to quash the outbreak in dairy cattle. Nuzzo is skeptical. She's yet to see a clearly articulated, viable strategy for ending the spread. New cases are in dairy herds every week. As a scientist tracking the situation from outside the U.S., Peacock struggles to make sense of how the government hasn't curtailed the spread of a virus that has true pandemic potential, even after months of mobilizing a response. \"My feeling is that if there were even just moderate efforts to stop this, it would have been stopped already,\" he says.

{"id": "738", "fulltext": "New York State's stockpile of antiviral medications for flu contains only one drug, Tamiflu, leaving no fallback plan. New York's plan for confronting bird flu if it begins spreading among people relies heavily on a vast stockpile of flu treatment medicine. But experts worry the stockpile is missing a key tool. New York has only one type of flu antiviral drug, Tamiflu, which might prove less effective than hoped against a pandemic strain of bird flu, some experts say. There is another antiviral that might work, even if Tamiflu doesn't—a drug called baloxavir marboxil. And yet the state has not stored a single dose of it in case of emergency. \"There could be an Achilles' heel here,\" said Dr. Sean T. Liu, an infectious disease expert at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Given the uncertainty about how bird flu might evolve and what treatments might ultimately work best, some public health experts worry that New York might have too much riding on a single drug, when an alternative is available. \"It is always wise, when there are unknown variables, to have more than one therapeutic option in your toolbox,\" said Dr. Howard Zucker, the former state health commissioner, who led the Health Department during the coronavirus pandemic and oversaw the state's epidemic stockpile until 2021. The next pandemic, some experts worry, could land soon in the form of H5N1, a flu virus that has long circulated in wild birds, occasionally causing outbreaks at poultry farms. The virus can infect people who come into contact with diseased birds and has killed about half of the 1,000 or so people known to have contracted it. It has shown little ability to spread from one person to another, but it has begun jumping to mammals, a worrisome development. Late last year it began spreading among dairy cattle, infecting herds from Texas to Michigan. Public health officials have long prepared for the possibility that it might one day be able to transmit efficiently from human to human. In New York, state health authorities have stockpiled ventilators and amassed enough Tamiflu for about 10 percent of the state's population. The federal government and New York City also have their own stockpiles. The state bought the Tamiflu more than 15 years ago, when it was the obvious choice as the leading flu antiviral. But in 2018, a promising new flu drug entered the market: baloxavir marboxil, which is marketed as Xofluza. There is no way of knowing how effective either drug would be against a pandemic flu strain that has not yet evolved. Tamiflu could work well, but it might not. The same goes for baloxavir. Some versions of H5N1 circulating have mutations that make them resistant to Tamiflu, and baloxavir works differently. When the flu virus infects a cell, it hijacks the cell's machinery to churn out new virus particles. Tamiflu targets the viral enzyme that allows newly formed virus particles to break loose from the infected cell. That limits their ability to infect new cells. Baloxavir blocks a different enzyme and prevents viral replication within the host cell. During a flu pandemic, antiviral medications could mean the difference between life and death for those infected—especially in the first wave before a vaccine is available. A Health Department spokeswoman, Erin Clary, noted that baloxavir is expensive, often $180 at a pharmacy. It is unclear whether other states have purchased it in bulk as part of their pandemic response plans. \"Stockpiling a costly drug that is not recommended by the C.D.C. is financially irresponsible,\" she said, adding that oseltamivir—the generic form of Tamiflu—is the \"primary recommended antiviral\" for bird flu. The C.D.C. recommendations that Ms. Clary cited, however, are guidance for doctors regarding what drugs and dosages to use, not instructions for how public health authorities should prepare for the unknown. Dr. Liu of Mount Sinai, who treated Covid-19 patients and previously worked on developing a universal flu vaccine, noted that some viruses are best treated with a cocktail of drugs, rather than with just one. In interviews, several doctors said that in a flu pandemic, they might want the option of treating patients with both Tamiflu and baloxavir at once. \"If it were me and I got H5N1 right now and I was terribly sick, I would definitely ask for a combination of two things,\" Dr. Liu said. Baloxavir is not in New York's stockpile of antiviral medications for a variety of reasons. In the mid-2000s, as the federal government built up its own stockpile of Tamiflu, it offered to subsidize states' efforts to do the same. New York bought 2,029,721 courses of Tamiflu manufactured in 2006 and 2007. Baloxavir was not approved for use until 2018. At that time, a committee of federal scientists recommended ordering eight million courses of baloxavir for the federal stockpile, said Dr. Rick Bright, who at the time headed the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a federal agency involved in disaster preparations. There was a pressing need to \"diversify\" the medications in the stockpile, Dr. Bright recalled. But higher-ups ignored this recommendation and opted for more Tamiflu, he said. The patent for Tamiflu had expired in 2016 and the generic form of the drug—oseltamivir—became available and was relatively cheap. Dr. Bright filed a whistle-blower complaint in 2020, in part over the Trump administration's Covid-19 response, but also criticizing federal officials for their decision to forgo baloxavir. The complaint claims that \"political connections and cronyism\" played a role in pharmaceutical contracts for the federal stockpile. The contract for the generic form of Tamiflu was awarded to a pharmaceutical company that was represented by a favored consultant who seemed to have an \"outsized role\" in contracting decisions, according to the whistle-blower complaint. At the time, the consultant issued a statement in which he \"unequivocally\" denied wrongdoing and said Dr. Bright's allegations were false. A spokesman for the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which oversees the stockpile, declined to comment on the specifics of Dr. Bright's complaint, noting that his concerns related to the prior presidential administration. The spokesman, Spencer Pretecrum, said his agency had sought to \"build a diverse inventory of medical countermeasures in the Strategic National Stockpile that most efficiently and broadly protect against a range of potential pathogens.\" The federal government has since added between 500,000 and one million courses of baloxavir to its stockpile, according to Mr. Pretecrum, the agency spokesman. He said future orders were anticipated. But in New York, the Health Department has shown little interest in adding baloxavir to its stockpile. \"The department is not considering stockpiling baloxavir at this time,\" Ms. Clary, the spokeswoman, said. Jay Varma, a former C.D.C. epidemiologist who helped guide New York City's response to Covid-19 as a City Hall adviser, urged city and state health officials to conduct their own assessments. \"I do think it's important for New York State and New York City to be carefully assessing the potential needs for antivirals in the event that H5N1 evolves into sustained human-to-human transmission,\" he said. The city's stockpile is smaller, with 427,000 courses of Tamiflu, and no baloxavir. Regardless of how bird flu develops, New York State may soon be forced to replenish its stockpile. After the F.D.A. previously extended the shelf life of the state's doses of Tamiflu, they are set to expire in 2026 and 2027.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_5", "statement": "I do think it's important for New York State and New York City to be carefully assessing the potential needs for antivirals in the event that H5N1 evolves into sustained human-to-human transmission."}]}
{"id": "743", "fulltext": "(CNN) — The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday a new $5 million initiative to offer seasonal flu vaccines to livestock workers in order to reduce the public health concern that a new version of the influenza virus could emerge among farm workers who are at a higher risk of getting infected with the bird flu (H5N1) virus that has been in circulation in millions of farmed and wild animals. The goal of the initiative is to protect the health and safety of livestock workers as seasonal respiratory viruses begin to circulate, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC said Tuesday. \"Preventing seasonal influenza in these workers, many of whom are also potentially exposed to H5N1 viruses may also reduce the risk of new versions of the influenza A virus emerging,\" Shah said at the news conference. If two different strains of the flu infect a person there is always a risk that the viruses could mix together and create a completely new virus with a mix of traits from each one. A new virus could emerge that could be harmless, but there is also a chance that a new virus could be even more contagious, deadly or resistant to existing treatments. The risk of what is called genetic reassortment — when multiple viruses co-infect the same cell and replicate to create a new virus — is \"theoretical,\" Shah said, but \"because we know that it could happen, we want to take steps now to reduce that effect.\" \"Anything that is predictable is also something that's preventable,\" Shah said. Reassortment has happened with other influenza viruses. In 2009 H1N1, what Shah described as \"a close cousin\" of H5N1, was thought to have emerged because of genetic reassortment of influenza A viruses in pigs. \"I'm not suggesting that it was a human-pig interaction that led to that reassortment, but it was thought to be a reassortment-type event between a novel H1 virus and a more seasonal variety,\" Shah said. \"This is something that has occurred and it's a concern for that reason. Anything we can do to reduce the likelihood that a new virus that emerges that has the transmissibility of seasonal flu with the severity of H5 is a risk that we want to reduce as much as possible.\" The CDC said with this new initiative, the seasonal flu vaccine will not be mandatory for farm workers. Public health officials on a state-level will bring vaccines to workers at local events and to areas where farm workers typically gather. \"This is fundamentally an effort that relies upon trust and that trust relies upon us making the case for why the vaccine is important,\" Shah said. The seasonal flu vaccine does not provide protection against bird flu. The CDC said it still does not think a specific bird flu vaccine is necessary even among workers that are at a higher risk who work with infected animals. While there have been additional cases in humans with the outbreak, Shah said, symptoms have been mild and the prevalence is still \"extremely low\" and does not warrant a H5 specific vaccination. The CDC announced an additional $4 million will be sent to the National Center for Farmworker Health to help prevent more workers from getting sick with bird flu. The federal organization will use the money to partner with community-based organizations in impacted states. Together the organizations will provide training and information sessions about bird flu and the organizations will expand access to testing, treatment and PPE. The CDC said Tuesday that there are nine known human cases of H5N1 among poultry workers in Colorado related to the latest outbreak. Earlier the CDC said that the workers who got sick had been culling poultry believed to be infected at a farm in the northeast part of the state. The latest human cases are mild. Most people who are sick have pink eye. The CDC said there are no additional tests pending, but there still could be additional cases. There have been a handful of cases in other states including in Texas and in Michigan. All were farm workers. The general public's risk of getting sick with bird flu still remains low, according to the CDC. The is still a real risk for animals. The outbreak has impacted millions of animals with outbreaks in commercial poultry and in back yard flocks, cows, wild birds, wild mammals and some cases among pets, mostly among cats.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_1", "statement": "The goal of the initiative is to protect the health and safety of livestock workers as seasonal respiratory viruses begin to circulate, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC said Tuesday.

{"id": "745", "fulltext": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday that it is funding a $5 million program to vaccinate livestock industry workers against seasonal flu in a bid to reduce the pandemic risk posed by the ongoing H5N1 bird flu outbreak in cattle. The voluntary program, which will be administered by state and local public health workers, is aimed at getting seasonal flu shots into as many people as possible who are working in proximity to animals—poultry, cows, or other livestock—that could be infected with H5N1. Nirav Shah, the CDC's principal deputy director, said there are an estimated 200,000 people officially working in this sector nationwide, though he acknowledged that number doesn’t encompass all people working with these animals. H5N1 could evolve to become a pandemic flu strain one of two ways, by gradually acquiring mutations that give it the ability to easily infect and spread among people, or by swapping genetic material with other flu viruses, such as H3N2 or H1N1, the influenza A viruses that circulate and cause illness during the flu season. That gene swapping, a process called reassortment, can occur when an animal or a person is infected at the same time with two or more flu A viruses. The rationale for the CDC program is to lower the risk that farmworkers will be infected with human flu strains during the coming flu season and, if they go to work sick, transmit human flu viruses to cows or other mammals already infected with H5N1, or themselves become co-infected with the bird flu virus.

A virus that has the transmissibility of seasonal influenza and the severity of H5N1,” Shah, the CDC’s principal deputy director, said during a press conference featuring the CDC and officials of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “We want to do everything we can to reduce the risk that the virus may change because of co-infection and reassortment.” For the time being, though, “everything” stops short of offering these same workers H5N1 vaccine from the U.S. National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile. Finland is vaccinating mink farm workers against H5N1, which has caused outbreaks in these animals. But the U.S. government has said at this point it doesn’t see a value in following suit. “Given the low rates of [human H5N1] infection overall, the mild symptoms, the lack of person-to-person [transmission], I don’t think the question is: Why not do it? I think the question is: Why do it?” Shah said. Related: Could cow vaccines help halt the spread of bird flu in U.S. herds? Experts are divided Shah said there are ongoing discussions among U.S. officials about whether to offer H5N1 vaccine to farmworkers, but “for right now, the seasonal flu shot is the right tool for the job.” The CDC will spend up to $2 million on the flu shots, with the remaining $3 million going to finance on-the-ground efforts to get the vaccine to farmworkers, Shah said. Implementation will look different from location to location, he noted, and may involve bringing vaccine doses to farms, or setting up vaccination booths at public events that are frequented by farmworkers. Since the outbreak of bird flu in cows was first recognized in late March, 13 workers have been diagnosed with H5N1. All the cases to date have been mild. Four of the cases were farmworkers infected while working with dairy cattle; the other nine were people who were infected while culling chickens when the virus from cows spilled over into two large poultry operations in Colorado. Related: USDA maintains bird flu can be eliminated from dairy cows, even as doubts mount among experts Since the outbreak was first recognized, the USDA has confirmed infections in 172 herds in 13 states. Eric Deeble, USDA’s point person for H5N1 in dairy cows, said the department continues to believe the outbreak can be contained. “Given that we have seen a real increase in awareness of producers and an increase in biosecurity, we believe that we can arrest the spread of this disease and ultimately eradicate it in dairy cattle on the farms,” he said. Another USDA official, Michael Pruitt, indicated that the department has been studying viruses from the outbreak on an ongoing basis and is not seeing evidence that the virus has been evolving in cows, calling it “very stable up to this point.”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_statement_3", "statement": "In theory, reassortment could lead to a new influenza virus that could pose a significant public health concern.
