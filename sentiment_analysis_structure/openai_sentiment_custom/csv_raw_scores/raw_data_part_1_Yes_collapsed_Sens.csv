"Avian Influenza in China Adds to Economic Concerns Amid Coronavirus Spread; China pledges more support for its economy, exempts from punitive tariffs products",1580515200000,"HONG KONG�hinese authorities announced Saturday a recurrence of avian influenza in chickens in central China, adding fresh economic concerns for a country reeling from an outbreak of coronavirus that has sickened nearly 12,000 people since it emerged in December.

In a sign of the pressure already on China, Australia and Vietnam joined the U.S. and others in distancing their citizens from the country over the coronavirus, while Apple Inc. shut its stores on the Chinese mainland and Beijing pledged more support for embattled businesses.

The Latest on the Coronavirus

* Australia orders its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days

* Vietnam halts all flights to and from Taiwan and China

* Apple closes all of its retail stores in mainland China until Feb. 9

* Beijing pledges more support for its economy

* Avian influenza adds to concerns about economy

The avian influenza is likely to add to the economic damage rather than pose a major immediate health risk. China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that a case of H5N1 avian influenza, last identified in China in April last year , had killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. But while avian influenza can be fatal in humans, with a mortality rate of 60%, according to the World Health Organization, it doesn't spread easily to humans.

In addition to the coronavirus, China has been grappling with an outbreak of African swine fever that has decimated the country's pig population over the past two years. Pork is China's main source of protein, and swine fever last year pushed overall consumer inflation to the highest level in eight years.

Hunan province, where the avian influenza outbreak announced on Saturday took place, neighbors Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.

Australia said that it would impose new entry restrictions in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, banning foreign nationals who have been in mainland China in the past 14 days from entering Australia, while Qantas Airways Ltd., the country's national carrier, said it would suspend flights to the mainland  starting Feb. 9.

Vietnam's civil aviation authority said it would halt all flights to and from Taiwan and China, including the special Chinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong, starting Saturday.

Several countries and airlines have suspended flights to China, including Pakistan, Italy and the U.S.'s American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc.

The move by Australia, which also ordered its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days, to tighten entry restrictions followed a U.S. tightening. A day earlier, the U.S. said it would deny entry to foreign nationals who had traveled anywhere in China within the past 14 days and imposed quarantines on Americans returning from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan.

The coronavirus has killed 259 people and infected nearly 12,000 in China as of late Friday, according to the official National Health Commission in Beijing. The number of infected patients in China alone now exceeds the global total for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed nearly 800 people after emerging from southern China in 2002 and 2003.

Authorities in Beijing pledged more support for the economy  in a bid to reassure investors before markets reopen on Monday  .

Companies and industries in regions hit particularly hard by the outbreak, including those that provide medical supplies, could get reduced lending rates, the central bank said in a joint statement with other government agencies, including the Finance Ministry and the banking regulator.

China's cabinet said separately that products imported from the U.S. to control the outbreak will be exempt from punitive tariffs through March 31. Authorities also exempted tariffs and other taxes on products donated by overseas entities, according to a joint statement by the Finance Ministry and the customs agency.

Resources are strained  in Hubei province, and medical staff have been forced to turn away patients because of a lack of beds and basic medical supplies.

Local authorities in Huanggang, a city about 35 miles east of Wuhan, imposed new restrictions on residents' movements, saying only one person per household in the city center would be allowed to go out every two days to purchase basic necessities.

Apple is closing all of its retail stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb. 9 ""out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts,"" it said. The company operates more than 40 stores in China.

North Korea said through its state media that it would send an aid fund to Chinese authorities, a rare extension of aid from Pyongyang.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, ""expressed deep consolation for the families who lost their blood relatives due to the infectious disease,"" according to a report in Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency.

North Korea� close ally of China that has long been dependent on China's largess�as among the first countries to adopt stringent measures to keep the coronavirus outside its borders, and vowed to redouble its efforts.

""The novel coronavirus throws the world into uneasiness and horror, but the advantages and might of our state system�ill be fully demonstrated to the whole world once again, when we ensure that the virus does not reach our country and that no one suffers from the infections,"" it read.

Avian Flu Fast Facts,1717545600000,"(CNN) � Here's a look at avian flu.
Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds.
There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and
H10 have caused deaths in humans.
The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called ""Influenza A (H5N1),"" or the ""H5N1 virus.""
Diagnosis/Treatment
Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated
with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces.
Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and
pneumonia.
The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and
intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu.
The mortality rate is close to 60% for infected humans.

Egypt reports bird flu outbreaks in rural area,1608508800000,"CAIRO (AP) �ocal authorities in rural Egypt have declared a state of emergency after detecting two outbreaks of bird flu. Nagy Awad, head of the veterinary agency in the southwestern province of al-Wadi al-Gedid, said Sunday that avian influenza was detected in two poultry farms in the villages of Ezab el-Qasr and Oweina in the Dakhla Oasis, located over 750 kilometers (470 miles) from the capital, Cairo. He said the infected birds were culled and authorities have carried out medical examinations of people who were in contact with them. The virus, which is mainly spread through contact with infected animals, can cause severe illness or death in humans. Egypt suffered a major outbreak of bird flu in 2006 that led to the suspension of all poultry exports. Authorities have been pressing to renew them, and earlier this year, the World Organization for Animal Health, an intergovernmental body, had declared Egypt free of bird flu for the first time in 14 years. The H5N1 strain of bird flu spread in early 2000s in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, leading to the slaughter of tens of millions of chickens and ducks. Hundreds of people were infected, many of whom died, according to the World Health Organization. Egypt is at high risk because many of its poultry farms are in residential areas. Many Egyptians also raise pigeons and chickens at home to supplement their income. Even in dense urban areas, birds are kept on rooftops, balconies and courtyards. FILE - In this Feb. 24, 2007 file photo, poultry traders feed some of their birds in the village of Tanta in the Nile deltas, 150 kilometers (93 miles) north of the capital Cairo, Egypt.

"A New  Bird Flu  Jumps to Humans. So Far, It� Not a Problem.",1618963200000,"Covid fuels the current virus pandemic, but the world is full of flu viruses waiting in the wings. And they keep changing unpredictably. When a bird flu virus struck a major poultry farm in Russia earlier this year, it was a reminder that the coronavirus causing the pandemic was not the only dangerous virus out there. The authorities quickly tested the birds and moved into high gear, killing 800,000 chickens, disposing of the carcasses and cleaning the farm to stop the potential spread to other chicken farms. But they were also concerned for humans. They tested the birds and sequenced the virus, determining that it was the H5N8 strain of avian flu, highly dangerous to both wild and domestic birds. It is established in Asia and has been increasingly causing deadly outbreaks in birds in Europe. H5N8 viruses have infected some poultry flocks in the United States, but the viruses come from a different though related lineage of virus, distinct from the current H5N8 viruses in Asia and Europe. Flu viruses combine and mutate frequently in unpredictable ways. In the short period from Dec. 25, 2020, to Jan. 14 of this year, more than seven million birds were lost to H5N8 outbreaks in Europe and Asia. Europe alone had 135 outbreaks among poultry and 35 among wild birds. Of course, to put the numbers in context, humans consume about 65 billion chickens each year, and one estimate puts the number of chickens on the globe at any one time at 23 billion. As damaging as H5N8 has been to birds, it had never infected people. Until February. The Russian health authorities also tested about 200 of the people involved in the cleanup of the farm in Astrakhan, using nasal swabs and later blood tests for antibodies. They reported that for the first time, H5N8 had jumped to people. Seven of the workers appeared to have been infected with the virus, although none of them became ill. Only one of those seven cases, however, was confirmed by genetically sequencing the virus. Nonetheless, the potential danger of the new virus and its jump to humans set off alarm bells for Dr. Daniel R. Lucey, a physician and a specialist in pandemics at Georgetown University. He began writing about the Astrakhan event in a blog for other infectious disease experts as soon as it was publicized. He reported that during a television interview, a Russian public health official said the H5N8 virus was likely to evolve into human-to-human transmission. That possibility was frightening. �The W.H.O. finally put out a report Feb. 26,�e said. But it did not frame the event as particularly alarming because the virus was not causing human disease, and the report judged the risk of human-to-human transmission as low, despite the Russian official� comment. To Dr. Lucey, no one else seemed to be taking the infection of humans with H5N8 as �f any concern.�e added, � think it� of concern.� Other scientists said they were not as worried. Dr. Florian Krammer, a flu researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, said he was more concerned about other avian flu viruses like H5N1 that have already shown themselves to be dangerous to people. Another avian influenza virus, H7N9, infected people for the first time in 2013. There have been more than 1,500 confirmed cases and more than 600 deaths since then. Since 2017 there have been only three confirmed cases and the virus does not jump easily from person to person. It is always possible that any virus can evolve human-to-human transmission, as well as become more dangerous. But H5N8 would have both hurdles to jump. Compared to other viral threats, Dr. Krammer said, �� not worried.� Dr. Richard J. Webby, a flu specialist at the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and director of the W.H.O.� Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that all of the H5 viruses are of concern because some of them have infected and killed people. But, he said, �hey all have the same sort of binding capacity to human cells, which is limited,�e said. Flu viruses use a slightly different way to attach to cells in birds than to cells in humans and being good at one usually means not being good at the other. Dr. Webby also said that while seven infections would certainly be of concern, only one infection has been confirmed. The tests of the other six involved nasal swabs and blood antibody tests. In people with no symptoms, he said, nasal swabs can simply indicate that they had breathed in virus. That would not mean it had infected them. Blood antibody tests also have a potential for error, he said, and may not be able to distinguish exposure to one flu virus from another. Nor did he see any scientific basis for suggesting that H5N8 is more likely than any other bird flu to evolve human-to-human transmission. But any virus could evolve that ability. Dr. Lucey said that he was heartened to see that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had prepared a candidate vaccine for H5N8 before it had infected humans. Candidate vaccines are simply first steps in planning for potential problems, and have not been through any testing. They exist for many viruses. �umans should be routinely tested for the virus, right at the time of the outbreak in birds,�r. Lucey said.

A man in China may be the world's first human to be infected with H10N3 strain of bird flu. What we know.,1622505600000,"A man in eastern China may be the first confirmed human case of infection with the H10N3 strain of bird flu, China� National Health Commission (NHC) said Tuesday.

The 41-year-old man from Jiangsu province, located northwest of Shanghai, was hospitalized April 28 after developing fever and other symptoms.

He was diagnosed with the infection on May 28, according to Reuters, but is now stable and ready to be discharged from the hospital.

The health commission said the infection was a result of accidental cross-species transmission. The risk of widespread transmission is low, Chinese officials said, and there are no other human cases of H10N3 reported elsewhere in the world.

Avian influenza Type A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds and have been found in more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While these viruses don� normally infect humans, birds can shed virus in their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC says. Human infections can occur if enough virus gets into a person� eyes, nose, or mouth.

The CDC says two strains of bird flu viruses have been mostly responsible for human infection and mortality: H7N9 and H5N1. Symptoms of avian influenza A virus infections can range from mild to severe and include conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness such as fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches.

Symptoms can also be accompanied by nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and severe respiratory illness, according to the CDC.

While it� possible for some of these viruses to jump from birds to humans, they so far don� have the capability of transmitting between humans, said J�gen Richt, a professor at Kansas State University and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases with the National Institutes of Health.

�his is our biggest fear,�aid Richt, who also directs the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases for the Department of Homeland Security. �f they were to transmit human to human, then we would be at a worse situation than COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates.�

This is because bird flu strains can be particularly deadly among human populations. According to the World Health Organization, the case-fatality rate of H7N9 is roughly 30%; H5N1 is 60%.

It may be unlikely the H10N3 strain can transmit between humans, Richt said, but scientists can� know for sure until they learn its genetic code and conduct epidemiological surveillance to determine if any other contacts were infected.

�he reason for that is that avian influenza viruses spread among avian species using different receptors than mammalian influenza viruses,�e said. �n order for these viruses to transmit (among humans), the virus needs to adapt. There� several adaptation steps and, so far, this has not happened with avian flu viruses.�

What Is Going on With Bird Flu? China Reports First Human Case of H10N3 Strain,1622764800000,"Chinese health authorities said a 41-year-old man had contracted a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3 and had been in the hospital since late April, calling it the first reported human case globally from the strain. The National Health Commission said the man developed a fever and other symptoms on April 23 and was admitted to hospital in Jiangsu province five days later. On Tuesday the health commission said his condition was stable and indicated he was ready to be discharged.

How did the man become infected?

The health commission didn't give details on how the man came into contact with the virus. Cases of bird flu in humans have most commonly been reported among those in close daily contact with poultry, such as chicken farmers. The commission advised the public to avoid contact with sick and dead poultry.

Can bird flu kill people?

Avian influenza can be fatal in humans. Highly pathogenic strains, such as H5N1, can have a mortality rate of about 60%, according to the World Health Organization. However, the WHO says, bird flu doesn't spread easily from birds to people.

How common are bird-flu outbreaks in China?

China has seen several outbreaks of bird flu, including one at the height of the coronavirus outbreak  last year, when H5N1 avian influenza killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds.

In May, China's Agriculture Ministry said the H5N8 strain of bird flu killed hundreds of wild birds in Tibet, prompting authorities to disinfect areas including a national wetland park.

Are authorities worried?

China said the risk of a large-scale outbreak was extremely low. It said local health authorities' contact-tracing and monitoring efforts had found no other cases and no human-to-human transmission. It said the H10N3 strain doesn't have the ability to effectively infect humans.

What do experts say?

Human infections with bird-flu viruses are rare but not uncommon, said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, a professor at the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.

""It is highly likely that this infection just represents one of the rare incidents of human infection with an avian influenza virus, without any more consequences,"" said Prof. Garcia-Sastre. ""Nevertheless, it's important to make sure that this is just that, a rare isolated incident.""

The fact that the case happened in April and there hasn't been any other reports of cases suggests there hasn't been a cluster of infections, says Peng Shifang, a professor of infectious diseases at Central South University in China's Hunan province.

Is China upfront about the recent bird-flu case?

China said it had determined on May 28 through genome sequencing that the man suffered from the H10N3 strain. It issued its statement on the results on Tuesday.

While China has been criticized for a lack of transparency  in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, its public-health apparatus is generally seen as having become more transparent since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, when official secrecy hampered the response.

A human case of bird flu is reported in China.,1626307200000,"State news media said that a 55-year-old man had been hospitalized with the H5N6 virus but that the risk of large-scale transmission was low.

A man has been hospitalized in southwestern China after contracting the H5N6 strain of avian flu, Chinese state news media reported on Thursday, a reminder that the world is full of flu viruses even during a coronavirus pandemic.

The man, 55, was hospitalized in Bazhong, a city in the southwestern province of Sichuan, after coming down with a fever and testing positive for the virus on July 6, the state-run China Global Television Network reported.

Local officials had �ctivated an emergency response and sterilized the area,�he broadcaster said in a brief report in English. It cited unnamed experts as saying that the risk of large-scale transmission among humans was low. The report did not provide other details or say whether the man handled poultry as part of his job.

The H5N6 virus is one of several potentially dangerous flu versions that scientists have reported finding over the years in poultry flocks or in captured or dead wild birds. It was first detected eight years ago in Laos, and later spread to China and other countries.

As of last week, 32 confirmed cases of human infection with the H5N6 virus, and 19 deaths, had been reported to the World Health Organization in Asia since 2014, according to the agency. The last human case before the one from Sichuan Province had an onset date of May 13.

Because flu viruses mutate a lot in nature, scientists try to monitor them closely for signs that they are becoming more contagious or deadly. Last year in China, for example, a team of scientists reported that a new strain of the H1N1 swine flu virus was spreading silently in workers on the country� pig farms and should be �rgently�ontrolled to avoid another pandemic, even though the strain had not caused disease in the people it infected.",NYTimes,yes,no,"The article reports 19 deaths out of 32 confirmed human cases of H5N6, indicating a high mortality rate.

What is bird flu and why is it back in the news?,1639008000000,"With the UK hit by a record outbreak, here� a quick guide to the viral disease also known as avian influenza

What is avian flu?

Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a contagious viral disease in animals, caused by a virus loosely related to human influenza. Some strains of the disease have been passed to humans but this is very rare, and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals. While all bird species and, less commonly, pigs are thought to be susceptible, domestic poultry flocks are especially vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks can rapidly result in epidemics among bird populations. Public health authorities are concerned about the potential of the virus to mutate into subtypes capable of causing human disease. As a result they warn there is always a threat of a new influenza pandemic emerging.

Why is it in the news again?

The UK has been hit by a record outbreak that has resulted in 500,000 captive birds being culled this autumn. An avian influenza prevention zone was declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors.

What are the most dangerous strains?

The NHS says there are four strains that have caused particular concern in recent years. The first, identified in 1997, was H5N1, followed by H7N9 in 2013, H5N6 the following year and H5N8 in 2016. The H5N1 form has been the cause of most concern in recent years and the UK government has said particular safety measures were put in place in parts of North Yorkshire on 21 November after confirmed and suspected cases of that strain in poultry in the area.

Where has it appeared?

The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, has said there are 40 infected premises in the UK. They include 38 in Great Britain �f which 33 are in England �nd two in Northern Ireland. By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter.

A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland� Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on the Trotternish peninsula, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese.

Some 22,100 ducks were culled at a commercial premises in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, while culling and an exclusion zone was also being applied to a second site in Broughshane, Co Antrim, described as a �mall backyard flock�

If it just affects birds, why the panic?

It doesn�. World Health Organization (WHO) figures show that from 2003 to 2021 there were 863 confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus in humans. Of these cases, 456 people died. While transmission is rare, it has happened.

So far, most of the human deaths have been in countries in Asia, in communities in which people live in close proximity to poultry. Although it does not easily infect humans, every time it does it increases the chance that the virus could mutate into a form that could be passed from one infected human to another. The WHO fears this could lead to a flu pandemic.

How do you catch bird flu?

It is very unlikely you will catch the virus unless you have been in close contact with infected birds or someone with confirmed or suspected bird flu. The virus is found in secretions from the eyes and respiratory tract, and droppings of infected birds. Humans can catch the virus by inhaling droplets sneezed by infected birds or the dust from their bedding or droppings.

What are the symptoms in humans?

They vary depending on the strain. Most infections have flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and aches and pains. Symptoms of the H5N1 subtype are more severe and frequently result in death. Other symptoms can include conjunctivitis �ed, sore and discharging eyes.

How does it spread?

WHO scientists have said they believe it is likely the virus is carried by migrating birds. More recently the UK government has said it �preads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces� Officials added: �t can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear �vian influenza isn� an airborne virus.�

It can spread to humans who touch infected birds, droppings or bedding or who kill or prepare infected poultry for cooking, the NHS has said. People cannot catch bird flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas affected by an outbreak, health officials have said.

What measures is the UK taking?

The government has said the chief veterinary officers for each of the UK� constituent nations have �greed to bring in new housing measures to protect poultry and captive birds from avian influenza following a number of confirmed cases across Great Britain in recent weeks� It added: �he new housing measures, which will come into force on Monday 29 November, mean that it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.�

How do you spot the virus in birds?

Symptoms in infected birds include a swollen head and blue discoloration around the neck and throat. They will also show signs of breathing problems including gaping beaks, coughing, sneezing and rattling wheezing. Poultry farmers will also notice a loss of appetite in the infected birds and a decrease in egg laying.

People are advised not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds they find. In Great Britain, dead wild waterfowl or other wild birds should be reported to Defra. Some will then be collected and tested to help scientists understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird.

What drug treatments are available to humans?

There is no vaccine for avian flu. If a person were infected, the NHS has said they would be either told to stay at home or put into isolation in hospital. They would then be treated with an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (known as Tamiflu) or zanamivir (known as Relenza).

Scientists have found that such treatments �elp reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival.

"Bird flu outbreak in Israel kills more than 5,200 cranes, with mass culling of poultry underway",1640649600000,"Israel is battling the coronavirus and a surge in flu cases. But it's an outbreak of the H5N1 avian flu among migratory cranes and domestic poultry that is drawing global concern.

The bird flu, as its also called, is spreading fast in northern Israel, where at least 5,200 cranes have died of the disease and hundreds of thousands of chickens have been culled in an effort to contain its advance.

The avian flu is confined mostly to birds. It rarely jumps to humans, but when it does it can be lethal. As of October, the World Health Organization had confirmed 863 cases of H5N1 in people, 456 of whom died, around the world since 2003.

Israel has not recorded any infections in humans this year. Those who have possibly been exposed to the virus are receiving preventive antiviral treatments.

Other countries, including Britain, China, Norway and South Korea, have also reported major or higher-than-unusual H5N1 outbreaks in recent months. In November, Britain declared a bird flu prevention zone, requiring all farmers to follow stricter biosecurity protocols after several outbreaks.

Israel is a central stop along the route of many species of birds migrating from Europe and Asia to Africa, a convergence that raises the risk of avian flu spreading from wild birds to captive poultry populations in the country.

Each year, about 500,000 cranes migrate through Israel, some 30,000 of which stayed to winter over there this year. The yearly stopover, often part of journeys lasting thousands of miles, draws the attention of bird enthusiasts, who travel to observe the large, long-legged and long-necked birds.

The H5N1 outbreak has wrought ""the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country,"" Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg said in a tweet Sunday.

She shared a photo of dead cranes peppering a lake in Israel's Hula Nature Reserve, a hot spot for migratory birds.

""The extent of the damage is still unclear,"" Zandberg said.

Israel reported its first cases of bird flu in 2006, and has seen outbreaks nearly every year since, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

The extent of this year's train of transmission is not yet clear, but regulations require poultry and wild birds be kept separated to limit the chance of transference.

Word of Israel's latest outbreak began to spread on Dec. 19, when the Agriculture Ministry reported that H5N1 had been detected in a farming community, Margaliot, near Israel's northern border with Lebanon. The ministry said it had closed off the area and halted egg production.

Crowded and unregulated chicken coops are a ""ticking bomb"" for developing diseases, Agriculture Minister Oded Feror said in a statement at the time.

That same day, Israeli media reported that about 100 cranes had died in a bird flu outbreak in Hula Lake in a nature reserve in northern Israel. Authorities closed down the area to the public and days later temporarily shut the entire nature reserve.

Israel's Nature and Parks Authority shared photos of workers in hazmat suits collecting the bodies of dead cranes from the water.

In the following days, outbreaks were detected in at least three other farms in the north as the Agriculture Ministry underwent mass testing.

The parks authority said Thursday that an estimated 1 in 5 cranes in Israel were likely to be infected with the virus, Israeli media reported. There have also been reports of deaths from the virus among other bird species.

Israel's Agricultural Ministry has warned the public to buy only eggs with the required regulatory stamp and to consume thoroughly cooked eggs to prevent any further spread. The public has also been warned to keep a distance from wild birds.

On Tuesday, the ministry told chicken farmers in Margaliot to monitor cats that spend time around the coops, as felines can also become infected with the virus.

Israeli media outlets reported that the mass culling of chickens has created a shortage of between 15 million and 20 million eggs a month. About 200 million eggs are consumed monthly in Israel.",WaPo,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, with 456 deaths out of 863 cases since 2003, but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.",the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country,Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg,0.0,7.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,6,3,7,4,5,3,5,7,2,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,10.2,11.25,0.0502253521,0.096943662,0.0327605634,0.1660422535,0.0821830986,0.3563802817,0.3720704225,0.1073521127,0.0731830986,0.1197605634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5235,0.0,0.5235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.578,0.0,0.391,0.0,0.0,1.545,0.0,0.576,0.0,0.0,,The extent of the damage is still unclear,Tamar Zandberg,ticking bomb,Agriculture Minister Oded Feror,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.578,0.0,0.391,0.0,0.0,1.545,0.0,0.576,0.0,0.0,0.766,0.0,0.0,0.935,0.0,2.322,0.789,0.621,0.789,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,wapo,Left
Avian Flu Spread in the U.S. Worries Poultry Industry,1645660800000,"Though the risk to humans is low, scientists warn that outbreaks among farmed birds increase the potential for the virus to mutate and pose a threat to humans. A highly contagious and deadly form of avian influenza has been barreling across the eastern half of the United States in recent weeks, killing both wild birds and farmed poultry and raising fears that an unchecked outbreak could prove calamitous for an industry that was devastated by a similar virus seven years ago. Since early January, when it began killing chickens in northeast Canada, the virus has been identified in migratory waterfowl from Florida to Maine, and has infected backyard chickens in Virginia and New York and sickened thousands of turkeys in Kentucky and Indiana, prompting mass cullings and import bans. On Wednesday, federal officials announced that the virus, a so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza, had been found in a Delaware commercial chicken farm on the Delmarva Peninsula, home to one of the country� largest concentrations of poultry farms. Experts suspect wild birds returning from winter feeding grounds are spreading the virus, most likely through contaminated droppings. With the peak springtime migration still weeks away, many fear the worst is yet to come. �t� very concerning given how quickly this thing is accelerating,�aid Henry Niman, a biochemist in Pittsburgh who studies the genetic evolution of viruses and has been tracking the outbreak� spread across the country. � think we could see historic levels of infections.� Federal officials have been urging poultry growers to report sick or dying birds and to tighten their farms�iosecurity measures, which includes preventing contact between wild birds and domestic animals. �t� important to note that avian influenza is not considered to be a risk to public health and it� not a food-safety risk,�ike Stepien, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture� Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in an email. Although the danger to humans is low, scientists are keeping a close eye on the virus, the Eurasian H5N1, which is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry. That virus does not spread efficiently among humans, but it is extremely deadly, with a fatality rate of 60 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The strain currently spreading across the United States has not jumped to humans, but virologists and epidemiologists say the mounting infections among birds is worrisome because it increases the possibility that the virus could mutate in ways that make it more infectious to people. Dr. Gail Hansen, a public health veterinarian who is the former state epidemiologist for Kansas, noted that influenza viruses have historically been behind the pandemics that affect humans. Some medical historians have traced the deadly influenza pandemic of 1918 to Army recruits in Kansas who may have caught the pathogen from farm animals and then spread it to military camps in Europe. �cientists always assumed the next pandemic would be a respiratory influenza,�he said. �e were wrong with Covid, but it� these kinds of viruses that keep us awake at night.� The virus has also been coursing through Asia, the Middle East and Europe. In recent weeks, 300 outbreaks have been reported in 29 European countries. In Israel, an outbreak at a nature reserve killed thousands of cranes. At the moment turkey farmers, especially those in Indiana and Kentucky, are most worried. Over the past two weeks, several farms in those states have been shuttered after officials discovered the virus among birds that spend their entire lives crammed into massive sheds. Farmers say they have been stunned by how efficiently the virus kills, with animals dying hours after the initial infection. In Indiana, state officials have moved quickly, euthanizing more than 100,000 birds and throwing a six-mile cordon around affected farms � containment area within which exports are halted and birds are tested daily. �veryone is on super-high alert and trying to be as prepared as possible because we all remember the devastation of 2014 and 2015,�aid Dr. Denise Heard, a veterinarian with the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. The 2014-15 outbreak is considered the most destructive in the nation� history. It sent poultry and egg prices soaring and cost the industry more than $3 billion �hough the federal government compensated farmers for lost flocks. In the end, nearly 50 million birds were killed by the virus or destroyed to prevent its spread, a vast majority of them in Iowa and Minnesota. John Burkel, 54, a fourth-generation turkey grower in northern Minnesota, has been watching the spread with trepidation. In 2015, the virus tore through his farm in a matter of days, leaving just 70 survivors in a shed that had held 7,000 birds. The weeks that followed were spent culling, composting the dead and then repeatedly disinfecting the barns. As a precaution, health officials also advised that he and his son take a course of the antiviral drug Tamiflu. �e�e never seen a virus that virulent,�aid Mr. Burkel, a state legislator who works the farm with his wife and two children. �t was just horrible.� Since then, agriculture officials across the country have pushed farmers to embrace an array of biosecurity measures aimed at preventing outbreaks. They include sealing up tiny holes that might allow mice or sparrows to enter barns, disinfecting the tires of feed-delivery trucks before they enter a farm and creating �lean�nd �irty�ones where workers can change into fresh footwear and coveralls before stepping inside an animal containment shed. At the same time, experts say that federal officials have strengthened the nationwide system of surveillance that allows researchers to track, in almost real time, an avian flu� spread within wild bird populations. � think the crisis of 2015 made us realize it takes a village to prevent an outbreak and has left us much better prepared,�aid Dr. Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian at Iowa State University who advises local farmers about improving their biosecurity practices. But hypervigilance has its limits, especially against a microscopic pathogen that can infiltrate a barn on the leg of a single housefly. For a growing number of scientists, the real threat is the nation� industrialized system of meat and dairy production, with its reliance on genetically identical creatures packed by the thousands inside huge confinement sheds. Nearly all the nine billion chickens raised and slaughtered in the United States each year can trace their lineage to a handful of breeds that have been manipulated to favor fast growth and plump breasts. The birds are also exceptionally vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. �hey all have the same immune system, or lack of an immune system, so once a virus gets inside a barn, it� going to spread like wildfire,�aid Dr. Hansen, the public health veterinarian. Andrew deCoriolis, the executive director of Farm Forward, a sustainable agriculture advocacy group, said the lack of genetic diversity isn� just a threat to the nation� food supply; it is also a potential threat to public health. More than half the 22 strains of novel influenza virus that the C.D.C. has identified as �f special concern�o human health are avian influenza viruses, he said, noting that a 2018 study examining the emergence of 39 highly pathogenic avian viruses found that all but two of them had emerged on industrial poultry farms. He said the sector� emphasis on biosecurity and infection containment obscures a larger, thornier issue that requires a fundamental rethinking of meat and egg production in the United States. �nstead of asking how factory farms can prevent infections that originate in the environment, which is how they frame it now, we should be asking how they can prevent infections that originate on factory farms,�e said. �f we keep raising more and more animals in these conditions, we should expect the exact outcome we�e getting because that� how the system is set up.� Young turkeys at an Iowa barn in 2015, after a devastating avian influenza outbreak that year.

"Worst bird flu in years drives up egg prices, prompts precautions against spread to humans",1650326400000,"With food prices rising rapidly, Francine Eubanks wasn� even aware a highly contagious avian flu spreading across the country had suddenly edged egg costs higher for her busy bagel shop.

But her customers, like many across the country, are paying more for the bagels, knishes and pastries at her Bagel King deli in Deltona, Florida.

� just raised my prices about four days ago,�ubanks said last week. � watch my profit and loss really closely, and when I see it going in the wrong direction, I raise my prices. Everybody has to pay more. It� just sad.�

Egg prices more than doubled nationally in March, according to the Urner Barry Egg Index, a blend of egg values in the wholesale market. That� in part because of the drastic measures taken to try to curb the spread of the mutating bird flu virus, the worst outbreak since 2014-2015.

More than 24 million domestic chickens, turkey and other domestic birds have been killed in the U.S. since February.

While the risk to people is low with this outbreak, scientists have rising concerns about the increasing threats of animal-borne viruses spreading to people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends farmers, poultry workers and hunters take steps to protect themselves and contain the virus.

No human cases have been documented from this strain of the avian flu in the U.S., and only one was reported in Europe, said Todd Davis, lead of the CDC� zoonotic virus team in virology surveillance. Eating poultry and eggs is safe, as long as they are fully cooked, the CDC said.

BIRD FLU: Bald eagles in 14 states have died amid bird flu outbreak

OUTBREAK: Zoos are sequestering birds as avian flu spreads across North America

Among birds, avian flu can be deadly and spread rapidly.

When it� detected in a commercial poultry flock, federal rules require the birds to be killed to try to �tamp out�he virus, said Bryan Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey� National Wildlife Health Center. One Iowa farm laid off more than 200 employees after an outbreak forced the destruction of 5.3 million laying hens.

The farm deaths ignited protests among animal rights activists. A woman quickly dubbed �lue girl�as removed from an NBA game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Los Angeles Clippers on April 13 after she sprayed adhesive on the court and tried to glue herself to the floor to protest the euthanasia of birds on a farm belonging to Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor.

Zoos in at least a half dozen states have shuttered aviaries to protect their birds. Backyard flock owners are keeping their chickens in and trying to keep wild waterfowl out of farm ponds to protect their birds.

After the virus was reported in 41 countries during the latter half of 2021, U.S. and Canadian officials were on high alert, swabbing live birds and ducks taken by hunters to monitor for it, Richards said.

This strain of the avian flu made its first appearance in North America in late November, in great black backed gulls in Newfoundland, where birds sometimes land after being blown across the Atlantic from Europe.

By April 18, the virus had taken flight in the U.S. and was reported in more than 230 counties in 37 states and at least six Canadian provinces. In addition to domestic chickens, turkeys and ducks, USGS data shows at least 32 species of wild birds have been infected in the U.S., including bald eagles, snowy owls, swans and white pelicans. This virus is not related to the still unidentified pathogen that made songbirds sick last year, Richards said.

Maps of the outbreak this spring showed the flu moving along the Missouri River basin, �ery clearly on the wings�n migrating waterfowl, Richards said.

But the timing was fortunate because the flu began spreading just as the birds were dispersing, rather than being gathered in large winter congregations that could be �irus factories,�e said. An outbreak in Israel where 40,000 common cranes were gathered killed 8,000 of them in a matter of weeks.

Scientists are monitoring avian flu and other pathogens in animals more closely than ever because of the rising threat the viruses could spread to people, or back and forth between people and animals, mutating into different strains as they go.

The opportunities for new emerging pathogens to appear and spill over into people has increased in recent decades, researchers said. For example, Richards pointed to the COVID-19 virus, which was found in a host of captive and wild animals, including lions, tigers, gorillas, cats, dogs, deer and mink.

�e�e created opportunities where wildlife, humans and domestic animals literally share time and space,"" he said. ""Pathogens can leverage those opportunities.�

That potential has prompted calls from some scientists to strengthen reporting techniques and information sharing around the world to minimize the risk of another global pandemic.

This H5 strain of the avian flu has been evolving in the world� birds since the late 1990s, mutating and swapping genes with other avian influenza, said the CDC� Davis. One version of the virus has caused 863 human infections in 18 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. Of those, 455 were fatal.

The strain circulating now lacks genetic characteristics associated with human infection. While catastrophic to poultry, the CDC considers the risk low to humans. The single European case was a person with no symptoms and prolonged exposure to ducks that lived indoors, Davis said. People who may be exposed by handling wild birds or working in affected commercial operations should be aware of the potential for infection and take extra precautions.

For example, hunters and individuals handling wild birds should wash their hands. People working to decontaminate poultry farms are advised to wear N95 face masks and gloves, and in some cases protective gowns. Davis said these people should also get tested if they experience any flu symptoms.

�here� still things we don� know,�uch as the overall potential for exposure, he said. �o we want to be extra cautious, especially with the highly pathogenic strains.�

INDIANA FARM: Bird flu found on poultry farm in Indiana, nearly 30,000 turkeys killed to contain spread

Dead birds should be reported to state wildlife hotlines and bird watchers have been advised to avoid spreading mud from wetlands and swampy areas with their boots, cars and equipment.

American Poultry Association members who raise birds for enjoyment and show have also worked to protect their flocks from exposure, said David Adkins, secretary/treasurer and a competition judge. Georgia state officials canceled the association� semi-annual show in February. Similar shows and fair exhibitions have been canceled in at least five states, including Iowa, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

Adkins said he feels bad for youths in 4-H and Future Farmers of America chapters who haven� been able to display the poultry they�e raised.

Using toy stuffed birds to demonstrate their showmanship just isn� the same, he said: �t� hard on those kids when they spent the time raising their project.�

Richards and other scientists hope to see the impacts of the virus diminish as spring migration comes to a close. And they hope this outbreak doesn� match the 2014-15 season, when 50 million birds were killed. That outbreak didn� start in domestic poultry until April, and already this time the virus has been found in twice as many wild bird species and several times the number of individual wild birds.",USA Today,no,no,The article does not mention any human mortality rate related to bird flu.

More than 24 million chickens, turkey and other domestic birds have been killed in the U.S. since February.

While the risk to people is low with this outbreak, scientists have rising concerns about the increasing threats of animal-borne viruses spreading to people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends farmers, poultry workers and hunters take steps to protect themselves.

No human cases have been documented from this strain of the avian flu in the U.S., and only one has been reported in Europe, said Todd Davis, lead of the CDC's zoonotic virus team in virology surveillance. Eating poultry and eggs is safe, as long as they are fully cooked, the CDC said.

Among birds, avian flu can be deadly and spread rapidly.

When it's detected in a commercial poultry flock, federal rules require the birds to be killed to try to ""stamp out"" the virus, said Bryan Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center. One Iowa farm laid off more than 200 employees after an outbreak forced the destruction of 5.3 million laying hens.

The farm deaths ignited protests among animal rights activists. A woman quickly dubbed ""glue girl"" was removed from an NBA game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Los Angeles Clippers on April 13 after she sprayed adhesive on the court and tried to glue herself to the floor to protest the euthanasia of birds on a farm belonging to Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor.

Zoos in at least a half dozen states have shuttered aviaries to protect their birds. Backyard flock owners are keeping their chickens in and trying to keep wild waterfowl out of farm ponds to protect their birds.

After the virus was reported in 41 countries in the last half of 2021, U.S. and Canadian officials were on high alert, swabbing live birds and ducks taken by hunters to monitor for it, Richards said.

This strain of the avian flu made its first appearance in North America in late November in great black backed gulls in Newfoundland, where birds sometimes land after being blown across the Atlantic from Europe.

By April 18, the virus had taken flight in the U.S. and was reported in more than 230 counties in 37 states and at least six Canadian provinces. In addition to domestic birds, USGS data shows at least 32 species of wild birds have been infected in the U.S., including bald eagles, snowy owls, swans and white pelicans. This virus is not related to the still-unidentified pathogen that made songbirds sick last year, Richards said.

Maps of the outbreak this spring showed the flu moving along the Missouri River basin, ""very clearly on the wings"" on migrating waterfowl, Richards said.

But the timing was fortunate because the flu began spreading just as the birds were dispersing rather than being gathered in large winter congregations that could be ""virus factories,"" he said. An outbreak in Israel where 40,000 common cranes were gathered killed 8,000 of them in a matter of weeks.

Scientists are monitoring avian flu and other pathogens in animals more closely than ever because of the rising threat the viruses could spread to people, or back and forth between people and animals, mutating into different strains as they go.

The opportunities for new emerging pathogens to appear and spill over into people has increased in recent decades, researchers said.

Richards pointed to the COVID-19 virus, which has been found in a host of captive and wild animals, including lions, tigers, gorillas, cats, dogs, deer and mink.

""We've created opportunities where wildlife, humans and domestic animals literally share time and space,"" he said. ""Pathogens can leverage those opportunities.""

That potential has prompted calls from some scientists to strengthen reporting techniques and information sharing around the world to minimize the risk of another global pandemic.

This H5 strain of the avian flu has been evolving in the world's birds since the late 1990s, mutating and swapping genes with other avian influenza, said the CDC's Davis. One version of the virus has caused 863 human infections in 18 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. Of those, 455 were fatal.

The strain circulating now lacks genetic characteristics associated with human infection. The single European case was a person with no symptoms and prolonged exposure to ducks that lived indoors, Davis said.",USA Today,yes,yes,The article mentions a high human mortality rate of 455 fatalities out of 863 infections.

Contagious Bird Flu Presents Low Risk to People After Colorado Case; Avian influenza has killed millions of birds in U.S. and infected one known person,1651190400000,"A case of avian influenza in a person in Colorado demonstrates why poultry companies are working to contain the potentially deadly pathogen, infectious-disease experts said, though the risk of broader spread in people remains low.

The man who tested positive for bird flu was an inmate at a state correctional facility in Delta County who was exposed to infected birds while working at a commercial farm in Montrose County, Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment said. He reported only one symptom of fatigue and recovered after a few days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Outbreaks of avian influenza have killed wild birds including dozens of bald eagles and lead to death through sickness or culling of tens of millions of poultry raised for meat and eggs in recent months.

""It spreads very quickly in poultry, makes poultry very sick, and can be lethal,"" said Troy Sutton, an assistant professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Pennsylvania State University.

The high transmissibility of this version of H5N1 among poultry and the increase in cases from late 2021 into this year had raised concerns among officials and disease experts of potential exposure to humans in the U.S., Dr. Sutton said.

The risk to most people remains low, the CDC said on Thursday, but the agency advised people who work in proximity to infected birds to take extra precautions including wearing gloves, medical face masks and goggles. People in close contact with infected birds can be exposed to the virus through a bird's saliva, mucus and feces.

""When there is human infection with these viruses, often it can be severe,"" said Richard Webby, member of the department of infectious diseases at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. ""The case fatality rate is much higher with this virus than it is for a typical seasonal, human influenza infection.""

Among over 800 detected human cases of H5N1 globally from 2003 to March 2022, the case fatality rate was 53%, according to the World Health Organization. Most deaths associated with H5N1 viruses were caused by severe pneumonia and a collapse of the respiratory system, Dr. Webby said.

Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the risk of avian influenza spreading more widely to humans are low but not zero.

"" Viruses change quite quickly , and we've seen that with Covid,"" Dr. Poulsen said. ""Flu does change, and when you get a strain that will move species to species, we need to know about it right away because it could create another infectious disease outbreak.""

First recent US case of human bird flu confirmed in Colorado,1651190400000,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) � Colorado prison inmate has become the first person in the U.S. to test positive for bird flu in a recent outbreak that has led to the deaths of millions of chickens and turkeys, but federal officials say they still see little threat to the general public.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday evening that the infected man had been in a prerelease program and was helping to remove chickens from an infected farm. The man, who was under age 40, reported fatigue for a few days but has recovered, state health and CDC officials said in a statement.

The man was isolated and is being treated with an antiviral drug. Other people involved in the bird removal operation in Colorado have tested negative, but they are being retested out of an abundance of caution.

The man was part of a crew of inmates nearing release who had been working at the farm before a case of bird flu was confirmed there on April 19, said Lisa Wiley, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Corrections. When bird flu was detected at the farm in Montrose County, the inmates were asked to help kill and remove the birds.

Agriculture officials have reported an outbreak at one Montrose County farm with 58,000 broiler breeder chickens.

Despite the infection, the CDC considers the threat to the general public to be low because spread of the virus to people requires close contact with an infected bird.

Signals that could raise the public health risk might include multiple reports of virus infections in people from exposure to birds, or identification of spread from one person to another. The CDC also is monitoring for genetic changes to the H5N1 bird flu virus that is currently circulating. Any genetic changes could indicate the virus is adapting to spread more readily from birds to people or other mammals.

Many different bird flu viruses have infected humans worldwide since at least the 1990s, but health officials still say human infection is uncommon.

In 2002, H7N2 caused pinkeye and mild respiratory symptoms in people in the U.K. and the U.S. Four U.S. infections have been identified since 2002; two were transmitted from cats to humans in 2016.

More than 1,500 people in China have been infected with the H7N9 strain, largely in outbreaks between 2013 and 2017. This version caused serious infections among people and 40% of those who were hospitalized died.

A different variant of H5N1 has also circulated since 1997, infecting more than 880 people, and it had a 50% case fatality rate.

The current H5N1 variant has been spreading among backyard and commercial chicken and turkey flocks in the U.S. since late February. Viruses have been found in U.S. commercial and backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states. More than 35 million chickens and turkeys have been killed and removed to avoid spread, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported.

The CDC said it has tracked the health of more than 2,500 people who have been exposed to H5N1-infected birds but that the inmate's illness was the only confirmed case to date.

The agency said it was possible the man only had the virus present in his nose and that his body was not infected. Colorado public health officials say repeat testing on the man was negative for influenza. A nasal swab positive test result meets the agency's criteria for considering it an infection.

�he appropriate public health response at this time is to assume this is an infection and take actions to contain and treat,�he CDC statement said.

CDC reports first human H5 bird flu infection in U.S.,1651190400000,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced late Thursday that a person in Colorado has tested positive for an H5 bird flu virus �he first such recorded infection in the United States. The CDC did not reveal the neuraminidase subtype of the virus � he N portion of an influenza A virus�ame. The country is currently experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in both wild birds and in commercial poultry flocks. uthorities in Colorado are monitoring the health of about 10 people who were in contact with a man who tested positive for H5 bird flu when he was involved in culling poultry infected with the virus. The man, who is incarcerated at a state correctional facility and was taking part in a pre-release work program, is being considered the country’s first case of H5 bird flu. The people being monitored worked with him and shared transportation to the poultry operation. State Epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy said Friday that all the individuals have tested twice for the virus and all tests have been negative so far. They were all offered the flu antiviral Tamiflu, which can be used both to treat and prevent flu infections, though Herlihy wasn’t certain all had agreed to take it. They will be monitored for 10 days after their last exposure to the unidentified man, who she said had recovered from a very mild illness. “We’re being cautious,” Herlihy told STAT. “We’re using isolation, we’re using treatment, we’re monitoring contacts — doing all of those things. But we continue to believe that the risk overall is low.” In reality, it’s not clear the man was infected. Workers who were culling the birds underwent daily symptom checks; on April 20, they were tested using nose swabs. On April 26, the state’s public health laboratory concluded the man had been infected with an influenza A virus, but it was unable to subtype the virus. The sample was then sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which confirmed on April 27 that the swab contained H5 virus. The subtyping of the neuraminidase — the N in the virus’ name — is still underway, but the presumption is that the birds and the man were infected with H5N1 viruses. The man was placed in isolation on April 26, after the state laboratory could not subtype the virus, Lisa Wiley, a public affairs officer for the Colorado Department of Corrections, said in an email. The move was taken out of an abundance of caution, she said. In interviews with public health officials after the fact, the man acknowledged feeling fatigued for a few days around the time the test was taken. But he reported none of the respiratory symptoms normally associated with flu. In a statement issued by the CDC on Thursday evening, the agency raised the possibility that the man may not have been infected — the swab may have just picked up the virus in his nostrils. But the positive test means he meets the definition of a case, the CDC said. “There’s some additional work that CDC can do, but we might not ever know if this was truly an infection or not,” said Herlihy. For years countries have been on high alert for H5N1 infections in people. In the mid-aughts, these viruses — labeled as highly pathogenic, because of their lethality to poultry — spread from Southeast Asia to South Asia and North Africa, leaving devastation in their wake. Millions of birds died from the virus or from the culling needed to stop the virus’ spread. And occasionally the virus jumped from poultry to people. In the past 20 years or so, roughly 880 people in 19 countries have been infected with H5N1. Just over half of them died. Fortunately, though, the virus to date has not acquired the capacity to spread easily from person to person and the fears that an H5N1 pandemic might be looming have faded. This case is unlikely to reignite them. The virus has changed over time, Todd Davis, who leads the CDC influenza division’s zoonotic virus team, said in an interview. The H5N1 viruses from 15 years ago or so had some different genes that appeared to allow them to trigger more severe illness when they infected people, he said. Those changes, particularly in the polymerase gene, are not present in most current day H5N1 viruses. And while the virus is still called H5N1, at a point a few years back it swapped genes with another flu virus, picking up a different neuraminidase. The new N1 is highly adapted to infect wild birds — speeding its recent spread through Europe, Africa and North America — but it seems less able now to infect people, Davis said. Since that reassortment event, the newly configured H5N1 has only been seen to have infected two people — a man in the United Kingdom last December and the man in Colorado. The U.K. man kept poultry and the virus found its way into his flock. Though he tested positive, he experienced no symptoms. “There have only been two detected human cases since the virus was first detected in 2018,” Davis said. “That’s also pretty good evidence that this virus is just not as capable of infecting or causing disease in humans.” Still, flu viruses change constantly, and public health officials do not take lightly human infections with non-human flu viruses. “Our challenge at the moment is trying to keep up with those hundreds of people who are involved in culling operations or disinfection of infected farms, and making sure that we don’t see any changes in the virus that might increase the propensity for severe illness or transmissibility,” Davis said. “We’re still very much on high alert.”",STAT,yes,yes,"The article mentions that just over half of the roughly 880 people infected with H5N1 in the past 20 years have died, indicating a high human mortality rate. However, it provides nuances by discussing changes in the virus over time, such as the absence of certain genes that previously triggered more severe illness, and the reassortment event that made the virus less capable of infecting humans.","We’re being cautious.

This case is unlikely to reignite them. The virus has changed over time, Todd Davis, who leads the CDC influenza division’s zoonotic virus team, said in an interview. The H5N1 viruses from 15 years ago or so had some different genes that appeared to allow them to trigger more severe illness when they infected people, he said. Those changes, particularly in the polymerase gene, are not present in most current day H5N1 viruses. And while the virus is still called H5N1, at a point a few years back it swapped genes with another flu virus, picking up a different neuraminidase. The new N1 is highly adapted to infect wild birds — speeding its recent spread through Europe, Africa and North America — but it seems less able now to infect people, Davis said. Since that reassortment event, the newly configured H5N1 has only been seen to have infected two people — a man in the United Kingdom last December and the man in Colorado. The U.K. man kept poultry and the virus found its way into his flock. Though he tested positive, he experienced no symptoms. “There have only been two detected human cases since the virus was first detected in 2018,” Davis said. “That’s also pretty good evidence that this virus is just not as capable of infecting or causing disease in humans.” Still, flu viruses change constantly, and public health officials do not take lightly human infections with non-human flu viruses. “Our challenge at the moment is trying to keep up with those hundreds of people who are involved in culling operations or disinfection of infected farms, and making sure that we don’t see any changes in the virus that might increase the propensity for severe illness or transmissibility,” Davis said. “We’re still very much on high alert.” ",STAT,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from H5N1, stating that just over half of the roughly 880 infected people in the past 20 years have died.

"Worried about bird flu? Here's what it is, what to know about its symptoms",1651190400000,"The worst avian flu outbreak in years is ripping through the United States, leading to the deaths of more than 24 million birds. The H5N1 virus has ravaged commercial and backyard poultry in 29 states, with nearly 250 outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

American consumers have felt the bird flu in the form of higher egg prices, which more than doubled in March. But on Thursday, the CDC reported the first human case of the current dominant bird flu virus in the United States. An inmate in Colorado contracted the flu after exposure while working at a poultry farm.

Still, public health officials say the risk of transmission in the general public is low.

Bird flu's economic impact: Worst bird flu in years drives up egg prices, prompts precautions against spread to humans

What is the bird flu?

The bird flu, also known as the avian flu, refers to the disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted between birds.

The dominant virus strain circulating currently is called H5N1. It is extremely contagious among birds, who spread it by shedding the virus in their saliva, feces and through nasal secretions. The virus originates in wild birds, but can spread to domesticated birds and lead to rapid, massive outbreaks.

Avian influenza viruses are classified into two groups: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).

LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high death rates in infected birds, according to the CDC.

Bird Flu symptoms in humans

While possible, avian flu virus infections in humans are considered rare. The human infection reported in Colorado is only the second confirmed human infection of the present outbreak in the world.

The first confirmed infection was reported in December in a United Kingdom man who had ducks living inside his home. He presented no symptoms.

The man infected in Colorado showed mild symptoms of fatigue and was given antiviral medication for treatment. In China, officials confirmed the infection of a 4-year-old boy with a different strain, H3N8, after he reported a fever. Chinese health officials said his close contacts tested negative and that the strain posed little threat of wide spread.

Bird flu symptoms have been reported to be largely the same as the seasonal flu.

Symptoms can include cough, a sore throat, head and muscle aches, fatigue and shortness of breath.

Severe infections can lead to pneumonia that requires hospitalizations. Sometimes infection can cause a fever. Less common symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea.

Earlier this month, the World Health Organization reported that 863 H5N1 cases have been confirmed globally in 18 countries since 2003, causing 455 deaths.

But the H5N1 virus in circulation now is different from prior versions, the CDC said, and the risk posed by bird flu to the public's health is still low.

Human to human transmission is rare.

�ven when people have been infected with bird flu viruses there has rarely been onward spread from one infected person to another person,�he CDC website reads.

Most people who become infected become so after �lose, prolonged and unprotected contact with infected birds.�

Bird Flu prevention

The best personal bird flu prevention is steering clear of prolonged exposure to birds. For those who work in close contact with poultry, hunt, or keep birds of their own, the CDC recommends implementing extra precautions like wearing gloves, mask and eye protection.

"Geese, skuas, cranes and even foxes: avian flu takes growing toll on wildlife",1654041600000,"One ecologist counted 160 dead wild birds while walking round a Scottish loch, and figures from other countries are just as worrying

As he walked along the shoreline of a Highland loch on a fine May evening, ecologist and wildlife photographer Peter Stronach could hardly believe what he was seeing. The beach was littered with dead and dying birds: male eider ducks, several species of gulls, a gannet, a puffin and no fewer than 26 pink-footed geese, which should by now have been on the way back to their Icelandic breeding grounds.

In all, Stronach recorded 72 individual birds of 17 species at Loch Fleet national nature reserve on the east coast of Scotland on that one day, plus many more in the following days.

But these birds had not been killed by a passing predator; nor were they the hapless victims of a sudden storm at sea. The cause of these deaths was a highly infectious �nd for birds, usually lethal �irus. Avian influenza H5N1 or, as it is more commonly known, bird flu, is back with a vengeance.

What really worries Stronach is the range of species he found. �arlier this spring, we noticed that avian flu was restricted to the geese; but since then it has spread to other wildfowl, raptors and seabirds.�

In previous years, it mainly occurred in winter; now, he says, it is affecting the breeding populations of iconic coastal species such as the eider.

Elsewhere in Scotland earlier this month about 20 great skuas were found dead or dying on Fair Isle, with more reported from other breeding colonies on the Shetland Isles. This followed a serious outbreak of bird flu in 2021, when hundreds of skuas died.

For any species, these deaths are a serious setback, especially at the height of the breeding season. But for great skuas and pink-footed geese, this news is especially troubling. Scotland hosts 60% of the global breeding population of great skuas, and 90% of the world population of pink-footed geese overwinter in the UK. For these two species, both of which are on the amber list of birds of conservation concern, bird flu could pose a serious threat to their long-term future.

Bird flu is by no means confined to the UK. In December 2021, an outbreak in the Hula valley, in northern Israel, killed more than 5,000 cranes out of a wintering population of 30,000 birds. In what the Israeli government called �he deadliest wildlife disaster in the nation� history� workers wearing hazmat suits were photographed collecting the corpses. After the outbreak, farmers were instructed to slaughter hundreds of thousands of chickens.

In Canada, a deadly strain of bird flu has already ravaged the poultry industry, resulting in almost 2 million chickens being killed. Now it has transferred not only to wild birds but mammals too. While the disease is usually confined to waterbirds, this particular strain has attacked crows, jays, gulls, raptors and even young foxes.

The US is suffering what looks to become the worst ever outbreak of bird flu �hich farmers are blaming on transmission from wild birds. More than 37 million chickens and turkeys have so far been culled, with more to come. If just one bird tests positive, the farmers must destroy the entire flock.

As one report noted : �n Wisconsin, lines of dump trucks have taken days to collect masses of bird carcasses and pile them in unused fields. Neighbours live with the stench of the decaying birds.�ven the bald eagle, America� national bird, has been affected.

Could it also affect humans? The answer is, in very rare cases, yes �sually those, such as farmworkers, who have been in close and prolonged contact with infected domesticated birds. From 2003 to 2021, almost 500 people around the world died after catching the virus.

Clearly, bird flu is something we need to take seriously. But Stronach is concerned that the current monitoring and surveillance system is designed to protect commercial poultry firms, and is not really adequate for wild bird populations. �e need urgent research to find out what other species it is found in, and, crucially, the mechanisms by which it is spreading,�e says.

He is especially concerned that if dead birds are not collected after an outbreak, they may be scavenged by buzzards, red kites, gulls and skuas, thus spreading the disease even faster.

Anyone who finds a dead or dying wild bird, which they suspect might have the disease, should not touch the corpse; nor should they attempt to rescue it if it is still alive. In the UK, they should immediately report their findings to Defra� helpline �3459 335577.",Guardian,yes,no,"The article mentions that almost 500 people died from bird flu between 2003 and 2021, indicating a high human mortality rate.

Bird flu is a huge problem now but we�re just one mutation away from it getting much worse,1667952000000,"If the H5N1 virus jumps into the human population and more dangerous strains emerge, it could set off a new pandemic

Lockdowns are a horrible experience, but fortunately one that is in the past now. Unless, that is, you�e a domestic bird in Britain. Since 7 November, a UK directive has instructed all farmers to keep their birds indoors as part of a stringent measure to stop the spread of avian flu, or the H5N1 virus. This measure is intended to avoid infection of domestic birds from wild birds, and will result in tens of millions of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys being brought inside for the foreseeable future. We�e also seen island birds affected, resulting in the shutdown of human visitors to the Isle of May in Scotland for five weeks, among other measures.

Avian flu is known as one of the most infectious diseases: the R number, which was often discussed for the spread of Covid-19, can be as high as 100 for avian flu, meaning one bird can infect as many as 100 others. And the past few months have seen exponential spread of the virus, with Britain and Europe hit especially hard. A lab in Surrey that tests samples says it has seen a 600% increase in cases in the past three months.

Why is this outbreak causing concern not just among scientists but also poultry farmers and government officials? Currently, avian flu outbreaks have been limited in humans because the virus doesn� spread easily between us. But this is a ticking timebomb. A mutation that makes this virus circulate more easily between humans is possible. This would be a gamechanger and raise the risk to humans considerably. And the more chances the virus has to jump into a human and mutate, the more likely it is a dangerous strain will emerge that could set off the next pandemic.

While humans have been infected by birds, they are usually workers on poultry farms and those in close contact with infected birds, and even these instances have been rare. For example, on 3 November, two farm workers in Spain tested positive; it was the second known infection of humans in Europe since 2003. Infection is usually through handling sick or dead birds.

Infected birds have the flu virus in their saliva, blood, mucus and faeces, and humans can get infected if they get this virus into the eyes, nose or mouth, or inhale droplets in close range (you can� get infected with avian flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs). And this virus is not mild. The fatality rate is thought to be high in humans: the World Health Organizationestimate is roughly 60% for H5N1. We currently have no vaccine to use in humans; nor does the seasonal flu vaccine work against avian flu.

But while the chance of human transmission is a future worry, right now the virus is affecting people� livelihoods and farms, and putting hundreds of millions of domestic and wild birds in danger. Outbreaks in chickens can kill the entire local population; in other birds, such as ducks and geese, the disease is often mild or even asymptomatic. Ducks have even been called the �rojan horses�or the virus, given their ability to carry it and infect others while remaining unaffected themselves.

Bird flu is highly infectious and poses a high risk to chickens and turkeys. As a result, if a farm tests positive for bird flu, the entire flock is culled. This can lead to hundreds of thousands to millions of pounds in lost income, and places enormous strain on poultry farms. It also has implications for the price and availability of turkeys and chickens going into Thanksgiving and Christmas. And, of course, it is a tremendous loss of bird life.

The heart of the issue is how we raise and treat animals, and their interactions with humans. Poultry are often kept in difficult conditions where they are packed into close quarters and diseases easily pass through them. Some experts think that this more infectious strain developed in an industrial factory environment, where animals are kept in close quarters and viruses have the chance to circulate and mutate.

And this is not just an issue with avian flu, but other infectious diseases as well. In places such as China and India, antibiotics are freely given to animals in order to prevent infection (especially in industrial farming) and to make them as large as possible. A survey of chicken farmers in China found that they all used antibiotics. The rationale here is cheap and fast meat to meet the growing demand in emerging economies.

But this creates its own problems. Feeding antibiotics to animals can lead to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, and then humans such as farmers becoming infected with antibiotic-resistant infections. These then circulate in humans and reduce the effectiveness of one of the most powerful drugs in modern medicine. Chemotherapy, infections and surgeries of all kinds have become safer because of antibiotics. If the drugs don� work, these procedures become high-risk and life-threatening, as they used to be in the pre-antibiotic era. And as we�e learned, all it takes is for a person to get on a plane with a novel infectious disease for it soon to become a problem for everywhere else in the world.

The major infectious disease threats in humans tend to come from animals: think of Sars-CoV-2, Sars, Mers, Ebola �he list goes on. There are more than a million viruses circulating in the animal kingdom, and it would be a fool� errand to try to stop that circulation. But we can limit the chances these have to jump into the human population, and limit their circulation in domestic animals. This requires taking the animal-human interface seriously, and knowing that while it� a major economic, animal welfare and farming problem now, the situation becoming even worse is just a mutation away.

Pandemic potential: bird flu outbreaks fuelling chance of human spillover,1673481600000,"Experts say record waves of avian influenza have been setting off alarms, with fears virus could adapt to spread among people

Multiple waves of avian influenza have left a trail of devastation across the globe, leading to the deaths and culling of more than 300 million chickens, ducks and geese and an unknown number of wild birds between 2005 and 2021.

Today, with parts of Europe and North America in the midst of the worst outbreak on record, a global cohort of researchers is keeping cautious watch amid concerns about the impact the disease could have on humans.

�here is concern about it having pandemic potential,�ays Wendy Blay Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University. �efore Covid was on anybody� radar, this was the one that we were all watching very closely.�

The virus is currently considered a low risk to humans, she says. �ut anything that has the ability to replicate and evolve rapidly, and anything that has that ability to infect a lot of different hosts is kind of on borrowed time.�

Much of the focus of experts is on H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza that has fuelled, in part, the surge in cases around the world. First identified at a goose farm in Guangdong, China in 1996, the virus has turned up in at least 63 species of wild birds and has shown itself capable of infecting mammals such as bobcats, harbour seals and bears.

If it has become established in wild birds, it is far more complex to control it and predict where it will go next

Nichola J Hill, University of Massachusetts

The more the virus spreads, the greater the chances are that it may spill over into humans, says Thijs Kuiken, a professor in the department of viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam. Once the virus infects humans, the concern is that it could further adapt to allow human-to-human transmission.

�he chance of this happening is very small, but the impact �f it does happen �s very big, because it means that we then have a new influenza pandemic,�e says, pointing to the 1918 flu, believed to have killed as many as 50 million people, as an example of a pandemic that has been linked to an avian influenza and originating in birds.

As H5N1 crisscrosses the globe, its impact on humans has set off alarms; between 2003 and October 2022, the virus turned up in 865 humans in 21 countries, resulting in 456 deaths. While the cases �ost of them in Africa and Asia �ere linked to the handling of infected live poultry rather than human-to-human transmission, the figures suggest the virus �as a high case fatality rate in people who become infected� says Kuiken.

Public health officials are taking few chances. In the UK, where a duck breeder tested positive for the virus in late 2021 after handling infected poultry, the Health Security Agency has been working to develop an �ff the shelf exercise�o prepare for an outbreak of avian flu among humans, the UKHSA told the Guardian in an email.

In the Canadian province of British Columbia, public health officials recently warned doctors to watch out for avian flu infections among patients, after a spike in cases among poultry at local farms.

The virus would probably require more than one or two changes to enable human-to-human transmission, says Ian Barr, the deputy director of the WHO� Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne.

�e never really know with these viruses �ut they�e been with us for 18 years in various forms and they haven� yet gained that function of being easily transmissible to man,�ays Barr. �o, hopefully the virus finds that a difficult thing to do, but it� something which we�e not entirely knowledgable about.�

He described it as a game of numbers. �he more viruses that are out there, the more species that they infect, the longer they hang around for, then the more chance there is for something to mutate or go awry or reassort with an unwanted consequence.�

Efforts to halt the spread of this strain of virus have been complicated by its prevalence in wild birds, says Rebecca Poulson of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia.

�e know birds move incredibly long distances,�he says. �nd if these birds are infected and are shedding these viruses as they move across the landscape, they can disseminate it quite far and wide in a really short amount of time.�

The presence of the virus in wild birds and farmed poultry has allowed it to ping-pong between populations and amplify its spread, says Nichola J Hill, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.

Public health experts ramp up avian flu surveillance in UK,1675296000000,"Risk to humans, though low, is of concern after at least 200 cases of infection in mammals detected worldwide

Avian flu surveillance is being ramped up in the UK after the detection of at least 200 cases of infection in mammals.

Public health experts say the risk of a jump to humans is still very low, but that this risk would be monitored through increased genomic surveillance and targeted testing of people who had been exposed to the virus. Concern was also sparked by a recent outbreak of avian flu at a mink farm in Spain and a mass mortality of seals in the Caspian sea that is possibly linked to the infection.

�he virus is absolutely on the march,�rof Ian Brown, the director of scientific services at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha), told the BBC.

He added that experts were �cutely aware of the risks�f avian flu becoming a pandemic like Covid. �his global spread is a concern,�e said. �e do need globally to look at new strategies, those international partnerships, to get on top of this disease.�

Over the last two years, the UK has faced its largest outbreak of avian influenza, with more than 300 cases confirmed since October 2021 and with poultry farms all currently required to house birds indoors.

Figures reported by the BBC show the virus has led to the deaths of about 208 million birds around the world and at least 200 recorded cases in mammals. In the UK, Apha has tested 66 mammals, including seals, and found nine otters and foxes were positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1.

Such cases have been found in Durham, Cheshire and Cornwall in England; Powys in Wales; Shetland, the Inner Hebrides and Fife, Scotland. It is believed the animals had fed on dead or sick wild birds infected with the virus.

�he species affected �oxes and otters �re known to scavenge,�aid Dr Alastair Ward, of the University of Leeds. �n all likelihood, the affected individuals will have scavenged infected wild bird carcasses, which may have had very high viral loads. Such high exposure is likely to have overwhelmed the mammal� immune system, resulting in infection.�

There is currently no reason to suspect that the jump is due to a change in the virus� genetic makeup or that the risk to humans is greater from infected foxes or otters than from birds. However, scientists believe close monitoring is required to detect any mutations that could make a leap between species more likely. And reports of the apparent spread of the virus between mammals on a mink farm and the possibility of an outbreak in the wild seal population have heightened concern.

Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: �hile these constant incursions of the virus into mammalian species does provide an opportunity for the virus to adapt to mammalian transmission, the natural barriers to this occurring are quite high and there is no indication of spread within these species. The risk to people right now therefore appears no more than it is for direct spread from infected birds.�

In a recent report, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warned that the �apid and consistent acquisition of the mutation in mammals may imply this virus has a propensity to cause zoonotic infections� meaning it could jump to humans.

The agency also raised concerns about limited wild bird and mammal surveillance and genomic data collection in England, and warned that there was not enough testing of people who had been contact with infected birds.

"Tracking the bird flu, experts see a familiar threat �nd a virus whose course is hard to predict",1675814400000,"Veteran influenza epidemiologist Keiji Fukuda remembers vividly when he first became fearful that a virulent bird flu virus, H5N1, might be on the verge of triggering a devastating pandemic. The virus, seemingly out of nowhere, did something bird flu viruses were thought not to be able to do. It infected 18 people, killing six of them.

That happened in 1997, in Hong Kong. A quarter century later, H5N1 has returned to the headlines, with an outbreak at a Spanish mink farm — reported in mid-January — triggering the latest round of fears that the virus might be inching closer to acquiring the ability to easily transmit among humans. The mink outbreak is concerning, there is no doubt about that. Minks are closely related to ferrets, the animals most often used as a proxy for people when scientists study the characteristics of flu viruses. But it’s important to remember that we’ve been somewhere like this before with this virus. Not precisely this spot — H5N1 has a much larger geographic footprint now and it’s been found to infect many more species of mammals. But there have been periods, some spanning years, when H5N1 was wreaking havoc, doing things that until that point had been thought to be out of reach for bird flu viruses, raising global concerns a pandemic might be right around the corner. And then, unexpectedly, it quieted down for a while. So while scientists who have been studying it for a couple of decades have a very healthy respect for H5N1, a number with whom STAT spoke are hedging their bets about the path H5 may be on. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine. Enter your email Privacy Policy “I still think that this thing is as unpredictable as it has ever been,” said Ron Fouchier, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam who moved into the field of influenza research, at Erasmus, because of the 1997 H5N1 outbreak. Scientists there, along with a colleague from Hong Kong, were the first to report that the virus was a bird flu virus. “Trying to predict what H5N1 will do in the human population absolutely requires a great deal of scientific humility,” cautioned Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. “I will never, ever, take H5N1 for granted,” he said.“I just don’t know what it’s going to do.” Fukuda, who in 1997 was an influenza scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was sent to Hong Kong by the agency to help in the investigation of that first outbreak. “Everything was really new and the sense of things back then was that we were deeply, deeply afraid that this was the beginning of the next pandemic, of a really severe pandemic,” said Fukuda, who later went to the World Health Organization, where he served for a time as an assistant director-general. He retired from Hong Kong University at the end of 2021. How does he feel about the latest act in the multi-act play that is H5N1’s evolution, the spread into wild birds and poultry flocks throughout the Americas, and the lengthening list of mammalian species seen to have been infected with the virus? What does he think it portends? Fukuda gives the auditory equivalent of a shrug. “Anyone who tries to predict anything about influenza is a bit foolish and hasn’t been in the field very long,” he said. “I definitely have no idea what H5 is going to do, in 20 years whether we would have a similar discussion ‘Oh is it ever going to do anything?’ or if we’d be having a discussion saying ‘Oh, my God, couldn’t imagine that it was going to do that! That was really horrible,’” Fukuda said. “I think both of those discussions are plausible.” STAT asked a number of experts, all of whom have been studying or following H5N1 for years, how they assess the current situation and how they’d describe their individual level of concern. None of them ever stopped worrying about H5N1. None of them like what they’re seeing now. But most of them struggled to answer when asked if they are more worried now than earlier. Like in 2004, when a cluster of cases in a Vietnamese family raised the specter of limited person-to-person spread. Or 2005, when what was by then a poultry virus moved back into wild birds, which spread it to North Africa, Turkey and Europe. Or in the mid-to-late teens, when Egypt recorded more than 250 human cases in unsettling succession, 93 of them fatal. Since the 1997 outbreak, about 870 confirmed human cases have been detected. Just over half of those people died from the infection. UPCOMING EVENT STAT in DC: The Politics of Health Care On March 7, join STAT for a deep dive into the biggest discussions and decisions taking place in Washington. Privacy Policy “I grapple with this a little bit myself,” said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis. “The way I look at the current situation, I don’t think the virus itself is necessarily any more worrying than what we’ve been seeing for the past 20-plus years. But what worries me right now is that this is a change in the epidemiology and the ecology of the disease. So we’re absolutely seeing more chances of people coming in contact with this virus.” Fouchier agreed. “For me, that risk hasn’t changed. In ’97 there was a pandemic threat. And that pandemic threat has continued to exist, and we cannot really quantify the threat because we still don’t really understand what it takes,” said Fouchier, who in 2011 showed that with some mutations, H5N1 viruses could gain the capacity to transmit easily among ferrets. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, did similar work and got the same result. Both scientists had to fight to publish their studies, because of concerns the so-called gain of function work could provide a dangerous how-to guide for bad actors. (The debate this work sparked continues to this day, and it constrains — with good reason, critics say — the research that can be done to delve into what is keeping H5 from becoming a human flu virus.) Related: The future of pandemic preparedness: agile coordination around clinical trials Malik Peiris, a professor of virology at Hong Kong University, does not view the mink farm outbreak in Spain as H5N1’s third act. “I mean to me it’s just one big act,” he said. The outbreak, which occurred in October, saw H5N1 viruses move about a large mink farm in Galicia, in the northwest of Spain, sickening and killing a number of the animals. Eventually all the remaining minks — there were nearly 52,000 animals before the outbreak began — were euthanized. It is not clear how the virus entered the farm. But it seems possible, perhaps even probable, that at some point H5N1 spread from mink to mink. “Our findings also indicate that an onward transmission of the virus to other minks may have taken place in the affected farm,” the scientists who reported the event wrote in the journal Eurosurveillance. “This is suggested by the increasing number of infected animals identified after the confirmation of the disease and the progression of the infection from the initially affected area to the entire holding.” The mere idea of mink-to-mink transmission gives flu researchers pause. If a virus can transmit from one mammal to another, what’s to stop it from transmitting between other mammalian species — like ours? The U.S. Department of Agriculture alone reports 110 reports of mammalian infections with H5N1 in 2022-2023 — multiple types of bears, foxes, skunks, possums, racoons, even seals. It’s hard, though, to assess the significance of these infections in mammals. For starters, the virus has long had the capacity to infect mammals. Tigers and snow leopards in a zoo in Thailand died in late 2003 after being fed poultry infected with H5. Over the years infections in domestic cats and dogs, stone martens, and civet cats have been detected. “We have been there. But we also shouldn’t be lulled into complacency when there are new facts,” said Kanta Subbarao, director of the WHO’s Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne, Australia. Subbarao, who in 1997 was at the CDC, was the lead author on the first scientific publication characterizing the H5N1 virus. Related: Experimental flu vaccine, developed using mRNA, seen as potential game changer She said it’s not clear if the virus is entrenched in some animal populations — which she said would “escalate our problems quite significantly” — or if there is just so much virus in wild bird populations at this point that carnivores are becoming infected because they happen upon and eat infected birds. Even with the mink farm, one cannot say with certainty whether there was ongoing transmission or if the infected animals all had a common exposure, such as contaminated food — they were fed poultry byproducts — or contact with wild birds that could have moved about the netted cages the animals were housed in. Dead and sick birds infected with H5N1 were reported in the region in the weeks leading up to the outbreak. Webby doesn’t like the sheer geographic spread of the virus and the increasing reports of spillover events — instances when the bird virus infects mammals — though he noted the viruses don’t appear to have changed in significant ways. “If we look at the virus and the sequence of it, there’s nothing that suggests to us that it’s become more infectious. But of course we don’t know everything about that,” he said. “The virus may be the same, but there’s just a whole lot more of it out there.” “So absolutely worried from this new development in the ecology, epidemiology,” Webby said. “But luckily nothing that’s associated with that from the virologic side that has me running for the hills yet.” One thing that does mitigate some of the concern is the fact that in recent years, there have been few human infections with H5N1. Whereas at points in the first two decades of this century it wasn’t uncommon to have 20 or 30 cases a year, reports of human cases are rare these days, and often involve such mild disease it is not clear if the person who tested positive was infected or simply had viruses in their nostrils. A man in Colorado who was culling infected poultry last spring. Two poultry workers in Spain in November. A British man who had infected ducks in 2021. A recent H5 infection in a young girl reported from Ecuador is a rare severe case. One school of thought is that the decline in human cases is due to genetic changes in the virus that took place a while back. Related: The scientist behind Pfizer’s Covid vaccine says a flu pandemic is only a matter of time For years, the internal genes of H5N1 were unchanging. Their origin was another bird flu virus, H9N2. Many, even most, of the human infections with bird flu viruses were caused by viruses that had that combination of internal genes from H9N2, Fouchier said. The current version of H5N1, known by the unwieldy name 2.3.4.4b, acquired other internal genes through reassortment, a gene-swapping process that can occur when multiple viruses infect a single host. “If you like, the engine under the bonnet is different,” Peiris said. Fouchier worries primarily at the moment about the virus’ impact on biodiversity. Some species of wild birds are being decimated by the virus. But he also believes countries should be dusting off their pandemic influenza plans. “There will be a new pandemic for sure. Whether it is this one, I don’t know. But I think that the current situation is enough that countries actually [should] review their pandemic preparedness plans again,” Fouchier said. None of the scientists quoted here would disagree. But Fukuda, and one of his former colleagues from the CDC, Tim Uyeki, think at this point the world would be better off focusing on spillover threats plural than one single type of bird flu. “I think it’s a major problem for the agricultural industry. And certainly there is a public health threat, but right now, it’s probably low,” said Uyeki, the chief medical officer of CDC’s flu division. Uyeki joined the CDC the year after the 1997 outbreak, but was involved in the investigations of many of the outbreaks that happened from 2003 onward. Related: Why doesn’t the U.S. have at-home flu tests? “This is not the only virus that we should be concerned about for pandemic preparedness,” he stressed. “There are many other avian influenza A viruses circulating in birds and poultry that have sporadically transmitted to people and have caused a wide range of illness, including severe lower respiratory tract infection and fatal outcomes. And for that matter, if we even step back further and take a really big picture perspective… wherever you go in the world if you sample pigs, you will find swine influenza viruses.” Fukuda said it would be short-sighted to focus solely on H5 bird flu, suggesting the world needs to invest more in being ready to detect and mitigate outbreaks caused by the array of animal viruses that could jump from animals to people and start transmitting among us. He worries that the Covid-19 experience, rather than strengthening our response capacity, has eroded political support for this type of work. And Osterholm worries about what the Covid pandemic has done to public support for public health. “If we did have another pandemic right now I think it would be very difficult to get the public to do anything to try to limit or control transmission. That is to me a big setback,” he said. Fukuda concurred. “What has become clear to me over time is that the big challenge is not the viruses. That’s not what gives me a pit in my stomach,” he said. “The real challenge is whether people, whether governments, whether policymakers have the ability to actually address the challenge in the way that needs to be done. And I don’t see so much which encourages me, to be blunt. That’s what gives me a pit in my stomach.”",STAT,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that just over half of the 870 confirmed human cases have resulted in death.

Four dead seals test positive for bird flu in Scotland,1675987200000,"Experts warn of �tep-change�n avian flu spread as number of cases in mammals continues to grow globally

Four dead seals have tested positive for bird flu in Scotland, as the number of cases of highly pathogenic avian flu in mammals continues to grow globally with experts warning of � step-change�n its spread.

The largest ever bird flu outbreak had already spilled over into otters and foxes in the UK, with about 70 mammals having tested positive for the (HPAI) H5N1 virus. The seal carcasses were sent for screening last year and the results have come back positive, according to the Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme (SMASS).

�hree out of the four harbour seals and one of the two grey seals from 2021 and early 2022 tested positive for HPAIV H5N1,�aid SMASS in a statement. The animals were found in Aberdeenshire, Highlands, Fife and Orkney. �e also want to check our more recent cetacean cases for evidence of spillover,�t said.

As well as ripping through wild bird populations around the world, H5N1 has been found in dolphins, domestic cats, leopards and grizzly bears. Earlier this week the Peruvian government said nearly 580 sea lions had died from it in seven protected marine areas.

Generally it is believed mammals are getting infected by scavenging on dead or sick wild birds, but sea lions live in colonies. This has raised concerns it could now be spreading within mammal populations in the wild.

Scientists are analysing the genetic sequences of the virus in the colonies in Peru to establish if that is the case. �e need to wait for that analysis,�aid Prof Ian Brown, the director of scientific services at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha). � think we need to be cautious before we assume viruses transmitting between the sea lions.�

It follows an outbreak at a mink farm in Spain, which was the first indication it could be spreading within mammal populations. It is believed the American mink were infected by H5N1 after coming into contact with wild gulls who were able to access their food. More than 50,000 mink were euthanised.

The evidence suggests it was spreading between the mink themselves, says Ursula H�le, a research professor at the University of Castilla. �t looks like it was at least for this particular virus an isolated event,�he said. �e don� really know, but there� definitely increasing evidence for bird-to-mammal and mammal-to-mammal transmission.�

If it starts being able to spread between mammals there are concerns humans could be more vulnerable. �e�e seeing a bit of a step-change in the spread of this infection, and we shouldn� sit idle because obviously we know what happened with Covid,�aid Brown. He said it was possible to start taking preparatory steps for making a human vaccine for H5N1 but it would be �oolhardy�o make a vaccine now as it was impossible to know what strain might jump into humans, in the unlikely event that did happen.

The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the situation �eeds to be monitored closely�ut the risk to humans remained low. Experts say the virus would probably require more than one or two changes for human-to-human transmission to be a real risk, but the impacts could be huge. There have been nearly 870 cases of bird flu in humans over the past 20 years and 457 were fatal, according to the WHO.

The virus is also devastating wild bird populations across the globe, meaning it is reaching places previously never exposed to such diseases. This means they can carry it to the most pristine parts of the planet, possibly spreading it into other endangered species.

Brown said: � think it is really quite a worry that the virus has already reached so far down into South America. And we have to consider that there are definitely risks for some biodiversity in terms of Antarctica. It really is a concern to think that it can end up in a place like Antarctica.�

Can humans and pets catch bird flu? What to know about the outbreak.,1675987200000,"An outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain is decimating wild and farmed bird populations globally, fueling a debate about the most effective ways to end it and the potential risk to humans.

Some experts are concerned about the possibility that the H5N1 virus could one day evolve to more easily spread from birds to mammals. Although the risk to humans remains low, speculation about the virus has caused worry that the bird flu outbreak could develop into a larger threat.

The Washington Post spoke to a number of experts to answer common questions about bird flu, the risk to humans and pets, and how the outbreak is affecting food prices. Here's what they had to say.

What is bird flu?Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in about 6,000 wild birds and affected more than 58 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since the start of 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""It's been the most serious outbreak for birds that we've had in the U.S. of these highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in recent memory,"" said Nicole Nemeth, an associate professor of pathology and head of the wildlife research and diagnostic service at the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia.

According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm.

How does bird flu affect humans?It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds �hether the birds are dead or alive �r with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces.

Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks �robably from eating infected wild birds �xperts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. In fact, since the start of the current outbreak, only one human case has been reported in the United States.

People who work closely with infected poultry are at an increased risk of becoming infected.

Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis �n eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes �o more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said.

The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain.

A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus �y sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example �o develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University.

""In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia,"" he said, and then ""the fatality rate is very high.""

Human-to-human transmission of the virus is very rare, Schaffner said.

""If that happens, that human being is usually a very close caregiver of the sick person,"" he said.

What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans?Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms �ever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing.

The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the last 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said.

Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat.

How is it treated?People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said.

Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans?Yes. Federal authorities have vaccines against A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) bird flu viruses that could be used if these viruses were to start spreading among the human population, the CDC said.

Can bird flu kill humans?Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare.

According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and 2023, there were 868 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 globally. Of those who were infected, 53 percent �r 457 �ied. Between 2021 and 2022, six confirmed cases of human bird flu infections were reported to the WHO, and two of those infected died.

While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

Could bird flu become the next pandemic?Each time there is highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person.

That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people �a statistical phenomenon,"" Schaffner said.

Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchanged of genetic material is a random event.

""If anything, the odds are against it,"" Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although this strain has infected some mammals �ncluding mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm �that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans,"" he said.

Can dogs and cats catch bird flu?Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said.

Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons.

""If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection,"" Cardona said.

Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs?No. Humans cannot become infected by eating eggs or fully cooked poultry. However, according to the CDC, ""uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia.""

The CDC advises that ""it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States.""

Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry �nd other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry �re typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. ""That's why there's so much death associated, in many ways,"" to the current outbreak, she said. ""It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products. They don't even make it into your pet food.""

What about my backyard chickens?People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said.

Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease.

Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying.

People who have backyard chickens should still take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said.

Has bird flu affected food prices?The outbreak drove up the price of Thanksgiving turkeys in November, but its impact continues to affect egg prices, which is dealing with a number of supply chain issues as well. According to the Agriculture Department, the bird flu has wiped out more than 44 million egg-laying hens, or roughly 4 to 5 percent of production.

Does risk vary by state or country?Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. ""The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable,"" Iqbal said.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world.

Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu?China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have also focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality . But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks. The United Kingdom, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly. Amid the current H5N1 outbreak, some European countries, including France and the Netherlands, are testing the effectiveness of bird vaccination. In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds who may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed.",WaPo,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate of 53% for H5N1 cases.

Why sick minks are reigniting worries about bird flu,1676678400000,"NEW YORK (AP) � recent bird flu outbreak at a mink farm has reignited worries about the virus spreading more broadly to people.

Scientists have been keeping tabs on this bird flu virus since the 1950s, though it wasn't deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong among visitors to live poultry markets.

As bird flu hits more and varied animals, like at the mink farm, the fear is that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic.

Scientist say another kind of bird flu was likely behind the devastating 1918-1919 flu pandemic, and avian viruses played roles in other flu pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009.

Still, the risk to the general public now is low, says Dr. Tim Uyeki of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A look at the bird flu virus and why it is getting renewed attention:

WHAT IS BIRD FLU?

Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but some others chiefly occur in animals. For example, there are flus that occur in dogs, plus pig �r swine �lu viruses. And then there are avian viruses that spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry.

The bird flu virus drawing attention today �ype A H5N1 �as first identified in 1959, by investigators looking into a flu outbreak in chickens in Scotland. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself.

By 2007, the virus was found in more than 60 countries. In the U.S., it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations or backyard flocks in 47 states. Since the beginning of last year, tens of millions of chickens have died of the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading, one of the reasons cited for soaring egg prices.

HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE GET BIRD FLU?

The Hong Kong outbreak in 1997 was the first time this bird flu was blamed for severe human illness. Out of 18 people infected, six died. To contain the outbreak, the Hong Kong government closed live poultry markets, killed all the birds in the markets, and stopped bringing in chickens from southern China. It worked, for a while.

Symptoms are the similar to that of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people don't have noticeable symptoms, but some develop severe. life-threatening pneumonia.

Globally, nearly 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization in 20 countries. But the pace has slowed and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years. In the vast majority of cases, the infected people got it directly from infected birds.

The first and only U.S. case occurred just last April. A prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado, in the western part of the state. His only symptom was fatigue and he recovered.

CAN IT SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE?

In some instances, investigators concluded that the bird flu virus apparently did spread from one person to another. That happened in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, China and Pakistan, most recently in 2007.

In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home. Scientists do not believe it can spread easily through casual contact, as seasonal flu can. But viruses mutate and change. Scientists worry about the ever-increasing number of opportunities for bird flu to mix with other flu viruses in infected people or animals and mutate, making it easier to spread to people.

It wouldn't take much for that to happen ""and then we would be in a really tough situation,�aid Dr. Luis Ostrosky, chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

The CDC's Uyeki said the most worried he's been about H5N1 was during the earlier clusters. That kind of human-to-human spread does not appear to be happening right now, he said.

WHAT HAPPENED AT THE MINK FARM?

Recent concern among public health experts has been fueled, in part, by detection of infections in a variety of mammals. The growing list includes foxes, raccoons, skunks, bears and even marine mammals like seals and porpoises. Officials in Peru said three sea lions found dead in November tested positive for, and the recent deaths of hundreds of others may be due to bird flu.

Then last month, a European medical journal reported on a bird flu outbreak in October at a mink farm in Spain with nearly 52,000 animals, where the illness spread like wildfire.

The mink were fed poultry, and wild birds in the region had been found to have bird flu. But researchers said that however it started, they believe the virus then spread from mink to mink � worrisome scenario. No workers were infected, though they wore masks as part of COVID-19 precautions.

Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, said the outbreak virus is being watched for mutations that could make it more easily transmitted to people, and potentially between people.

""That's the real worry,"" said Nuzzo.

Lateral flow tests being prepared for UK outbreaks of avian flu,1677369600000,"After a girl in Cambodia died from H5N1, the UK Health Security Agency is on alert but says human-to-human transmission is rare

British health officials are preparing plans to deploy lateral flow tests if signs emerge that avian flu has begun to spread from one person to another.

The programme would provide rapid information about the dangers posed by the disease.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is also working on blood tests to detect antibodies against the virus and officials will analyse the disease� genetic mutations to reveal data about the increased risk to human health from avian flu.

The moves follow last week� news that an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia has died from H5N1, the flu strain that is being spread around the globe by migrating birds and is infecting poultry farms.

Investigators are now trying to establish if infected birds were the cause of the Cambodian case, rather than human-to-human transmission.

At present, evidence suggests the H5N1 virus does not pass easily to people although scientists have urged care and caution.

�iruses constantly evolve, and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population,�aid Dr Meera Chand, incident director for avian influenza at the UKHSA.

This point was backed by Professor Ian Brown of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). �here have been over 850 cases in humans across the globe since 1996 with a high case- fatality rate.

�lmost all cases to date have not resulted in human-to-human transmission but vigilance is required.�

Scientists also warned last week that although direct risks of infection were low, people should avoid contact with sick or dead wild birds in public areas such as parks or waterways and should wash their hands after feeding wild birds.

Last week, the UKHSA confirmed it had found avian flu cases in poultry at 145 premises and in 656 wild birds in England, a rise of 15 new premises and 209 detections in wild birds since December 2022.

In addition, 14 out of 134 wild mammals collected since October 2021 were found to have avian flu: four in foxes in England and one in Wales. In Scotland, there were four cases in otters, four in seals and one in a fox.

�his virus keeps cropping up in various mammals and this could increase the possibility of further human infections,�aid Prof Jonathan Ball, of Nottingham University. �he risk to humans is still very low, but it� important that we continue to monitor circulation of flu in both bird and mammal populations.�

The human Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 �hich killed an estimated 50 million people �s believed to have been triggered by a successful transmission of an avian flu virus to humans.

�he initial strain then adapted and became endemic in the human population, giving rise to the seasonal flu viruses,�aid Professor Massimo Palmarini, director of the Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow University.

"As bird flu surges, the nightmare scenario of another pandemic illustrates just how poorly prepared America would be.",1677369600000,"Whatever happened to our Roaring Twenties? In the first year of the pandemic, it was common to hear predictions that however brutal and harrowing the near future seemed, the world would find itself, at some point, celebrating the end of Covid-19 -- perhaps in a grand bacchanal to recall the dizzying decade that followed the Spanish flu of 1918 and 1919, which killed 675,000 Americans.

But that end never really came, not definitively. That the pandemic is no longer seen as an emergency is obvious; just look outside. But the country didn't turn the page so much as limp forward, through a fog of exhaustion and loneliness and long Covid, into the dawn of a new period in which the coronavirus has retreated for most as an everyday threat but may well nevertheless continue as gothic background noise, killing tens of thousands of Americans each year.

A true postpandemic period may still arrive, perhaps even a real Roaring Twenties. But in recent weeks, as researchers have registered one after another mammalian outbreak of the avian influenza H5N1, another possibility has loomed into view, as well: a back-to-back pandemic, potentially driven by a disease that, over the past several decades, has killed about half the humans with known infections.

There have been few cases of human-to-human transmission of bird flu, which is the main reason its incursion into human populations has been so limited. The World Health Organization has said that the risk to humans is low, but also that ''we must prepare for any change in the status quo.'' There are reasons to think that, if the virus did make such an evolutionary jump, it could bring with it a significant reduction in severity. We also don't know exactly how rapidly such a disease would be transmitted among humans, though we have seen some eye-popping mammalian outbreaks over the last year: in minks, most notably, at a Spanish farm; but also in bears, seals, raccoons and foxes, to name just a few of those populations recently infected in the United States. In Peru, roughly 600 sea lions died.

The possibility of a second pandemic raises the obvious question of whether we have learned anything from the last one. Is there any reason to expect that, even with new political leadership, the country's response to a new global outbreak -- of H5N1 or something else altogether -- would be more coherent or more coordinated? To the contrary, contemplating the possibility of a new pandemic in the near future suggests all the ways that America, in its rush to return to normal, failed to do all the things that might have secured a lasting normalcy.

Consider the state of the country's institutional public-health apparatus: Since 2020, there has been no meaningful nationwide disease-surveillance network erected or even planned. (Our patchwork surveillance of avian flu has given us only a crude sense of where it is spreading now among animals.) The F.D.A. is still moving too slowly on some things and too quickly on others. There is no Operation Warp Speed-style funding plan for rapid vaccine development; indeed, the president who can claim credit for it has stopped touting it as one of his achievements.

Billions of dollars in funding for things like air-filtration systems in schools have gone unspent, leaving public buildings no better prepared to endure airborne disease than they were before Covid. There has been little progress to date on lab safety -- which even lab-leak skeptics will acknowledge is an ongoing risk -- and early candidates for more expansive coronavirus vaccines, which could protect against many different pathogens in the same family as SARS-CoV-2, are only in early trials. (Pan-influenza vaccines are moving slowly, too.)

As we now know all too well, pandemic containment isn't just a matter of policy and public investment. It's a complex web of leadership, social trust and public buy-in -- along with a fair amount of chance. But it is hard to believe that the country is now capable of more solidarity and vigilance than it was in early 2020. Vaccine skepticism may not necessarily outlast this pandemic, but the signs are worrying, and there has been precious little policy focus on what can overcome that skepticism. Faith in public-health officials' management of the pandemic has declined, too, and the Biden administration, which was champing at the bit on Inauguration Day, is now offering public-health guidance close to ''you do you'' -- pulling back pandemic response, dumping millions of people off expanded Medicaid coverage and turning the provision of new tests and booster shots to the private market.

There are some encouraging signs when it comes to bird flu: federal discussion of a mass poultry-vaccination program and the ''rapid'' rollout of existing avian-influenza vaccines for humans. But each of these projects could take at least six months, and almost certainly we would find ourselves wasting the early stage of a new pandemic -- and possibly more than that -- relitigating debates over the last one. You can see the fault lines already, with those who believe the country's Covid response went too far taking to social media to mock the suggestion that any of the same measures -- social distancing, masking, school closures -- might be implemented to hold off a new contagion, as though it were irrelevant that this new one might be many times deadlier.

Over time, fatality rates considerably higher than those encountered with Covid would (one hopes) shake a lot of the country's current mitigation fatalism -- because a disease that kills 5 percent of those infected looks very different from one that kills only 1 percent. But a deadlier pandemic would probably also, perversely, reignite arguments over our response to SARS-CoV-2, because such a fatality rate would make that disease look relatively mild -- and the global response to it much more significant -- by comparison. Beginning in 2020, Covid minimizers compared it to the flu, which kills a fraction as many (and tends to infect many fewer). If, in the next pandemic, fatality rates were five times higher, would minimizers dismiss it similarly -- ''It's just Covid''? Already, we've normalized quite a lot more dying than almost any American thought possible in early 2020, when the country bunkered down in response to warnings that the disease could kill 100,000 to 200,000 people. Normalization isn't just a matter of the vaccine skeptics in your timeline. On the campaign trail, Joe Biden declared that any president responsible for 220,000 American deaths should not remain president; he has now presided over 700,000.

In 2020, we were panicked; now we're exhausted. In 2021, many doctors left the profession, and those still working are often reporting burnout. As many as half of nurses have reported in surveys that they are considering leaving the profession, as is one in five doctors. Even in the ''post-emergency'' phase of the pandemic, national hospital capacity is under strain, and rural hospitals are closing at a distressing rate.

This is not to say that, in facing any potential new pandemic, failure is inevitable. But even a limited outbreak, successfully contained through mitigation or outraced through rapid vaccine production, would still represent a grim premonition -- an unmistakable signal to many that the world has now entered what epidemiologists have been memorably calling the Pandemicine. That is, a new epoch, defined as much by the increasing frequency of viral spillover events as the Anthropocene has been defined by the human influence on the planet.

When we give our era names like these, it makes the disjunctures seem inevitable, almost preordained. But human fallout from new disease is no more inevitable than from carbon emissions. Here, the cost of accumulated indifference could be similarly high, and not just in the obvious human toll. In welcoming eight billion of us unmistakably to a new pandemic age, a back-to-back outbreak would cast a sort of permanent viral shadow on the decades to come -- a legacy less like the Roaring Twenties than the Great Depression.

Vaccine Makers Are Preparing for Bird Flu,1677715200000,"Minks in Spain, seals in Scotland, sea lions and dolphins in South America: a number of mammal species have recently been found to be infected with H5N1, a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza. Avian flu is not new; epidemiologists have been studying it for decades. But the detection of the virus in mammals has many concerned about the potential that it could spill over to humans and cause a larger outbreak.

As the world enters the fourth year of a global pandemic caused by a virus that likely came from an animal, concern over another virus potentially uprooting our lives is valid. H5N1 has infected humans before, although human-to-human transmission has rarely been observed. And while the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the mortality rate of avian flu in humans is around 56 percent, many experts believe it� likely to be much lower if the virus becomes more transmissible. One reason avian flu is so lethal is that it infects the lower respiratory tract, which can lead to respiratory failure. If it were to mutate to infect the upper respiratory tract and spread more easily, it would probably cause milder illness. Yet even a virus that causes mild or moderate illness in many people can have a serious toll, as we�e seen with the COVID pandemic. So efforts are underway to develop vaccines to protect against such a form of bird flu.

Bird flu has spilled over to humans before�n fact, just last week a girl in Cambodia died from H5N1 (although not the same strain as the one that is sickening birds worldwide).

""Each time we see this happen, we get these spurts of cases, [and] people say, �ere it comes; it� going to happen,� says Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota� Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. But he stressed that H5N1 is likely not an imminent threat to humans.

Others agree. �� keeping a close eye on it as an expert, but as a member of the community, as a parent and someone who [has been] recently experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, I� not worried about this right now,�ays Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. �his is an animal health issue right now that has a theoretical risk to become a human health issue.�

Avian influenza viruses infect birds by attaching to a receptor in their respiratory tract. In order for the virus to become a human virus and start circulating from person to person in the population, it would have to be able to attach itself to the human version of this receptor�omething it hasn� yet evolved to do.

�t� a really dangerous time to be a bird,�ndrew Pavia, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah, adds. �ut as of today, the risk to humans remains very low. Our concern is what� going to happen as it circulates more and more.�

It� unfortunately nearly impossible to predict when this jump could happen. �one of us know when the next influenza pandemic will emerge. It could be tomorrow [or] it could be years from now, and we don� know which of the viruses will become the next pandemic virus,�sterholm says. �t the outset, you have to say there is uncertainty, with one exception: there will be a pandemic.�

The U.S. is somewhat equipped to handle avian flu: there is a stockpile of egg-based flu vaccines for the H5N1 strain. Eggs are one of the most common ways to make a flu vaccine. To create it, manufacturers inject an inactivated or weakened virus into a fertilized chicken egg, incubate the egg for a few days while the virus multiplies and then harvest the virus to use for the vaccine. The country has a secret chicken stockpile in undisclosed locations across the U.S. just in case we need to make egg-based vaccines quickly�uch as during a flu pandemic. It may be concerning that this vaccine strategy depends on an animal that is highly susceptible to the flu in question. But several experts told Scientific American that there are high levels of biosecurity at the chicken facilities in order to avoid bird flu contamination.

Alternatives to egg-based vaccines exist. Since the early 2010s, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been partnering with CSL Seqirus, one of the largest influenza vaccine manufacturers, to develop vaccines grown in cells in a laboratory. The pandemic preparedness vaccine AUDENZ, which targets the H5N1 subtype specifically, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And although it� impossible to determine which virus will cause the next pandemic, CSL Seqirus has a library of viruses that have the potential to infect humans. And the company is constantly looking for candidate vaccine viruses that it can tailor to a specific pathogen.

�e use data [for] one of the avian strains to create a mock-up file,�ays Marc Lacey, who runs CSL Seqirus� pandemic preparedness and response team. The team members basically identify certain viruses, use them to create vaccines and conduct some of the early safety studies so that if an avian flu strain evolves into a true pandemic strain transmitting between humans, they will be ready to go with an adequate vaccine. Lacey says that his company would be able to supply the U.S. government with 150 million doses within the first six months of a pandemic being declared, but he thinks the scale-up potential could be higher, especially if multiple manufacturers could help produce it. Because there are eight billion people in the world, scale-up and widespread collaboration across countries would be necessary to make enough vaccine.

There are also efforts to apply messenger RNA (mRNA) technology�uch as that used for some of the COVID vaccines�o flu vaccines. According to University of Washington microbiologist Deborah Fuller, these efforts range from developing a universal flu vaccine to creating a �ultivalent�accine that targets only a few subtypes�r versions of the virus (like a typical seasonal flu vaccine does). One advantage of mRNA technology is its speed of production. And because of the COVID pandemic, there is now more infrastructure to mass-produce doses. �NA vaccines can be designed extremely quickly�ou only need the genetic sequence of what the new variant is that� emerging, and within weeks, [you] can have a vaccine already tested in animal models,�uller says.

Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, is also investigating mRNA flu vaccines. He� part of a research team developing a 20-subtype mRNA flu vaccine that includes an H5N1 strain (although not the one currently circulating in birds). The team recently published its findings in Science. Hensley� lab is now developing a single-strain vaccine tailored to the current bird flu strain�nd is already testing it in laboratory animals. He emphasizes that, as with the COVID vaccines, his vaccines are meant to prevent serious illness and death, not infection.

But even the 20-subtype vaccine is expected to provide some protection against the new strain. �hen we developed [that] vaccine, the idea was to create one that could induce a certain level of immune memory against every subtype,�ensley says. �ur goal wasn� to predict which influenza subtype would cause the next pandemic or which strain would cause it. Rather the vaccine [would induce] some level of immune memory against every subtype so that it would limit disease and death caused by new pandemic strains.�

A vaccine is only part of pandemic preparedness�ou also need effective treatments. As Pavia says, researchers aren� working from scratch trying to create something like the COVID antiviral Paxlovid, which took nearly two years to get to market. FDA-approved antivirals for influenza, such as Tamiflu, already exist and will be important for reducing deaths during a flu pandemic. Pavia is also hopeful that the U.S. could quickly adapt diagnostic tests to match an outbreak strain of pandemic flu.

�e have better tools and better knowledge about influenza than we did about coronaviruses. In many ways, we would be a step ahead,�avia says. �ut what I worry about is our political capacity to respond. We need to continue to [increase] awareness and continue preparation efforts. And if things start to accelerate, we need a concerted, nonpoliticized effort to move quickly and effectively.�",SciAm,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate of 56% for avian flu according to WHO.

"US focuses on limiting spread amid record bird flu season, but vaccines could be a possibility in the",1678406400000,"The Biden administration is monitoring what experts say is the deadliest outbreak of bird flu that the US has ever
seen, and officials are considering a ""range of options"" on how to respond.
The outbreak is not currently considered a serious threat to human health, according to the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
Globally, there have only been a handful of cases of avian flu in humans, mostly in people who had direct contact
with infected birds or with surfaces contaminated with their excretions. There was one human case last year in
the United States, a Colorado man who got sick after culling infected birds. He was isolated and treated with an
antiviral.
More than 860 total cases of bird flu have been reported among humans in 19 countries since 2003, and more
than half of those cases were fatal, according to the CDC.
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesussaid in February that the risk to
humans still remains low. But given the large number of infected birds, he added, ""we cannot assume that will
remain the case.""
There have been 6,356 cases in wild birds in all 50 states, according to the CDC, but there are probably many
more. In 47 states, there have been multiple outbreaks among poultry, involving more than 58.6 million birds. It
has also shown up in noncommercial backyard flocks, according to the US Department of Agriculture.
The disease has shown up in other animals in the US, too, including bears, foxes, raccoon, possums, mountain
lions, bobcats and even a bottlenose dolphin. As the virus moves through mammals, chances go up that it could
mutate and spread more easily among humans.
The CDC is able to watch for the virus in communities through the labs it uses to monitor more typical flu viruses.
The agency also told CNN that it is also exploring whether manufacturers might want to make commercial tests
for these viruses more broadly available.
The Biden administration said it has also been watching the situation carefully.
""As a part of the administration's focus on addressing any infectious disease with urgency and preparedness, we
continue to monitor the avian flu outbreak. There are a range of options the United States regularly considers
when there is any outbreak that could affect the security and safety of the United States' food supply,"" a National
Security Council official told CNN.
""Right now, we are focused on promoting and enhancing high-impact biosafety practices and procedures.""
Biosafety procedures typically include enhanced disinfection practices for people who work with birds. In
November, the CDC recommended that people who interact with birds that look sick -- even in backyard flocks --
should wear disposable gloves, boots, eye protection and an N95 respirator or a face mask.
""CDC continues to take any threat of infectious disease seriously and assesses the avian flu's current risk to
humans as very low. The Department of Agriculture continues to respond quickly whenever the virus is detected
among bird populations,"" the National Security Council official said.
The CDC says the risk assessment tool that it uses to understand a virus' potential as a pandemic risk
determined that if these H5N1 viruses were to mutate into a version that could spread easily and efficiently in
people, the pandemic risk is ""moderate,"" and the public health impact of such an event also would be of moderate
severity.
""This is why it's so important that both the public health and animal health side take precautions to limit exposures
among animal species and between animals and people, and thus limit the chances that some type of virus
reassortment event that may allow these viruses to infect people easily and spread easily between people,"" the
agency said in an email to CNN.
General precautions include containing animal outbreaks and limiting exposure for the public. That includes
avoiding close contact with sick birds, cooking poultry fully and not eating raw eggs.
Another precaution is to take steps toward a vaccine, just in case, and there are efforts under way.
Exploring vaccines for humans and animals
Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, and colleagues have been working
on a vaccine candidate that could be used in humans if the virus started circulating among people.
""We think that the vaccine will elicit very high levels of neutralizing antibodies against this specific strain because
it's basically perfectly matched to what's circulating now,"" Hensley said.
The vaccine seems to work well in the lab, he said, and the researchers plan to test it on chickens this spring.
The CDC says it recently produced a candidate vaccine virus, an influenza virus that manufacturers can use to
make a vaccine, that is nearly identical to a viral protein detected in birds and mammals. It could be used to
produce a vaccine for people ""if needed.""
""Such a vaccine would be expected to provide good protections against circulating H5N1 viruses,"" the CDC said.
The agency said it has shared this with vaccine manufacturers.
For years, the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, a division of the US Department of Agriculture, has also
been working on a vaccine for potential emergency use in animals. There may be an advantage to vaccinating
poultry to reduce the chances that the virus could mutate.
Vaccinating poultry against avian flu, is ""not something that's really done in our country, but I think it's time to think
about that for sure,"" Hensley said.
Farm animals, including birds, are already vaccinated for other diseases. Chickens, for example, routinely get
vaccinated for Marek's disease, which caused by a herpesvirus. They're also vaccinated against Newcastle
disease, a respiratory illness; infectious bronchitis; and acute necrotic proventriculitis, a viral disease that affects
the immune system.
Avian flu may someday be included in that list, according to a spokesperson for the USDA.
""In the interest of leaving no stone unturned in the fight against (highly pathogenic avian flu), USDA continues to
research vaccine options that can protect poultry from this persistent threat,"" the spokesperson told CNN.
Vaccination, though, is not the first option.
""From vaccine development to production timelines to dissemination to flocks, there are many factors that make
implementing a vaccine strategy a challenge, and it would take time to deliver an effective vaccine,"" the USDA
said.
So first and foremost, ""we are pursuing collaborative efforts with poultry farmers and companies on education,
training, and implementation of comprehensive biosecurity measures. Biosecurity is the best and most prudent
approach we have to mitigate the impact of the disease today.""

Lab-created bird flu virus accident shows lax oversight of risky 'gain of function' research,1681171200000,"This exclusive article is adapted from former USA TODAY investigative reporter Alison Young� forthcoming book ""Pandora� Gamble: Lab Leaks, Pandemics, and a World at Risk,"" which will be released April 25. In this excerpt, Young reveals for the first time details of a December 2019 lab safety breach involving one of the world� most infamous lab-created �ain of function�iruses �nd the efforts that were made to downplay the event, avoid notifying health authorities and oversight bodies, and keep the public and policymakers in the dark.

Inside the high-security Influenza Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, two experienced scientists were pulling ferrets out of their HEPA-filtered cages on a Monday in December 2019. Another researcher, still in training, was also in the room to watch and learn.

One by one, the animals were put into a biosafety cabinet, where a solution was washed into their nostrils. It� a procedure used to collect evidence of infection, and this particular experiment involved exposing the animals to a highly controversial lab-engineered strain of H5N1 avian influenza virus.

The virus they were working with that day was far from ordinary, and there should have been no room for the safety breach that was about to happen and the oversight failures that followed.

The experiment underway involved one of two infamous lab-made bird flu viruses that had alarmed scientists around the world when their creation became widely known nearly a decade earlier. In each case, scientists had taken an avian influenza virus that was mostly dangerous to birds and manipulated it in ways that potentially increased its threat to humans.

In nature, the H5N1 virus has rarely infected humans. But when people have been sickened, usually through close contact with infected birds, more than half died. So it is fortunate that the H5N1 virus isn� capable of spreading easily from person to person. If the virus were ever to evolve in ways that gave it that ability, it could cause a devastating pandemic.

'Gain of function' research created controversial flu viruses

And yet in late 2011 the world learned that two scientific teams �ne in Wisconsin, led by virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka, and another in the Netherlands, led by virologist Ron Fouchier �ad potentially pushed the virus in that direction. Each of these labs had created H5N1 viruses that had gained the ability to spread through the air between ferrets, the animal model used to study how flu viruses might behave in humans.

The ultimate goal of this work was to help protect the world from future pandemics, and the research was supported with words and funding by two of the most prominent scientists in the United States: Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH� National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Kawaoka contended it would be �rresponsible not to study�ow the virus might evolve in nature. �ome people have argued that the risks of such studies �isuse and accidental release, for example �utweigh the benefits. I counter that H5N1 viruses circulating in nature already pose a threat,�e said at the time.

Yet these groundbreaking scientific feats set off a heated international debate over the ethics and safety of �ain of function�esearch. The controversy continues to this day.

Concerns about the safety of biological research have taken on heightened urgency in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and growing acceptance of the possibility that it was caused by a lab accident in China. In February, it was revealed that analysts at the U.S. Department of Energy had joined the FBI in leaning toward a lab accident as the most likely source of the pandemic, though other U.S. intelligence agencies lean toward a natural origin or are undecided.

Where's the apology?: COVID may have leaked out of a Chinese lab after all. So much for 'misinformation.'

Former U.S. surgeon general: We'll never know the full truth about COVID-19 origins. Political infighting won't help.

The story of how the H5N1 viruses came to be created �nd how the University of Wisconsin and the Kawaoka lab would later respond to the 2019 safety breach during the ferret experiment �aises uncomfortable questions about the tremendous trust the world places in these kinds of labs.

We are trusting that every hour of every day their layers of laboratory containment equipment are working properly, that all of their employees are sufficiently trained, qualified and attentive, and that their written safety and incident response protocols are followed in real-life practice.

When something goes wrong, we are trusting that the labs will immediately notify local public health officials who are responsible for preventing outbreaks and the federal authorities who oversee the safety of experiments with genetically engineered organisms.

Given that so much about this work is shrouded in secrecy, what happened in Wisconsin raises the question: Should the public give this trust blindly?

'Miscommunication' over quarantine alarmed NIH a decade ago

In 2013, six years before the 2019 safety incident with the ferret experiment at Kawaoka� lab in Wisconsin, another member of his research team accidentally pierced their finger with a needle that had an engineered H5N1 virus on it.

It was a moment of poor judgment, human error around 6:30 p.m. Nov. 16, 2013, that set off a series of emergency calls that would eventually raise concerns in the nation� capital.

An expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told officials at Wisconsin� state health department that while the likelihood the scientist would develop symptoms of H5N1 was �ow,�he needlestick �hould be considered a serious exposure�nd treated aggressively. The chief medical officer at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services told the university that the researcher would need to quarantine for seven days and take a treatment-level dose of Tamiflu twice a day for 10 days.

Six months earlier, while seeking funding and approval for the controversial experiments, Kawaoka had assured officials at the National Institutes of Health that the university had a designated quarantine apartment.

But it turned out that wasn� the case.

So lab officials told the researcher� family to pack up their belongings and go to a hotel. And the injured researcher was sent to quarantine at home.

Officials in the NIH office responsible for overseeing research with engineered organisms were alarmed to learn that the university didn� have a dedicated quarantine facility for such emergencies.

�his policy is not what was communicated to us in Dr. Kawaoka� application to perform research with mammalian transmissible strains of H5N1,�rote Dr. Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, acting director of the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, in a letter to the university.

A researcher� home, the NIH told the university, was not an appropriate quarantine site for Kawaoka� high-risk studies because influenza viruses can be transmissible through the air, and many residences are in high-occupancy buildings, like apartments, that share air exchange and other infrastructure.

Trying to provide an explanation, university officials told NIH there had been a �iscommunication�etween Kawaoka and the university� administration. Wisconsin officials noted that the needlestick was not expected to put the researcher at high risk of infection, and that this engineered virus �as determined not to be a mammalian-transmissible strain.�

The scientist with the needlestick completed quarantine without showing symptoms or becoming ill.

But even if a high-risk incident occurred with a more dangerous strain, UW officials told the NIH, the lab worker would still be quarantined at home.

Could an accident have caused COVID-19?: Why the Wuhan lab-leak theory shouldn't be dismissed

'I remember it very well': Dr. Fauci describes a secret 2020 meeting to talk about COVID origins

It was a stunning change by the university to a critical safeguard that federal officials thought was in place for the Kawaoka lab� research. The NIH demanded the university find a dedicated quarantine facility outside of workers�esidences, such as a hospital isolation room, or face the suspension or termination of its grant funding, correspondence shows.

The university didn� want to use the UW Hospital as a quarantine site.

Their concerns included that researchers might be unwilling to come forward about potential exposures if they faced being confined in hospital isolation rooms. The university and its medical team also worried about the increased potential for the public to learn about its lab accidents, noting in correspondence that �t would be much harder to control the spread of information and as a result there would be a higher probability of incorrect information being told to (the) general public and potentially members of the media.�

The university eventually agreed to NIH� demands. And on Dec. 24, 2013, the NIH gave its approval for Kawaoka� lab to resume its research manipulating H5N1 virus strains that were transmissible to mammals.

Safety concerns led to US pause on 'gain of function' studies

By 2014, there was a growing discomfort at the highest levels of the U.S. government about the risk of an accident with an engineered virus.

Wisconsin� needlestick incident, which drew questions within NIH but wasn� publicly known, was soon followed by a series of high-profile accidents at federal labs in 2014 �rom safety breaches with anthrax and avian influenza at the CDC to the discovery of forgotten vials of smallpox that had been kept for decades in a storage room on the NIH Existing text... campus.

In October 2014, citing these federal lab incidents, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced a moratorium on new federal funding for certain gain-of-function research while the risks and benefits of the controversial experiments were studied.

The funding pause remained in place for three years until it was finally lifted in December 2017. But it was only in 2019 that some of the halted experiments were quietly allowed to begin again under a revised federal oversight process, which was criticized for keeping secret the details of the new experiments and the basis for the government approvals.

The Kawaoka lab was one of the first to receive approval and NIH funding.

Not long after the Kawaoka lab was greenlighted in 2019 to resume work with its infamous lab-created H5N1 influenza virus �he one that had helped spark the worldwide debate over gain-of-function research �here was an accident.

And in the days and weeks that followed, efforts were made to downplay the significance of the event, avoid notifying public health officials and oversight bodies, and keep the public and policymakers in the dark.

A lot was at stake.

Not only would the incident draw attention to safety issues at the UW lab, but it also would raise larger questions about the rigor and effectiveness of how the U.S. government was overseeing the riskiest experiments in which scientists are creating enhanced pathogens with pandemic potential.

Scientist's air hose detached in lab while working with engineered virus

When the accident happened on Dec. 9, 2019, Kawaoka� three scientists were working in an enhanced biosafety level 3 agriculture lab suite at the University of Wisconsin� Influenza Research Institute.

This facility had been built specifically for Kawaoka� research and featured labs with negative air pressure, watertight and airtight seals, double HEPA-filtered exhaust air and redundant air handling systems.

The experiment they were performing involved a virus whose name describes the components of its engineering: VN1203HA(N158D/N224K/ Q226L/T318I)/CA04. It was the virus described in Kawaoka� controversial H5N1 gain-of-function experiments that had been published nearly eight years earlier, the NIH would later confirm in written responses to my questions.

It was the virus that had gained the concerning ability to spread between ferrets and had raised fears it could do this among humans.

On that December day, two experienced researchers from Kawaoka� team were helping train a colleague as they collected samples from ferrets. The animals were part of a transmission experiment and had been in contact with other ferrets infected with this engineered H5N1 virus or another wild-type flu strain.

The three scientists wore several layers of personal protection equipment. One of their most important pieces of personal protective equipment was the air-purifying respirator that each wore to ensure they didn� breathe any air from inside the laboratory. Even though they were using a biosafety cabinet, there was always the potential for virus to be present in the room� air.

These kinds of high-tech respirators encase workers�eads in a protective hood with a clear face-plate. A blower attached to a belt delivers purified air through what looks like a vacuum cleaner hose that runs up the scientist� back and attaches to the hood behind their head.

Labs are responsible for training workers how to properly assemble and use this kind of equipment.

As one of the senior researchers prepared to start collecting samples from the next round of ferrets, the trainee realized there was a problem with their respirator.

The powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) hose had somehow disconnected from the unit that supplied safe, filtered air. Instead, the detached hose dangled loose in the lab� potentially contaminated air.

The hose was �mmediately�econnected, Wisconsin officials later said, and one of the experienced researchers radioed out to the lab� operations manager as the trainee began the process of exiting the lab, incident records show.

The trainee was initially told to follow the lab� quarantine procedure to keep them spreading the virus if they were infected. The university would later say this was done �ut of an abundance of caution.�ut at some point, a lab compliance official released the worker from quarantine.

It is unclear whether this quarantine release happened within minutes, hours or days of the incident. Nor is it clear whether university officials first consulted with any public health and oversight agencies.

Kawaoka and university officials wouldn� agree to be interviewed and provided little information in response to my questions.

State and local health officials weren't notified about lab accident

If there were ever a virus requiring that everyone follow safety and incident reporting rules, this was it. The system of oversight in place that day had been created in response to the international furor over this very virus.

Yet, after the trainee� respirator hose disconnected in December 2019, the university didn� notify local or state public health officials about the incident or consult with them before discontinuing the trainee� quarantine, despite representations going back years indicating this would occur following �ny potential exposure.�

The university says it didn� need to notify them. That� because UW officials, in consultation with the university� health experts, made their own determination that no potential exposure had occurred.

Officials at Public Health Madison & Dane County, the local health department, told me they defer to the university� judgment and expertise when it comes to lab safety issues. The department said it �oes not need to be notified of something that was determined to not be a significant exposure. It is also not incumbent on us to further evaluate whether there was a significant exposure, if UW reports that there was not.�

The university also didn� immediately alert other key oversight entities that the public relies upon to ensure the safety of this kind of particularly risky research.

UW officials waited two months �ntil Feb. 10, 2020 �o file a report that should have been made immediately to the NIH Office of Science Policy, which oversees U.S. research with genetically manipulated organisms like the engineered H5N1 influenza virus involved in the experiment.

Records show the university� internal biosafety committee, which had approved the Kawaoka lab� research, wasn� �pprised�f the Dec. 9, 2019, incident until Feb. 5, 2020.

The university was less slow in reporting the incident to the federal funding officials at NIH� National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which provided the grant for the controversial experiments. But UW still waited 10 days �ntil Dec. 19, 2019 �o report the incident to NIAID program staff, according to information provided to me in writing by NIH officials.

The grant� terms required immediate notification in the event of an �llness or exposure.�t was UW� contention, however, that �either of the two criteria were met�ecause there was �o reasonable risk of virus exposure,�IH officials told me. When the university eventually notified grant officials, it said it was doing so �n the spirit of transparency and responsible conduct of research,�he NIH said.

UW officials, who for months wouldn� answer many of my questions about the incident, eventually said that Kawaoka �nformed his program officer at NIH in early December,�efore following up with an incident summary on Dec. 19.

As I pressed NIH to reconcile the agency� statement with UW� account, a few more details emerged. NIH said that the first time UW contacted anyone at the agency was on Dec. 12, 2019 �hree days after the incident. That� when UW first requested a phone call from an NIAID program officer. A first discussion about the incident happened on Dec. 13, and on Dec. 16, during a follow-up discussion, NIAID staff asked UW to send in a written description of the incident.

Both NIAID Director Anthony Fauci and NIAID Principal Deputy Director Hugh Auchincloss �ere briefed about the incident,�he NIH said in a written response to my questions. But NIH would not tell me when Fauci and Auchincloss were briefed or whether they provided guidance on how the UW incident should be handled.

UW officials said Kawaoka� lab immediately reported the incident to the CDC� select agent lab regulators. But the university didn� answer my questions about why the incident was immediately reported to the CDC �nd not NIH �iven UW� stated position that there wasn� any potential exposure.

It is unclear whether Kawaoka� team consulted the CDC in advance of the university� decision to release the researcher from quarantine. CDC officials �ncluding Dr. Samuel Edwin, who heads the select agent program �idn� answer my questions about this.

University notified federal oversight team 2 months after lab accident

When the university finally notified the NIH Office of Science Policy about the ferret incident �wo months after it happened �W officials unsuccessfully tried to justify their significant delay by saying the incident was �ot reportable �ecause even though the trainee� PAPR tube had detached, in their view there was �o potential exposure.�

The university� justifications, records show, included that the ferrets had been handled inside a biosafety cabinet and that the contact ferrets had been exposed to infected ferrets for only about 24 hours �nd were not shedding virus yet.�

The university also told NIH officials that �he air the observer would have breathed during the few seconds the hose was disconnected would have come from inside the PAPR hood, which would have been HEPA- filtered before the hose disconnected.�

The lab� report to the NIH doesn� say how they determined this.

The reason UW finally told the NIH oversight office about the incident was because lab regulators at the Federal Select Agent Program �s well as the NIH office that funded the research ��ecommended�t be reported.

The report UW finally submitted to the NIH Office of Science Policy includes the following notation: �Confidential �o not release this information without written authorization of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.�

What were the consequences of UW� delayed reporting of the incident? The NIH Office of Science Policy told me it �eminded the institution about its reporting responsibilities,�nd �oted that it should have been immediately reported to OSP.�

If NIH delivered that message, UW officials say they never heard it. �his is certainly the kind of information we would have remembered or recorded in notes taken at the time,� UW spokesperson said by email.

UW repeatedly pointed to a short email from an NIH analyst thanking the university for its Feb. 10, 2020, report and adding that �he actions taken in response to this incident appear appropriate.�IH says this email referred only to UW� �iosafety actions,�ot to the university� failure to file an immediate report.

In the end, the trainee apparently didn� become infected. But how the university and the lab oversight system handled the incident should be cause for concern.

�t is all too easy to sensationalize this research, to misconstrue events, and misrepresent the nature of incidents rightfully reported by institutions to regulatory agencies,�aid Kelly Tyrrell, UW� director of media relations, in a email that spoke in broad brushstrokes about the importance of research, the humanity of researchers, and how sometimes there can be differences in interpretations of incident reporting requirements and about regulations.

Tyrrell said that UW takes safety seriously, and that the Kawaoka lab has never had an incident where public health or safety have been put at risk.

�here are few people in the world trained to understand the nature of the pathogens involved, the biosafety and biosecurity measures in place and the protocols developed and followed,�yrrell continued. �ost people are also not equipped to appropriately evaluate the risk. It is unfortunate that some seek to capitalize on this knowledge gap.�

"Bird flu : Scientists find mutations, say threat is still low",1681430400000,"NEW YORK (AP) � man in Chile is infected with a bird flu that has concerning mutations, but the threat to people from the virus remains low, U.S. health officials said Friday.

Past animal studies suggest these mutations could cause the virus to be more harmful or spread more easily, health officials said. But they also said there is no evidence that the mutations would make it easier for it to take root in a person� upper lungs � development that would raise concerns about spread among people.

The mutations do not change public health officials�ssessment of the overall risk to people from the H5N1 virus, which ""continues to be low,�aid Vivien Dugan of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The mutations, which have appeared only in the one hospitalized patient, may have occurred after the man got sick, CDC officials said. There� no evidence that the mutated virus spread to other people, mixed with other flu viruses, or developed the ability to fight off current medicines or evade vaccines, agency officials said.

Such genetic changes have been seen in past bird flu infections.

�evertheless, it� important to continue to look carefully at every instance of human infection,"" Dugan said. ""We need to remain vigilant for changes that would make these viruses more dangerous to people.�

This type of flu, called Type A H5N1, was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, when visitors to live poultry markets caught it.

Sporadic outbreaks have followed, and more than 450 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of infected people got it directly from birds.

As bird flu hits other species, however, scientists fear the virus could evolve to spread more easily among people. And it has been spreading widely, to birds and animals in scores of countries.

In the U.S., it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks across the country. Since the beginning of last year, tens of millions of chickens have died of the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading, one of the reasons cited for soaring U.S. egg prices.

The new lab analysis looked at the virus found in the lungs of a 53-year-old man living in Chile� Antofagasta region. It may be that he became infected through contact with sick or dead birds or infected sea lions, according to a WHO summary of the case.

The man was healthy and had not traveled recently. On March 13, he started getting a cough, sore throat and hoarseness, the WHO said.

His symptoms worsened and he eventually was sent to an intensive care unit and treated with antiviral medicines and antibiotics. He is still hospitalized and being monitored, CDC officials said.

Genetic sequencing this week revealed the two concerning mutations. Chilean and American health officials have been working together on the investigation.

Andrew Pekosz, a flu researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said he hasn't seen the preliminary analysis of the Chilean patient's infection.

�hen these viruses get into humans, there's a likelihood that they start to adapt to grow better in us,�nd this is a sign that is happening, he said.

There are three or four kinds of mutations that would need to be seen in a H5N1 virus �efore that would really raise the alarm signal that something is happening of concern,�e added.

Biden administration is testing four vaccines in hopes of fighting avian flu,1683072000000,"Agriculture officials in the Biden administration are testing four vaccines in hopes of stanching the latest outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza that has devastated U.S. poultry farms and driven up egg prices, with plans to launch a national vaccination campaign that would be the first-ever effort of its kind.

Two of the vaccines being tested by the U.S. Department of Agriculture were developed by that agency. The others, from animal drugmaker Zoetis and Merck Animal Health, were developed during the last large-scale outbreak in 2015 and not used, a USDA spokesman said.

Should the trials be successful, the next stage is identifying manufacturers, with many more steps before laying hens, domesticated turkeys and broilers are vaccinated. In a best-case scenario, the agency estimates an 18- to 24-month timeline before having a commercial quantity of vaccine available that matches the currently circulating virus strain, but the timeline could be expedited in an emergency.

Although there is little concern that the virus, known as H5N1 avian flu, could spark a human pandemic, it has become a major headache for the world's poultry farmers. This has been the largest and most deadly outbreak ever. Nearly 60 million farm-raised birds in the United States have died or been killed to stop the virus's spread.

The virus has also contributed to sky-high egg prices. But while ""eggflation"" has calmed temporarily, bird flu has not flown the coop.

Historically, avian flu outbreaks have come and gone. The virus went undetected in the United States for several years but reemerged in 2022 and has been present in North America ever since. But what is often a seasonal problem, peaking in spring and summer months with the movement of wild migratory birds, now seems not to be going away.

Experts say there are indications that the current aggressive strain may have become permanent in North America, part of a new normal to which the poultry industry must adapt.

""The virus really spread from the Atlantic Coast westward across the U.S. and is now being detected in all 50 states, including Alaska,"" Nichola Hill, a professor in the biology department at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, said in a briefing last week. ""So, we've seen continuous circulation in North America since that time, and it's raised the question of whether this virus is now endemic.""

Despite efforts to contain the virus, it has continued to spread among bird species and recently jumped to mammals. There have been no documented cases of human-to-human transmission, and people known to have been sickened worked closely with poultry. But it poses dangers for pets and means more uncertainty ahead for the cost of eggs.

Egg prices fell by almost 11 percent last month, according to government data. Seth Meyer, chief economist for the USDA, optimistically predicted in February that wholesale egg prices would fall even further and total egg production would increase this year. But this prediction assumes there will not be continued avian flu outbreaks. And this, say many veterinarians and poultry experts, is wishful thinking.

Egg prices overall had been trending upward in the United States since the current strain of avian flu struck, increasing by 155 percent between the beginning of 2022 and the start of this year. Eggs became the go-to example as food prices rose more broadly, surging to $4.25 per dozen in December, which put pressure on Americans' pocketbooks and drove up the costs of foods that contained eggs. Some people frustrated with the spiraling prices went so far as to decorate potatoes this Easter. (The Potatoes USA promotion board nudged that idea along.)

Analysts at Rabobank, a financial services provider, predict egg prices will remain elevated globally, with even higher prices in countries where strong avian flu pressures persist. Persistently high prices and scarcity could pose a particular challenge for low-income consumers because eggs are an important staple food, high in protein and nutrients.

More than 254 million birds have died of it or been depopulated worldwide, said David Swayne, a poultry veterinarian who specializes in avian flu, on a recent call with reporters.

It is now considered a ""panzootic,"" meaning a pandemic in wild animals: Last month, 3,500 sea lions succumbed to it in Peru, according to Peru's national parks service. Scientists have detected the virus in more than 100 species of wild birds, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have documented infections in bears, foxes, skunks, farmed mink and zoo animals such as tigers and leopards. Earlier this month, avian flu was linked to the deaths of three pet cats in Nebraska.

""This happens when our pets are predating on dead birds,"" Hill said. ""We knew that this moment would arrive when pets would be affected. If you're walking a dog, keep it on a leash to keep it away from wildlife, and keep cats indoors.""

Hill said the transmission to mammals may be happening via waterborne transmission, meaning mammals such as whales and seals are getting it from a virus in the water, which can lead to mass mortality events. Or transmission is happening when animals such as foxes feed on dead, infected birds such as ducks.

The USDA said its Agricultural Research Service began avian influenza vaccination trials in April. They expect data on the efficacy of a single-dose vaccine in May and the results of a two-dose vaccine challenge in June.

Widespread vaccination could be expensive and logistically complicated, said Yuko Sato, a veterinary professor at Iowa State University. As with the coronavirus, it's a virus that keeps changing, so a vaccine that worked on an earlier version of the virus might not do the job long-term.

""You'd want to give one shot and then a second shot two weeks later, but there are 300 million laying hens,"" said Sato, adding that there are also 9.6 billion broilers raised for the meat industry. An effort of that magnitude would have significant costs that would be passed on to consumers' grocery bills. Also, Sato said, once birds are vaccinated, they may not show symptoms of the virus even when infected, so it might make detection much harder.

""Vaccines are not a silver bullet and won't prevent infection,"" she said.

Because of this, some experts worry that widespread vaccination could hurt poultry exports, making it harder for chicken farmers to prove to trading partners that animals are free from disease. (In the last big bird flu outbreak, in 2015, U.S. chicken exports dropped by $1.1 billion, according to USDA data.)

The National Chicken Council, the trade association of meat chickens, does not support the use of a vaccine, said Tom Super, senior vice president of communications for the council. He said most countries, including the United States, won't import vaccinated poultry due to concerns that vaccines can mask the presence of the disease.

""The vaccine will not eliminate the virus,"" he said. ""Birds can still get [the virus] and may not show signs.""

Carol Cardona, Pomeroy chair in avian health at the University of Minnesota, said vaccination would make it more possible to predict and to protect domesticated birds. She warned that not vaccinating could also carry costs and that some animals, such as turkeys, are naturally more vulnerable to the virus.

""Not being reactive is half the battle,"" she said. ""That's why we have to do vaccination. Why would you not? We have the science. It will take a while, and that means we need to start sooner rather than later.""

Sato said that in the last outbreak, in 2015, much of the spread was from farm to farm, truck tires and dirty boots dragging the virus with them. Heightened biosecurity measures, such as quarantining animals and limiting visitors to facilities, have minimized this, but still, if just a few birds test positive for H5N1, the whole flock is killed and disposed of to minimize spread - which increases costs associated with raising replacement birds, but also for protective gear for workers who must deal with infected animals.

According to Swayne, there have been 874 human cases of avian flu since 1997, about 40 percent fatal. Most of the humans who have contracted avian flu since 1997 have been people who worked with poultry or who have been in ""wet"" markets where animals are slaughtered.

""Poultry workers are at risk when birds are dying,"" Cardona said, but added that she would not rule out a more significant outbreak in humans.

""Is it likely in this country? No,"" she said. ""But never say never with flu.""

Bird flu could become the next human pandemic �nd politicians aren� paying attention,1684195200000,"We have the tools to prepare, but post-Covid fatigue and a lack of political will mean they aren� being used
Last month a pet dog in Canada died of H5N1, also known as bird flu, after eating a wild goose. Worryingly this follows a pattern, with an increasing number of bird flu cases appearing in mammals who come into contact with an infected bird, dead or alive.
When you see a wild bird such as a duck or seagull, think bird flu. Because it� actually more likely than not they�e infected with the virus. And many species of wild birds are asymptomatic, meaning that they don� show any symptoms. The risk of transmission to pets is low, but they can get sick from chewing or eating an infected bird, whether it� dead or alive.
I first wrote about bird flu in November, when domestic birds in Britain were put into an indoor lockdown. The virus had become endemic in most wild bird populations. It� incredibly infectious, where one bird could infect as many as 100 others. When infected wild birds encountered domestic birds (such as by flying over and defecating on them underneath), huge problems emerged. Avian flu has a near 100% fatality rate in most poultry, which led to shortages of not only turkey for Christmas but also eggs, as farm after farm was decimated by the disease.
Since November, the signals emerging across the world continue to be worrying. In January and February this year, more than 3,000 sea lions died of bird flu in Peru (where the death toll in wild birds reached an estimated 50,000). In Russia, 700 Caspian seals died. Then several dolphins in Britain and the US died of H5N1. Normally, even if an animal catches H5N1 from a bird, it can� pass it to other mammals. This limits its spread. But the large number of cases in these outbreaks suggest the possibility of mammal-to-mammal transmission, although this hasn� been confirmed yet by genetic sequencing. A more likely hypothesis is that these outbreaks are groups of animals feeding on infected birds. It is not yet 100% clear what� happening.
But the risk of spread among mammals is ever-present. A new research pre-print from Canada showed that H5N1 samples could spread efficiently between ferrets with fatal outcomes. In order to spread efficiently to humans, H5 would need three major categories of genetic changes, according to bird flu expert Prof Richard Webby. So far, the virus has been able to make one of these changes, but not the other two. So right now, H5N1 is a theoretical risk for the next human pandemic, rather than one requiring urgency in response today. And a prime minister or health secretary might say, �hy prepare for something that might never happen?�
To those of us scientists working in global health, there are enough concerning signals that action should already be happening. So that if a certain set of mutations do occur and we see an outbreak in humans in Peru or China or Britain, that the harm it could cause is minimal. This is a disease with an estimated 50-60% fatality rate in humans, including children.
The cornerstone of infectious disease preparedness is in: surveillance (to know what strain is spreading and where in birds); testing (to identify disease quickly in humans); vaccines (for protection against disease and death); and antivirals (to improve clinical outcomes). The US government is already moving in this direction. Rebecca Katz, professor at Georgetown University Medical Center, has noted that a H5 candidate vaccine virus recently produced by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is likely to provide good protection against the circulating H5N1 viruses.
The information has been shared with vaccine manufacturers to start the process of stockpiling adequate doses. But this is a challenge because most influenza vaccines are created by incubating doses in chicken eggs (called egg-based production). If bird flu has killed off many of the chickens, then egg shortages are likely. There� another H5N1 vaccine which is non-egg based, but they could have a maximum of 150m doses ready within six months. The world� population is almost 8 billion.
In addition, the FDA-approved antiviral treatments for seasonal influenza could also work against bird flu. But again, getting doses to all parts of the world is a challenge given shortages. Preparation must also involve appropriate PPE for healthcare workers to protect against a respiratory disease (flu) and diagnostics to quickly identify if someone is infectious in hospitals.
All of these issues are solvable with precise planning, collaboration across countries, scientific ingenuity and good leadership. With post Covid-19 fatigue, the bigger problem is bringing the public along and communicating the facts so that they are trusted and believed. With so much �ften understandable �istrust in our current political leadership, authorities like chief medical officers and independent government advisers become crucial.
At the moment most governments aren� paying attention to bird flu: they�e more interested in another AI (artificial intelligence) rather than this AI (avian influenza), but the avian influenza threat is real, and needs much more immediate attention and preparation.

Human gene identified that prevents most bird flu viruses moving to people,1687910400000,"Discovery means targeted solutions can be directed to avian flu viruses sooner to prevent spillover into humans, say scientists

Scientists have discovered that a gene present in humans is preventing most avian flu viruses moving from birds to people. The gene is present in all humans and can be found in the lungs and upper respiratory tract, where flu viruses replicate. It was already known to scientists, but the gene� antiviral abilities are a new discovery.

A six-year investigative study led by the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research found that the BTN3A3 gene is a powerful barrier against most avian flu viruses.

Although relatively rare, some avian flu virus strains have periodically spilled over into humans. Two of the most recent H5N1 cases were reported in UK poultry farm workers in May this year. Human cases of H5N1 bird flu were first found in Hong Kong in 1997. Globally since 2003, 873 human H5N1 infections have been reported to the World Health Organization. Of those, 458 people died.

The study found that some bird and swine flu viruses have a genetic mutation that allows them to escape the blocking effects of the BTN3A3 gene and infect people. By tracking the history of human influenza pandemics and linking resistance to the gene with key virus types, the researchers concluded that all human influenza pandemics, including the 1918 Spanish flu and the 2009 swine flu pandemics, were a result of BTN3A3-resistant strains.

The findings suggest that resistance to the gene could help determine whether flu strains have human pandemic potential or not. That may lead to testing of wild birds, poultry and other animals susceptible to flu viruses such as pigs, for BTN3A3-resistant viruses.

�he antiviral functions of the [BTN3A3] gene appeared 40m years ago in primates,�aid Prof Massimo Palmarini who led the study and is director of Glasgow� virology research centre. �nderstanding the barriers that block avian flu in humans means better targeted solutions and better control measures to prevent the spillovers.

He said that if a gene-resistant virus was identified, �e can direct preventative measures to those viruses, sooner, to prevent the spillover [into humans]�

Dr Rute Maria Pinto, the study� lead author, said: �t� pretty amazing, isn� it? We are all fairly proud about the outcome. This gene had been identified before, and other functions were attributed to it, but we found that the gene is antiviral against avian flu. No one had found that before.�

She said the discovery was expected to have immediate practical applications. �ow, when we find cases of bird flu, we can basically swab sick birds, carcasses or faeces and find out whether the virus can overcome the BTN3A3 gene, simply by looking at its sequence and determining if this virus is more or less likely to jump into humans. If the virus can in fact overcome BTN3A3 then stricter measurements should be put in place to prevent spillovers.�

Pinto added: �s a scientist we are expected to find solutions to problems, to give back to the taxpayers that fund this [research], and to find something that can be used straight away is really impactful.�

The study was also able to retrospectively identify increases in gene-resistant viruses ahead of previous human spillovers.

Before the H7N9 bird flu virus outbreak, which first infected humans in China in 2013, the study found �n increased frequency of the BTN3A3-resistant genotype [in birds] in 2011-2012� To date there have been almost 1,570 cases of H7N9 and at least 616 deaths.

� guess what these observations provide is a snapshot of what the frequency of the BTN3A3 resistant gene was at different period of times in the birds,�almarini said. �ecause birds haven� got BTN3A3, there is no evolutionary pressure to keep, or not, those traits.�

He said certain mutations �ight make the virus more or less fitter in the birds�ut this had not yet been studied.

Similarly, before the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, the study found H1N1 gene resistance in pigs occurring between 2002 and 2006.

"Cambodia records second bird flu death in a week, third this year, after no cases since 2014",1696896000000,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) � 2-year-old girl is the second person in Cambodia to die of bird flu this week, and the third this year, the country� Health Ministry has announced.

Laboratory tests confirmed that the girl, who lived in the southeastern province of Prey Veng, died Monday with H5N1 avian influenza, the ministry said in a statement.

The ministry had announced on Sunday that a 50-year-old man in neighboring Svay Rieng province also had died from bird flu. In February, an 11-year-old girl became the country� first bird flu fatality since 2014. Her father was also found to be infected but survived.

According to a global tally by the U.N.� World Health Organization, from January 2003 to July 2023, there have 878 cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza reported from 23 countries, 458 of them fatal. Cambodia had recorded 58 cases since 2003 of humans infected with bird flu.

�ince 2003, this virus has spread in bird populations from Asia to Europe and Africa, and to the Americas in 2021, and has become endemic in poultry populations in many countries,�he WHO says on its website. �utbreaks have resulted in millions of poultry infections, several hundred human cases and many human deaths. Human cases have been reported mostly from countries in Asia, but also from countries in Africa, the Americas and Europe.�

The United States�enters for Disease Control and Prevention said last month that bird flu outbreaks were on the rise globally, with more than 21,000 outbreaks across the world between 2013 and 2022. Bird flu only rarely infects humans.

Scientists worry that rising cases of H5N1, particularly in animals that have frequent contact with humans, might lead to a mutated version of the disease that could spread easily between people, triggering another pandemic.

Chhuon Srey Mao, the 22-year-old mother of the dead girl, told The Associated Press by phone from Chhmar Lort village that her daughter fell sick on Oct. 1 with symptoms of coughing, high temperature and vomiting. The girl received treatment from a local physician for five days, but was sent on Oct. 5 to the capital Phnom Penh for advanced care when her condition worsened. She died at the children� hospital.

The mother said that from late September, several chickens in her village, including at least four of her own, had died. She added that she had discarded the chickens that died, not cooking them for food. People have caught the virus both from domestic fowl and from wild birds such as ducks.

� have no idea why my daughter would contract bird flu because she never touched or ate the dead chickens,�hhuon Srey Mao said, �ut I presume that she may have become infected with the virus when she played in the yard, as she normally did, where the chickens had been.�

Centre of deadly bird flu outbreaks shifts from Asia to Europe and Africa,1697673600000,"Increase of virus in wild birds is driving evolution and spread of new strains, researchers found

The epicentre of deadly bird flu outbreaks has shifted from Asia to Europe and Africa, a new study has found.

For 25 years, bird flu viruses typically emerged from Asia, but major changes in the virus and its spread among wild birds mean the outbreaks are shifting. Research shows that while outbreaks in 2016 and 2017 started in China, two new H5 viruses emerged in 2020 in African poultry and in 2022 in European wild birds.

�hese results highlight a shift in the HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5 epicentre beyond Asia,�esearchers write in the paper published in Nature.

The latest outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1 caused Europe� worst bird flu outbreak, before spreading globally. It has now reached every continent except Oceania and Antarctica, killing record numbers of domestic and wild birds, and even jumping into mammals. It can also jump to humans: since 2003, H5N1 was found in 873 humans, resulting in 458 deaths, according to the World Heath Organization. Most cases were linked to the handling of infected poultry, and it is not known to be able to transmit from human to human.

An international team of scientists led by the University of Hong Kong analysed outbreaks between 2005 and 2022, collecting data on confirmed cases from the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health. They also studied 10,000 sets of viral DNA.

Despite the number of outbreaks, only 0.2% of cases were sequenced, researchers said, and urged countries to increase surveillance to understand how the virus is changing. Monitoring infrastructure is particularly weak in Africa, they said. The authors suggest the increasing persistence of avian flu in wild birds is driving the evolution and spread of new strains.

Bird flu is highly infectious, with scientists saying one bird can infect as many as 100, with the virus present in faeces, mucus, blood and saliva. UK government authorities say more than 99% of cases in poultry in the UK have come from wild birds.

Mass culling used to be an effective policy to control the disease� spread in poultry, but because avian flu is now so widespread in wild bird populations, this is proving less effective.

The spread of bird flu within the poultry industry is determined by human activity and how birds are traded. In wild birds, migratory flyways are key indicators of where the disease will spread, with key migration routes along the east Atlantic and Pacific flyways, meaning it has been able to spread to new areas that have never been exposed to it before.

Working out how many wild birds have died is difficult because so many carcasses are never found or counted, but researchers say it will be in the millions.

Person Tests Positive for  Bird Flu  in Texas After Exposure to Cattle; It is the second known human case of  H5N1  infection in the U.S.,1711929600000,"A person in Texas tested positive for avian influenza after exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected with the H5N1 bird flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.

The case marks the second known instance that a person in the U.S. has been infected with H5N1 bird flu. The person reported eye redness, or conjunctivitis, as their only symptom and is being treated with an antiviral drug. The human health risk of the bird flu remains low for the U.S. general public, the CDC said, but people with close, prolonged exposures to infected animals or their environments are at higher risk.

""At this point, there's nothing that suggests that there is any serious risk of a larger human outbreak,"" said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""I'm trying to understand why the cows are getting infected. That's a really important scientific question right now.""

The previous human case was reported in Colorado in 2022, in a person with direct contact with poultry. Human infections are rare, but the agency said it has been monitoring for infections among people exposed to infected birds after reported outbreaks in U.S. poultry and wild birds began in late 2021.

Human illnesses with the virus typically have occurred through exposure to infected poultry or wild birds. Sick birds can shed the virus in their saliva, mucus and feces, and humans can become infected when enough virus gets into their eyes, nose or mouth. Infections have also been reported in other animals including foxes, bears, seals, minks, cats and dogs.

The disease in humans ranges from mild infections, which include upper-respiratory and eye-related symptoms, to severe pneumonia. Since 1997, some 890 human cases have been reported across the globe, with a case-fatality rate of roughly 50%, the CDC said.

""It's still a very uncommon illness in humans,"" Inglesby said. ""It is a very serious infection, but it's possible there are cases that are occurring that we're not detecting that are much milder.""

The U.S. Agriculture Department reported the avian influenza in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas in late March this year. Unpasteurized milk from sick cattle at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, as well as a throat swab from a cow in Texas, tested positive for the same strain of the virus that is currently widespread among birds.

A few days later, the virus was also confirmed among a Michigan dairy herd that had recently added cows from Texas. This is the first time the H5N1 influenza virus has been detected in cattle in the U.S., according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. There was little or no mortality among affected dairy herds, Agriculture Department officials said.

Bird flu has historically been a problem for the poultry industry in the U.S. The current outbreak is the deadliest on record for the U.S. agricultural industry, and has led to the death of tens of millions of chickens, turkeys and other birds since early 2022. Industry officials have attributed the disease's rapid spread to wild birds carrying it to farms during the birds' migration.

The disease is usually fatal in chickens that contract it, the CDC has said, and is contagious enough that wild-bird droppings blown on the wind near barn vents can trigger an outbreak. To curb further spread, poultry farms often destroy entire flocks after a single case is detected.

People should avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals as well as raw milk, feces or other contaminated materials, the CDC said. People also shouldn't prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food, including raw milk, from animals with a confirmed or suspected infection, the agency said.

""For the vast majority of people, this isn't going to affect them,"" said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health. ""Who it will affect are people who have close contact with animals or economic interest in animals.""

There are no concerns with the safety of the commercial milk supply right now because products on store shelves are pasteurized, according to the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration. Dairies must send milk from only healthy animals to processing, and milk must be pasteurized for it to enter interstate commerce for human consumption. Milk from infected animals is being diverted or destroyed, the CDC said.

Patient in Texas diagnosed with bird flu after contact with cows: health officials,1711929600000,"A person in Texas has been diagnosed with a bird flu strain tied to a recent outbreak among dairy cows � becoming the second person ever in the US to contract the virus, federal and state officials said Monday. The patient, who has not been publicly identified, suffered from eye inflammation and was tested for the bird flu last week, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirming the infection over the weekend. Texas officials noted that the patient had been directly exposed to dairy cows presumed to be infected and insisted that the virus does not pose much risk to the general public. The bird flu has recently been discovered in cows. The US Department of Agriculture also confirmed that there are no changes in the bird flu virus, Type A H5N1, that would make it more transmissible to humans. ""While cases among humans in direct contact with infected animals are possible, this indicates that the current risk to the public remains low,"" the department said in a statement over the weekend. The latest infection comes just a week after dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with the virus. Since then, herds in Michigan, Idaho and New Mexico have also tested positive for bird flu. It's the first time the disease has been found in dairy cattle, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. The virus has thrived more in mammals in recent years, the association added. Health officials say the risks of bird flu to the public remain low.

H5N1 avian flu found in Texas individual who apparently was infected by dairy cows,1711929600000,"This is a developing story and will be updated.

Texas health officials reported Monday that an individual who had been in contact with cattle has contracted H5N1 avian flu, only the second case ever recorded in the U.S. The person had contact with dairy cattle that are believed to have been infected with the virus, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement. It went on to say that the individual’s only symptom is eye inflammation — infection of the conjunctiva, the tissue surrounding the eye. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the infected individual is doing well and is being treated with the influenza antiviral oseltamivir, sold as Tamiflu. The individual was instructed to isolate to reduce the risk of infecting others, and to date there’s no indication of onward spread, Shah said. Related: Tracking the bird flu, experts see a familiar threat — and a virus whose course is hard to predict “We are not aware of reports that any of this individual’s close contacts have developed any symptoms,” he told STAT. The person was tested late last week, with confirmatory testing taking place at the CDC over the weekend. The CDC is not currently running any other confirmatory H5 tests, Shah said. “The fact that there are not other samples cooking right now is reassuring, insofar as that we’re not aware of other individuals who are symptomatic following an exposure to livestock,” he added. “We are still out there looking, to be very clear,” he said. “Our antennae are up and we have been working with state public health officials in a number of jurisdictions to look for individuals who report signs and symptoms of illness, to make sure they know how to get tested.” NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy Three states — Texas, Kansas, and Michigan — have recently reported they have had confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in cattle; New Mexico and Idaho have also reported outbreaks in cattle that are presumed to have been caused by H5N1. The virus doesn’t kill the cattle, but milk production is lowered and the animals’ feeding is reduced. Owners of implicated herds have been told to destroy milk produced by infected cattle, though if milk from infected animals made its way into the food chain, pasteurization could kill the virus, the CDC statement said. Up until now, cows have not been on the ever-lengthening list of animals that have been known to be susceptible to this virus. Infections of the highly pathogenic bird flu — a term that describes how it behaves in poultry — have been detected in many other mammals, though, including big cats, bears, foxes, skunks, sea lions, and seals. Despite the alarming increase in the past few years of the virus’s geographic range and the number of species it has been seen to infect, both the World Health Organization and the CDC currently assess its risk to people as low. The news of the case in Texas does not change that, Shah said. Trending Now: This AI company scans penis pictures for STIs. Its unproven tech is in an FDA gray zone H5N1 bird flu has been high on the worry list of experts on emerging diseases for the past two decades. Over that time there have been nearly 900 human infections in 23 countries; just over half of those infections have been fatal. But in recent years the strain of the virus circulating in many parts of the world — including the United States — seems to trigger human infections less frequently than earlier versions of the virus did. And when human cases caused by this strain occur, they are typically mild. A case in point was the country’s first H5 infection, which occurred in 2022. A man who was involved in culling infected poultry in Colorado reported feeling fatigued; he tested positive for the virus. It was unclear if he was actually even infected or simply had viruses in his nose that were picked up by a nasal swab test. The low rate of human infections and the mildness of most cases when they occur has counterbalanced concern about the virus’s astonishing spread. But people who have studied influenza — and this virus in particular — for years do not know what to make of its movement into so many different animal species. Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., called the infections in cows “a head scratcher,” saying he would not have figured cattle to be on the list of animals susceptible to this virus. “​​This particular version of H5 is teaching us a number of things we thought we knew weren’t right,” Webby said. He termed the news of the Texas case “not unexpected, but always a concern.” Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, said the move into cows expands the virus’ range, “but I’m not sure what it portends for humans and swine.” Osterholm said he would be more concerned if there were word that the virus had been found to be infecting pigs. Pigs can be infected with human and avian flu viruses and co-infection of more than one type of virus in pigs can produce reassortants — hybrid viruses that might be more able to infect people. As of now, he believes the risk H5N1 poses is not changed by the infection of cattle. “This all could change in a heartbeat with additional mutations. But there’s no evidence this virus has changed,” Osterholm said.",STAT,yes,yes,"The article reports that over half of the nearly 900 human infections have been fatal, indicating a high mortality rate.

U.S. News: Person Contracts  Bird Flu  After Exposure to Cattle,1712016000000,"A person in Texas tested positive for avian influenza after exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected with the H5N1 bird flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.

It is the second known instance of human infection in the U.S. The person reported eye redness, or conjunctivitis, as the only symptom and is being treated with an antiviral drug. The human health risk of the bird flu remains low for the U.S. general public, the CDC said, but people with close, prolonged exposures to infected animals or their environments are at higher risk.

""At this point, there's nothing that suggests that there is any serious risk of a larger human outbreak,"" said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""I'm trying to understand why the cows are getting infected.""

The previous human case was reported in Colorado in 2022, in a person with direct contact with poultry. The agency said it has been monitoring for infections among people exposed to infected birds since reported outbreaks in U.S. poultry and wild birds began in late 2021.

Human illnesses typically have occurred through exposure to infected poultry or wild birds. Sick birds can shed the virus in their saliva, mucus and feces, and humans can become infected when enough virus gets into their eyes, nose or mouth. Infections have also been reported in animals including foxes, bears, seals, minks, cats and dogs.

The disease in humans ranges from mild infections, which include upper-respiratory and eye-related symptoms, to severe pneumonia. Since 1997, some 890 human cases have been reported worldwide, with a fatality rate of roughly 50%, the CDC said.

""It's still a very uncommon illness in humans,"" Inglesby said, adding that there may be much milder cases that aren't being detected.

The U.S. Agriculture Department reported in late March that unpasteurized milk from sick cattle at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, as well as a throat swab from a cow in Texas, tested positive for the same strain of the virus currently widespread among birds.

A few days later, the virus was found in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently added cows from Texas. This is the first time the H5N1 influenza virus has been detected in cattle in the U.S., according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. There was little or no mortality among affected dairy herds, Agriculture Department officials said.

Bird flu has historically been a problem for the poultry industry in the U.S. The current outbreak has led to the death of tens of millions of chickens, turkeys and other birds since early 2022.

There are no concerns with the safety of the commercial milk supply right now, according to the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration, because dairies must send milk from only healthy animals to processing, and milk must be pasteurized for it to enter interstate commerce for human consumption.

A Farm Worker With Avian Flu Means a Rapid Response Is Urgent,1712016000000,"The discovery of the country� second human case of H5N1 avian flu, found in a Texas dairy farm worker following an outbreak among cows, is worrying and requires prompt and vigorous action.

While officials have so far said the possibility of cow-to-cow transmission �annot be ruled out,� think we can go further than that.

The geography of the outbreak �ick cows in Texas, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio and New Mexico �trongly suggests cows are infecting each other as they move around various farms. The most likely scenario seems to be that a new strain of H5N1 is spreading among cows, rather than the cows being individually infected by sick birds.

Avian flu is not known to transmit well among mammals, including humans, and until now, almost all known cases of H5N1 in humans were people in extended close contact with sick birds. But a cow outbreak �omething unexpected, as cows aren� highly prone to get this �long with likely transmission between cows, means we need to quickly require testing of all dairy workers on affected farms as well as their close contacts, and sample cows in all the dairy farms around the country.

It is possible �nd much easier �o contain an early outbreak when an emergent virus isn� yet adapted to a new host and perhaps not as transmissible. If it gets out and establishes a foothold, then all bets are off. With fatality rates estimated up to 50 percent among humans, H5N1 is not something to gamble with.

Additionally, H5N1 was found in the unpasteurized milk of sick cows. Unpasteurized milk, already a bad idea, would be additionally dangerous to consume right now.

Public officials need to get on top of this quickly, and transparently, telling us the uncertainties as well as their actions.

The government needs to gear up to potentially mass-produce vaccines quickly (which we have against H5N1, though they take time to produce) and ensure early supplies for frontline and health care workers.

It� possible that worst-case scenarios aren� going to come true �et. But evolution is exactly how viruses get to do things they couldn� do before, and letting this deadly one have time to explore the landscape in a potential new host is a disastrously bad idea.",NYTimes,yes,no,The article mentions a fatality rate estimated up to 50 percent among humans for H5N1 but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.,"annot be ruled out,",officials,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0,4,2,8,6,3,5,7,7,3,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,11.8,13.15,0.0536774194,0.1446774194,0.1025806452,0.2797096774,0.0496774194,0.5937419355,0.3072258065,0.1577741935,0.0229354839,0.0899354839,0.0,0.26975,0.0,0.20625,0.0,0.20625,0.56075,0.0,0.291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nytimes,Left
Bird flu detected in dairy worker,1712016000000,"A dairy worker in Texas is being treated for bird flu, only the second human case in the United States of an illness caused by a highly virulent virus that has recently rampaged through dairy cows in five states, federal and state officials said Monday.

The patient, who experienced eye inflammation as the only symptom, was tested for flu late last week, with confirmatory testing performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the weekend. The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu. The newly emerged case does not change the risk for the general public, which remains low, federal officials said.

""The patient worked directly with sick cows at a dairy, so the virus was most likely transmitted through that close contact,"" said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services.

The case has alarmed disease trackers monitoring for the worst-case scenario: human-to-human transmission of the pathogen, which has happened infrequently worldwide, typically among family members engaged in work with animals. And it raises questions about whether this pathogen is now more easily transmitted among mammals.

Texas health officials are working with other state and federal agencies to provide guidance to dairies about precautions workers should take to minimize the risk of transmission from animals and encourage those who become ill to get tested, Van Deusen said.

CDC spokesman Kevin Griffis said the investigation into how widely the virus has spread is ongoing. ""At this time, we are not aware that any of the individual's close contacts have experienced any symptoms,"" he said. Officials do not yet know the specific route of transmission.

While the CDC considers the risk of infection for the general public to be low, people with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.

Still, any time the virus changes ""that makes me sit up and take notice,"" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Its recent emergence in cattle and the likelihood of cow-to-cow transmission represents a worrisome change.

This marks the first time the highly pathogenic avian influenza has been identified in U.S. dairy cattle, the American Veterinary Medical Association said in a statement last week.

Matt Steele, chief executive of the Kansas Cattlemen's Association, said beef and dairy producers constantly check the health of their animals. If an animal appears sick, they'll pull it aside, take its temperature and call in a veterinarian, if needed.

The odds of infected meat or dairy products leaving the farm are ""very, very low,"" Steele said, citing a system of checks and balances between the producers and state and federal agencies. ""This isn't really a major disease outbreak"" that would heavily impact the meat and dairy market, he said.

Human infections with avian influenza viruses are uncommon but have occurred sporadically worldwide. The CDC has been monitoring for illness among people exposed to H5 virusinfected birds since outbreaks were first detected in U.S. wild birds and poultry in 2021.

Until now, only one human case had been identified in the United States. In 2022, a person in Colorado tested positive for the same strain of avian flu. The person was involved in culling poultry presumed to have been infected with H5N1 bird flu. The person reported fatigue for a few days as their only symptom and recovered, according to the CDC.

Human illnesses with H5N1 bird flu have ranged from mild, such as eye infections and upper respiratory symptoms, to severe illness, such as pneumonia, that have resulted in death in other countries.

Experts worry about the potential for viral evolution. There are several scenarios: The virus could remain primarily a threat to animal health and then recede, as it has in the past. It may continue to circulate among animals, but not routinely infect humans. Or, in the worst case, it evolves to spread easily between people and becomes the next pandemic, Rivers said. Such a pandemic would have significant costs to human life, society and the global economy, she said.

Pandemic flu has long been the boogeyman of infectious-disease and public health experts because the influenza virus is known to be wily, constantly changing, with an ability to combine with other influenza viruses to form new subtypes. A pandemic flu occurs when a new strain of influenza emerges that can be transmitted easily from person to person, and for which there is little or no natural immunity.

The more the virus is able to circulate in mammalian species, the greater the opportunity for the pathogen to mutate to spread more efficiently between humans. Although the H5N1 bird flu has rarely infected humans, among the cases that have been diagnosed, the fatality rate is roughly 50 percent.

Rivers said it's important for U.S. policymakers to be proactive. If this strain of bird flu becomes easily spread from human to human, ""the opportunity we have to make a difference is very short,"" she said, because there is no immunity in humans and transmission would be fast. ""You can't adopt a wait-and-see attitude.""

Bird flu is different from the influenza virus that affects humans. Seasonal flu vaccines for humans do not protect against avian viruses.

The CDC, the U.S. Agriculture Department, and the Food and Drug Administration, along with state health and veterinary officials, say they are closely monitoring developments. The CDC has a tool that gauges how likely bird flu will efficiently spread between humans. It was last updated in April 2023, after the virus had spread to a commercial mink farm in Spain.

H5 bird flu is widespread among wild birds and has been documented to infect dozens of other mammalian species, but it rarely spreads between them. These viruses have caused outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry flocks, leading to the culling of millions of poultry. Epidemiologists have been worried about the growing number of mammals infected by the highly pathogenic avian influenza - commonly known as HPAI - around the world.

Last month, HPAI was found in a baby goat in Minnesota, the first case in U.S. livestock.

The virus was detected in dairy herds in Texas and Kansas on March 25. Unpasteurized milk from sick cattle collected from two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, as well as a throat swab from a cow in another dairy in Texas, tested positive. Testing showed the genetic clade to be the same that is widespread among birds globally. Since then, bird flu has spread to additional herds in at least five states, adding evidence that the virus may be spreading cow-to-cow. The strain was confirmed in a Michigan dairy on March 29, and presumptive positive tests have also been reported from Idaho and New Mexico, federal officials said Friday.

Preliminary analysis has not found mutations that would make these viruses resistant to FDA-approved antiviral medications for flu, the CDC said Monday.

The United States has a small amount of bird flu vaccine that targeted an earlier bird flu strain, part of a program to prepare for strains of influenza virus with pandemic potential. With the latest spread of bird flu, vaccine candidates are being developed and tested that are expected to match the current strain, according to an official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.",WaPo,yes,yes,"The article mentions a human fatality rate of roughly 50% for diagnosed cases of H5N1 bird flu.

What we know about H5N1 bird flu in cows �nd the risk to humans,1712102400000,"The discovery of H5N1 bird flu in U.S. cattle �nd the news that at least one person in Texas has been infected, apparently through contact with infected cows �as taken scientists who study influenza by surprise. But after absorbing their shock, several admitted there was evidence to suggest bovine infection could happen �t just hadn� been reported with this particular strain of influenza virus until now. The person had contact with dairy cattle that are believed to have been infected with the virus, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement. It went on to say that the individual’s only symptom is eye inflammation — infection of the conjunctiva, the tissue surrounding the eye. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the infected individual is doing well and is being treated with the influenza antiviral oseltamivir, sold as Tamiflu. The individual was instructed to isolate to reduce the risk of infecting others, and to date there’s no indication of onward spread, Shah said. Related: Tracking the bird flu, experts see a familiar threat — and a virus whose course is hard to predict “We are not aware of reports that any of this individual’s close contacts have developed any symptoms,” he told STAT. The person was tested late last week, with confirmatory testing taking place at the CDC over the weekend. The CDC is not currently running any other confirmatory H5 tests, Shah said. “The fact that there are not other samples cooking right now is reassuring, insofar as that we’re not aware of other individuals who are symptomatic following an exposure to livestock,” he added. “We are still out there looking, to be very clear,” he said. “Our antennae are up and we have been working with state public health officials in a number of jurisdictions to look for individuals who report signs and symptoms of illness, to make sure they know how to get tested.” NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy Three states — Texas, Kansas, and Michigan — have recently reported they have had confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in cattle; New Mexico and Idaho have also reported outbreaks in cattle that are presumed to have been caused by H5N1. The virus doesn’t kill the cattle, but milk production is lowered and the animals’ feeding is reduced. Owners of implicated herds have been told to destroy milk produced by infected cattle, though if milk from infected animals made its way into the food chain, pasteurization could kill the virus, the CDC statement said. Up until now, cows have not been on the ever-lengthening list of animals that have been known to be susceptible to this virus. Infections of the highly pathogenic bird flu — a term that describes how it behaves in poultry — have been detected in many other mammals, though, including big cats, bears, foxes, skunks, sea lions, and seals. Despite the alarming increase in the past few years of the virus’s geographic range and the number of species it has been seen to infect, both the World Health Organization and the CDC currently assess its risk to people as low. The news of the case in Texas does not change that, Shah said. Trending Now: This AI company scans penis pictures for STIs. Its unproven tech is in an FDA gray zone H5N1 bird flu has been high on the worry list of experts on emerging diseases for the past two decades. Over that time there have been nearly 900 human infections in 23 countries; just over half of those infections have been fatal. But in recent years the strain of the virus circulating in many parts of the world — including the United States — seems to trigger human infections less frequently than earlier versions of the virus did. And when human cases caused by this strain occur, they are typically mild. A case in point was the country’s first H5 infection, which occurred in 2022. A man who was involved in culling infected poultry in Colorado reported feeling fatigued; he tested positive for the virus. It was unclear if he was actually even infected or simply had viruses in his nose that were picked up by a nasal swab test. The low rate of human infections and the mildness of most cases when they occur has counterbalanced concern about the virus’s astonishing spread. But people who have studied influenza — and this virus in particular — for years do not know what to make of its movement into so many different animal species. Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., called the infections in cows “a head scratcher,” saying he would not have figured cattle to be on the list of animals susceptible to this virus. “​​This particular version of H5 is teaching us a number of things we thought we knew weren’t right,” Webby said. He termed the news of the Texas case “not unexpected, but always a concern.” Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, said the move into cows expands the virus’ range, “but I’m not sure what it portends for humans and swine.” Osterholm said he would be more concerned if there were word that the virus had been found to be infecting pigs. Pigs can be infected with human and avian flu viruses and co-infection of more than one type of virus in pigs can produce reassortants — hybrid viruses that might be more able to infect people. As of now, he believes the risk H5N1 poses is not changed by the infection of cattle. “This all could change in a heartbeat with additional mutations. But there’s no evidence this virus has changed,” Osterholm said.",STAT,yes,yes,"The article reports that over half of the nearly 900 human infections have been fatal, indicating a high mortality rate.

"Here's the rundown on bird flu's risks, impacts",1712102400000,"After a dairy worker in Texas was infected with a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, disease trackers worry the recent outbreak among cattle could develop into a larger threat.

The risk to the general public remains low, but experts are concerned about the possibility of the H5N1 virus evolving and more easily spreading from birds to other mammals. Here's what to know about bird flu, its symptoms and treatment, and its risk to humans and pets.

What is bird flu?

Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in more than 9,000 wild birds and has affected more than 82 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since early 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm.

Can humans catch bird flu?

It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds - whether the birds are dead or alive - or with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces.

Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks - probably from eating infected wild birds - experts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. Two human cases have been reported in the United States, including the case in Texas, which the CDC announced Monday. The first case was in 2022, when a person in Colorado with direct exposure to poultry tested positive for the same strain.

Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis - an eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes - to more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said.

The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain.

A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus - by sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example - to develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University.

""In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia,"" he said, and then ""the fatality rate is very high.""

What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans?

Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms - fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing.

The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the past 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said.

Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat.

How is it treated?

People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said.

Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans?

Yes, there are vaccines for the bird flu. But they would need to be tested to determine whether they are a match for this specific strain. Vaccine manufacturing would then need to be scaled up and mass-produced.

Can bird flu kill humans?

Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare.

According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and February 2024, 887 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 were reported globally from 23 countries. Of those who were infected, there were 462 deaths.

While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

Could bird flu become the next pandemic?

Each time there is highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person.

That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people.

Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchange of genetic material is a random event.

""If anything, the odds are against it,"" Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although the strain has infected some mammals - including mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm in October 2022 - ""that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans,"" he said.

Can dogs and cats catch bird flu?

Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said.

Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons.

""If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection,"" Cardona said.

Is there an impact to the nation's dairy supply?

Federal agencies are reassuring the public about the nation's dairy supply after the bird flu was recently found in dairy cows.

Since milk products are pasteurized, ""there continues to be no concern about the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,"" the Food and Drug Administration said in a notice on its website.

Only milk from healthy animals is authorized to be distributed into interstate commerce for humans to consume, the agency said, adding that ""pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza."" That means there hasn't been much impact on the country's supply of milk or the cost of dairy products.

Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs?

No. Humans cannot become infected by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs. However, according to the CDC, ""uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia.""

The CDC advises that ""it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States.""

Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry - and other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry - are typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. ""It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products,"" she said. ""They don't even make it into your pet food.""

What about my backyard chickens?

People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said.

Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease.

Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying.

People who have backyard chickens should take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said.

Does risk vary by state or country?

Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. ""The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds, and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable,"" Iqbal said.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world.

Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu?

China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality. But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks.

Britain, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly.

In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds that may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed. Should you worry birds in your area are spreading avian flu? Wild birds - such as ducks, geese and swans - are most likely to be infected with this strain of bird flu, according to the CDC. It can easily be spread to poultry, like chickens and turkey. However, the most common songbirds or other birds found in backyards - like cardinals, robins and pigeons - don't usually carry bird flu viruses dangerous to poultry or humans. Generally, people should avoid direct contact with wild birds, the CDC states. What precautions are federal and state health officials recommending? Federal and state health officials are recommending that people avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals, including cattle, as well as animal carcasses, raw milk, feces, litter or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection. People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or food products, including unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheeses, from animals with confirmed or suspected bird flu. CDC is recommending that farmers and owners of poultry, backyard flock and livestock wear personal protective equipment, such as N95 masks, eye protection and gloves, as well as wash their hands thoroughly when in direct contact - or entering any buildings - with sick or dead birds or other animals, carcasses, or feces or litter of potentially infected animals. People exposed to birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection should be monitored for symptoms of illness for 10 days after the last known exposure, even if they were wearing recommended personal protective equipment. http://www.washingtonpost.com WP20240403faq-birdflu",WaPo,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate with 462 deaths out of 887 cases, which is approximately 52%.

"Bird flu pandemic could be '100 times worse' than COVID, scientists warn",1712188800000,"A bird flu pandemic with the potential to be '100 times worse than COVID' may be on the horizon after a rare human case was discovered in Texas, experts have warned. The H5N1 avian flu has spread rapidly since a new strain was detected in 2020, affecting wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry and backyard flocks. But it has now even been detected in mammals, with cattle herds across four states becoming infected, and on Monday, federal health officials announced that a dairy worker in Texas caught the virus. 'This virus [has been] on the top of the pandemic list for many, many years and probably decades,' Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, a bird flu researcher from Pittsburgh, said at a recent panel discussing the issue, according to the Daily Mail. 'And now we're getting dangerously close to this virus potentially causing a pandemic.' The H5N1 bird flu is spreading rapidly across mammals and has even infected a dairy worker in Texas. via REUTERS He noted that the H5N1 virus has already been detected in species throughout the world and 'has shown the ability to infect a range of mammalian hosts, including humans.' 'So therefore, in my view, I think this is a virus that has the greatest pandemic threat [that is] playing out in plain sight and globally present,' Kuchipudi said. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BRZxwL5y3I? version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=enUS&autohide=2&wmode=transparent&w=640&h=360] John Fulton, a pharmaceutical industry consultant for vaccines and the founder of Canada-based BioNiagara who organized the meeting, also expressed his concerns, the Mail reports. 'This appears to be 100 times worse than COVID � or it could be if it mutates and maintains its high case fatality rate,' he said. 'Once it's mutated to infect humans, we can only hope that the [fatality rate] drops.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has maintained that the threat to humans is low. REUTERS Around 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization. For comparison, COVID currently kills less than 0.1% of those it infects � though at the start of the pandemic, the fatality rate was around 20%. Symptoms of the bird flu are similar to those of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people may not develop noticeable symptoms, but others can develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia. The dairy worker in Texas who was infected has reported 'eye redness (consistent with conjunctivitis)' as their only symptom, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted. 'The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with an antiviral drug for [the] flu,' the CDC said. Around 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization. REUTERS The agency and 'the whole U.S. government is taking this situation very seriously,' CDC Director Mandy Cohen told the Washington Post. She maintained that the virus does not pose much of a risk to the general public, noting that the dairy worker was in direct contact with infected cattle, and the US Department of Agriculture has said there are currently no changes that would make it more transmissible to humans. 'While cases among humans in direct contact with infected animals are possible, this indicates that the current risk to the public remains low,' the department said in a statement over the weekend. But the fact that the virus has been found in cattle could mean it is starting to mutate, Cohen told the Washington Post. 'We had not seen avian flu in cattle prior to last week. That is new,' she said. 'It is a reservoir for [the] virus to circulate and potentially change.' If the virus does mutate enough to infect humans, it could spread rapidly, the European Food Safety Authority warned on Wednesday, according to Fox News.

How dangerous is the bird flu outbreak? Here's what I'm telling my patients.,1712275200000,"I have tracked deadly, massive outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry for the past two decades. Hundreds of millions of birds have died, and there has been frequent spillover to other species, including mink, seals, foxes, skunks and even dogs and cats.

This week, the nation's largest supplier of eggs stopped production after birds at a plant in Texas tested positive. About 2 million chickens were slaughtered to prevent spread of the illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that a person in Texas had contracted the flu but is displaying only mild symptoms.

The public has worried at times about a massive human pandemic, but since 2005, the structure of the bird flu virus has not changed significantly.

That is extremely good news, especially when you consider that gain-of-function research conducted in Dr. Ron Fouchier� lab in the Netherlands in 2011 revealed the mutations needed for bird flu to pass from human to human. Monitoring of the virus in nature has shown that those mutations have yet to occur.

I spoke this week with CDC Director Mandy Cohen, who told me that the current spillover of bird flu to cattle has not shown any significant genetic changes. That is also good news.

The outbreak has occurred only in a few states (Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas), but cattle are brought from state to state and could have picked up the virus from birds. Dr. Cohen told me that the cattle have shown mild upper respiratory symptoms.

Can you import prescriptions? Florida can now import prescription drugs from Canada. It's great news to my patients.

Person with bird flu experienced mild symptoms

The patient in Texas also had mild symptoms �onjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms. She said the man was treated with Tamiflu and quickly got better.

People in close contact with him also were given Tamiflu, as a precaution against further spread.

Dr. Cohen said there is potential for cattle to become the first mammals to become a reservoir of the bird flu. The CDC is working closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track cattle that have or have been exposed to the illness to determine if there is any sustained spread.

Over the past two decades, more than 400 million birds either have died from the disease or been culled to prevent transmission. Yet, human cases remain rare, with only 2,634 cases and about 1,000 deaths.

Bird flu pandemic? Experts look at worst-case scenarios.

Don� get me wrong: It is the potential for the virus to adapt to human transmission over time that keeps many scientists and public health specialists up at night. But far too often, those experts are looking at worst-case scenarios to the detriment of public perception.

Fear is at the heart of public and media reactions to the potential of bird flu and other viruses to become a much-deadlier threat to humans.

Your doctor might not listen to you. AI can help change that.

David Nabarro, a senior World Health Organizations expert on infectious diseases, warned the public in 2005 that up to 150 million people could die of bird flu. And though his prediction was far from reality, it was taken seriously at the time.

Since then, there have been intermittent flare-ups of public fears, stoked by the idea that bird flu will become the WHO� so-called Disease X, a virus with a high death rate that spreads easily and quickly.

But the species barrier that protects us from bird flu is still in place, and the risk to the public remains extremely low, according to the CDC director.

That is not only reassuring now but also is likely to continue to be the case. The greater danger remains the fear of the virus rather than the virus itself.

But there is one major caveat. The road map, developed by Dr. Fouchier, for a mutation deadly to humans could end up in the wrong hands. And that risk is enough to keep everyone up at night.

"Avian Flu  and the Experts Who Cried Wolf; If Americans don't line up for jabs, the public-health establishment will have itself to blame.",1712448000000,"A bird-flu pandemic could ""be 100 times worse than Covid,"" media outlets warn, citing experts. Readers roll their eyes, and for good reason. The press profits from scaring the public, as does the public-health industry.

Covid-19 spurred governments to spend heavily on public-health systems. Yet should another pandemic occur, the U.S. will be in a far worse position to respond to it than it was four years ago. No amount of spending on vaccines and virus surveillance can compensate for the public trust health experts have squandered.

Scientists for decades predicted that a pandemic could arise if a virus spills over from animals to humans. Covid's emergence seemed to validate that. The novel coronavirus was nearly identical to a virus found in bats, though it included some genetic oddities that made it more transmissible among humans.

Further research suggested that these oddities, especially a furin cleavage site, likely resulted from gain-of-function experiments by Chinese scientists that accelerated its adaptation to humans.

Experts such as Anthony Fauci dismissed this hypothesis as a conspiracy theory. Many refused to wrestle with the evidence and ridiculed scientists with unorthodox views on the virus's origins, as well as on lockdowns, school closures and masks. Even when their shibboleths proved harmful, they stuck to them. Can Americans be blamed for doubting experts who now say that the avian flu could pose a great threat to the public, but that the government is well-prepared?

It isn't impossible that the H5N1 avian flu�hich has transmitted from wild birds to chickens and has been found in cattle, mountain lions and raccoons�ould mutate and spread among humans. But it isn't likely.

First identified in Chinese geese in 1996, H5N1 has caused periodic outbreaks among chickens, as well as humans and animals directly exposed to them. There have been 888 documented human cases in 23 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization . This is likely an underestimate, since people with mild symptoms might not have been checked.

A recently infected Texas man, exposed to the virus from sick cattle, developed mild symptoms such as red eyes. This would suggest that the WHO's estimate that the virus is fatal in 50% or more case is inflated. The same was true of Covid, which even before the vaccine became available was nearly 90% less deadly than scientists  initially estimated .

Biden administration officials say that avian flu vaccines have already been developed and could be rapidly manufactured. But don't be surprised if Americans don't line up to get them.

Public-health experts blame ""antivaxxers"" for sowing distrust in jabs. But four years ago, these same people, along with the press, fueled skepticism about the Trump administration's efforts to develop a vaccine. During the summer and autumn of 2020, they warned that the president was in a dangerous rush.

Washington Post reporters on June 1, 2020 , warned that ""scientists fear regulators could come under pressure to approve a vaccine before it is fully vetted for safety and effectiveness."" On Sept. 4, 2020 , the newspaper published an op-ed claiming that ""Trump's rush for a Covid vaccine could make it less likely to work."" The piece warned that past might be prologue, noting the swine-flu vaccine in 1976 ""meant to help President Gerald Ford's election campaign not only proved ineffective but also afflicted hundreds with a paralyzing side effect.""

""The history of vaccines is full of alarming missteps,"" warned medical analyst Kent Sepkowitz  at CNN.com on Sept. 10. ""The current rush to vaccination,"" he opined, ""is most reminiscent"" of a Lyme disease vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998, which was later pulled from the market after complaints about painful side effects spurred lawsuits.

On Sept. 22, 2020, the Washington Post published another op-ed, by former Harvard Medical School professor William Haseltine , warning that ""rushed Moderna and Pfizer trials could bring about similar short-term health consequences or, potentially far worse, lead to long-term health consequences that we won't discover until months or years after the vaccine's approval.""

Democratic politicians including Kamala Harris also suggested that the FDA was politically pliable and that Covid vaccines couldn't be trusted. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he wanted state health officials to review  the vaccine. ""The first question is, is the vaccine safe? Frankly, I'm not going to trust the federal government's opinion.""

According to the Pew Research Center , the share of Americans who said they would probably or definitely get the Covid vaccine plunged to 51% in September 2020 from 72% that May, with an equal reduction among members of both political parties.

The public-health clerisy accuses conservatives of fomenting distrust in science and vaccines. They might look in the mirror. Next pandemic, officials will have a much harder time convincing the public to believe or do anything they say, and they'll have themselves to blame.",WSJ,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, citing the WHO's estimate that the virus is fatal in 50% or more of cases.

"As bird flu spreads, the Biden admin remains dangerously unprepared for another pandemic",1712620800000,"The H5N1 virus � which for 30 years affected mostly birds � is rapidly evolving and spreading globally. The Biden administration is dangerously unready. Over the last two years, H5N1 has jumped from birds to mammals, sickening some 30 species. South American scientists publishing in the prestigious journal Nature report massive ""sea lion die-offs"" and warn about ""mutations of concern"" ""potentially evolving into the next global pandemic."" Here in the United States, dairy cows, never before vulnerable to bird flu, are infected in six states. Is the public in danger? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk is ""low"" but is advising states to be ready with rapid tests. In the United States, only two human cases have been reported. Neither person died. But nearly 1,000 people in other parts of the world have contracted the virus � almost always from touching a sick or dead bird or bird feces. Half died. Some food-safety experts caution against eating runny egg yolks, cheeses made with raw milk and foods made with uncooked eggs. There are too many unknowns to predict whether H5N1 will kill people here. It seems unlikely, but better to be prepared. Here's what needs to change: Don't censure the scientists Like H5N1, COVID-19 was full of unknowns. The federal government's biggest mistake was to aim for an illusion of consensus � rather than welcoming debate. The feds silenced anyone, including scientists, who disagreed. The result was a long string of deadly mistakes, from shuttering businesses to mandatory masking to school closures. Stanford health professor Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and former Harvard medical professor Martin Kulldorff coauthored the Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020 showing that protecting the elderly and vulnerable, rather than shutting down the entire nation, would save more lives. Within hours, federal bigwigs Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci launched a smear campaign to label Bhattacharya and his fellow signers ""fringe epidemiologists."" Worse, the CDC and Department of Homeland Security conspired with major social-media platforms such as YouTube and Twitter (now X) to keep the public from hearing from the government's critics. Censored scientists sued. The case, Murthy v. Missouri, is before the US Supreme Court. The Biden administration is taking the wrong side, claiming censorship protects the nation from ""disinformation."" That's a sign the administration can't be trusted to tell us the truth during the next health scare. Create a domestic supply chain for hospital supplies When COVID-19 struck, the United States was caught short of masks, respirators and other hospital gear. One-third of America's imported medical supplies for COVID came from China. In early 2020, the Chinese Communist Party nationalized medical supplies, cutting off exports. US shortages continue even now. On Nov. 27, 2023, Biden called for ""assessments"" of the nation's domestic production capacity. Sorry, too late for more reports. Time to act. Curb dictatorial governors During COVID-19, state Legislatures like sheep ceded their authority to governors, allowing them to shutter schools, churches, businesses and recreational facilities. Fortunately, some states eventually came to their senses, including New York, and undid those grants of authority or time-limited them. Biden and the left-wing media were highly critical of these states � a sure sign more states need to curb emergency health powers before the next health crisis. Never underestimate government's stupidity Not even four months ago, when public-health authorities were already tracking H5N1's arrival in the United States, the National Institutes of Health awarded funding for a project � Virus Hunters � tasking New York City high schoolers with collecting bird feces from public parks to map the spread of avian influenza. Students will wear face masks and gloves and collect the bird poop with cotton swabs. What could go wrong? Students could contract the virus by touching bird excrement and then their own eyes, nose or mouth, cautions Brown University infectious-disease expert Leonard Mermel.

Fear is at the heart of public and media reactions to the potential of bird flu and other viruses to become a much-deadlier threat to humans.

David Nabarro, a senior World Health Organizations expert on infectious diseases, warned the public in 2005 that up to 150 million people could die of bird flu. And though his prediction was far from reality, it was taken seriously.

Since then, there have been intermittent flare-ups of public fears, stoked by the idea that bird flu will become the WHO's so-called Disease X, a virus with a high death rate that spreads quickly.

But the species barrier that protects us from bird flu is still in place, and the risk to the public remains extremely low, according to the CDC director.

That is not only reassuring now but also is likely to continue to be the case. The greater danger remains the fear of the virus rather than the virus itself.

But there is one major caveat. The road map, developed by Dr. Fouchier, for a mutation deadly to humans could end up in the wrong hands. And that risk is enough to keep everyone up at night.

Why the spread of bird flu to a Texas dairy worker is so alarming,1713225600000,"Since early 2022, a highly pathogenic strain of avian flu, H5N1, has been infecting wild aquatic birds and domestic poultry in the United States. More than 85 million birds in 48 states have died as a result of the virus or have been culled after exposure to infected birds.

This same strain has now spread to cows. Health officials have detected H5N1 in cattle across 16 herds in six states. And this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a case of bird flu in a dairy worker in Texas who likely contracted the virus from cattle.

This is an alarming situation that must be monitored closely. Livestock workers and owners of backyard flocks need to take extra precautions, and clinicians should be on the lookout for new human cases. Most Americans, though, should not be concerned about the risk of avian flu to them at this time.

Avian influenza is not new. The first description of it dates from the late 1800s. Like human flu viruses, there are multiple strains of bird flu. Some strains cause mild or no symptoms. Others are associated with mortality rates as high as 90 to 100 percent in domesticated bird species.

Many bird flu viruses originate in wild aquatic fowl and are then passed on to chickens, turkeys and other domesticated birds. While most transmission occurs among birds, some strains can cross over to infect mammals. The H5N1 strain has already been detected in more than 200 mammals in the United States.

That includes humans. In addition to the Texas dairy worker, an individual in Colorado working with poultry was diagnosed with H5N1 in 2022. The dairy worker's only symptom was eye inflammation, and the poultry worker experienced fatigue. But prior cases from elsewhere in the world have resulted in pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.

Indeed, the specter of severe illness is what makes avian flu a worrisome disease. The World Health Organization reports that 887 people globally have been infected with this strain over the past two decades. The mortality rate was 52 percent.

That is a terrifying number. Though there are approved H5N1-specific vaccines, it will take months to ramp up production. (The current seasonal flu vaccine probably does not prevent avian flu, though the CDC recommends it because it prevents people from contracting the regular flu at the same time.) There are antiviral treatments that should reduce the risk of hospitalization and death, but mortality could still be substantial if many people become infected.

Here's the reassuring part: Transmission among humans has, so far, been uncommon. Most people infected with bird flu worked closely with infected animals. Of those who contracted avian flu from other humans, most were living in the same household with a symptomatic person, resulting in close, prolonged and unprotected exposure. During the current H5N1 outbreaks, there has been no documented human-to-human transmission.

Of course, this could change. The more widespread the virus becomes among other mammalian species, the more it could acquire mutations that facilitate its spread among humans. Clinicians need to be on the lookout for people who work with animals and start experiencing symptoms. Scientists must continue tracking the spread of H5N1 in other species, and the federal government should ensure that a robust plan is in place should widespread vaccine distribution be needed.

For now, most people do not need to change their daily lives. Specifically, they do not need to stop drinking milk or eating chicken. Pasteurizing milk and cooking poultry kills pathogens, including the avian influenza viruses.

Those who have frequent contact with birds should take additional precautions. Bird flu is spread through direct contact with secretions from the animal's mouth or nose, or through its feces. The virus can also be inhaled as well as transmitted from someone touching a contaminated surface and then their mouth, nose or eyes.

The CDC recommends that poultry workers, individuals who rehabilitate birds in sanctuaries and people with backyard flocks use eye protection and a well-fitting face mask if they have to handle sick birds. They should avoid touching their mouth, nose or eyes after contact with possibly contaminated objects. Hand-washing is a must, and workers should change clothes after handling birds. Hobbyists, meanwhile, should observe wild birds at a distance and especially stay away from birds that look sick or have died.

Finally, it's worth remembering that avian flu is one of more than 200 diseases that are spread between animals and humans. Zoonotic diseases have been increasing with warming climates, urbanization and the destruction of natural habitats, which have all accelerated contact between humans and wild animals. Protecting humans from these diseases requires not only better surveillance and expedited vaccine research, but also environmental measures that safeguard biodiversity.",WaPo,yes,yes,"The article reports a human mortality rate of 52% for the H5N1 strain. It provides nuances by mentioning that transmission among humans has been uncommon and that most infections occurred in people working closely with infected animals, suggesting potential ascertainment bias and limited human-to-human transmission.",This is an alarming situation that must be monitored closely.,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,6,2,7,4,3,5,6,7,3,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,9.6,10.83,0.0457816092,0.1014597701,0.0911724138,0.2162873563,0.025183908,0.4784252874,0.2592758621,0.125183908,0.0638505747,0.0687816092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.578,0.0,0.578,0.2576666667,0.0,0.2576666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.656,0.0,0.656,0.773,0.0,0.773,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,wapo,Left
Opinion: What worries scientists like me about bird flu,1713312000000,"(CNN) � The headlines are concerning: ""Highly pathogenic avian influenza found in Texas, Kansas dairy cattle.""
""Bird flu detected in dairy worker."" ""First human case of avian flu in Texas raises alarm."" Could this be how the
next pandemic begins? Well, so far US officials are saying they believe there is minimal risk to the public from the
latest iteration of bird flu.
But with growing evidence of potential mammal-to-mammal spread just weeks after the new bird flu was detected
in cows, many of us in the biosecurity and pandemic preparedness community believe that leaders in capitals
around the globe should be working to get ahead of this new public health threat in case the H5N1 flu virus gains
the ability to spread among humans.
There have also been documented cases of transmission to people: Earlier this month, the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention announced that a second person in the US had tested positive for bird flu. The
first US H5N1 human case was in 2022, involving a poultry worker in Colorado, and the more recent case
involved a dairy worker who had direct contact with infected cattle in Texas. Both human cases had mild
symptoms, were treated and fully recovered, but previous bird flu cases in other parts of the world have been
much more severe, causing fatalities in many cases. What we don't know � and what has scientists worried � is
whether the virus will evolve in a way that enables it to spread more readily among human populations.
In March, a first case was reported of H5N1 virus in cattle and while direct cow-to-cow transmission has yet to be
confirmed, the occurrence of cases in cattle across at least six states suggests that cows may be transmitting the
flu virus directly among themselves as they are transported to different farms, as opposed to being infected by
sick birds.
While we face uncertainty about what will happen next, many scientists say stepped-up government action is
warranted because of the risk that bird flu could turn into a pandemic. Many researchers believe that Covid-19
may have started in a similar way � spreading from animals to humans by first gaining the ability to spread
among mammals that came into contact with humans, and then evolving to transmit directly between humans.
The US and other governments around the world need to take H5N1 seriously and demonstrate that we've
learned the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic that turned our lives upside-down for years. They should take
immediate steps to get out ahead of this risk rather than taking a ""wait and see"" approach.
In the short term, governments should act now to deploy the capacities at their disposal to guard against the
uncontrolled spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus if it evolves to spread between people. This includes funding
research on vaccines that are likely to be effective against the virus, stepping up surveillance of livestock and
humans and wider emergency response planning.
It has been encouraging to hear that the US Department of Health and Human Services has stepped up
surveillance systems and supported testing of potential vaccine candidates that could be more effective against
this strain of bird flu than the existing, limited stocks of H5N1 vaccine developed many years ago.
Moving forward, it will be critical for human and animal health sectors � including the CDC and the US
Department of Agriculture � to work together on bio-surveillance, including by developing a shared approach to
monitoring human and animal populations and by exchanging data, to keep tabs on how the virus is evolving.
Additionally, if the US government succeeds in identifying an effective vaccine for the new bird flu, it will be
important to draw up plans to rapidly produce the vaccine, so that it is ready to go if needed. Further, the US and
other governments should think through how to update and act on their existing pandemic flu response plans in
case H5N1 begins to spread among humans.
To be prepared for a possible outbreak of bird flu, governments around the world need to take these steps now,
even in the face of uncertainty. If they wait for a confirmed outbreak among people, it will be extremely difficult to
prevent the uncontrolled spread of the virus.
It's also time to reassess the long game and make sure that countries around the world have the capacity to
detect and respond to future epidemics and pandemics. According to the Global Health Security Index, there are
significant gaps in countries' pandemic preparedness capabilities.
During the Covid pandemic, we witnessed firsthand that capacity matters when it comes to saving lives.
According to a study released last year by experts from the Brown University Pandemic Center, the Gates
Foundation and NTI, almost all countries that had strong pandemic preparedness capacity at the outset of Covid
had lower death rates than less prepared nations.
A broad range of capacities have been shown to be effective, including disease detection systems, systems for
distributing medical countermeasures and public health infrastructure to deploy non-pharmaceutical interventions.
Playing the long game means investing now to make sure that countries have the capacity they need to respond
to a worst-case H5N1 pandemic or to be prepared for the next one. Given the impact of Covid, it is deeply
disappointing that national governments are not investing the necessary resources to build life-saving pandemic
preparedness capacity. This just doesn't make sense.
In the United States, federal funding for pandemic influenza is far below what we need to effectively tackle this
threat. Government experts have called for $1.15 billion in funding for pandemic influenza for 2025, but the Biden
administration has requested only $335 million. Making matters worse, Congress has made major cuts to
pandemic preparedness funding, as part of the ongoing appropriations process.
This is also an issue internationally. Most countries � even those with ample resources � have not made
financial investments in strengthening pandemic preparedness. The 2021 Global Health Security Index � which
measures national-level pandemic preparedness capacity and which was collaboratively developed by NTI, the
Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Economist Impact � found that 155 out of 195 countries have not
allocated funds within the last three years to improve capacity (aside from public health emergencies) to address
epidemic threats.
The White House just announced a new Global Health Security Strategy, which includes a commitment to work
with 50 countries to build pandemic preparedness capacity. This is a great step in the right direction, but the US
government and their partners will need to make sure they have the financial resources and political will to follow
through on this pledge.
Playing the long game also means supporting the World Bank Pandemic Fund, which is designed to invest in
long-term pandemic preparedness capacity of low- and middle-income countries. The fund received $1.9 billion
dollars in pledged resources from national governments, philanthropic organizations and other groups, but it is
making grants to support valuable capacity building efforts and will soon run out of funds. Experts estimate that it
will take approximately $10 billion per year for at least five years to provide the funding that will allow countries to
build infectious disease detection and response capacity that will be needed to guard against pandemics. We
must do better.
Covid made pandemic risks clear, and unfortunately in many parts of the world, we witnessed the deadly
consequences. Governments need to act quickly and decisively now, to get ahead of the growing H5N1 flu public
health threat, while also investing in long-term capacity building to make sure the world is better prepared for the
next pandemic.

Risk of bird flu spreading to humans is �normous concern� says WHO,1713398400000,"Chief scientist voices fears about H5N1 variant that has �xtraordinarily high�ortality rate in humans

The World Health Organization has raised concerns about the spread of H5N1 bird flu, which has an �xtraordinarily high�ortality rate in humans.

An outbreak that began in 2020 has led to the deaths or killing of tens of millions of poultry. Most recently, the spread of the virus within several mammal species, including in domestic cattle in the US, has increased the risk of spillover to humans, the WHO said.

�his remains I think an enormous concern,�he UN health agency� chief scientist, Jeremy Farrar, told reporters in Geneva.

Cows and goats joined the list of species affected last month � surprising development for experts because they were not thought susceptible to this type of influenza. US authorities reported this month that a person in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to dairy cattle, with 16 herds across six states infected apparently after exposure to wild birds.

The A(H5N1) variant has become � global zoonotic animal pandemic� Farrar said.

�he great concern of course is that in... infecting ducks and chickens and then increasingly mammals, that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically the ability to go from human to human,�e added.

So far, there is no evidence that H5N1 is spreading between humans. But in the hundreds of cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals over the past 20 years, �he mortality rate is extraordinarily high� Farrar said, because humans have no natural immunity to the virus.

From 2003 to 2024, 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 have been reported worldwide from 23 countries, according to the WHO, putting the case fatality rate at 52%.

The recent US case of human infection after contact with an infected mammal highlights the increased risk. When �ou come into the mammalian population, then you�e getting closer to humans� Farrar said, warning that �his virus is just looking for new, novel hosts�

Farrar called for increased monitoring, saying it was �ery important understanding how many human infections are happening... because that� where adaptation [of the virus] will happen�

�t� a tragic thing to say, but if I get infected with H5N1 and I die, that� the end of it,�e said. �f I go around the community and I spread it to somebody else then you start the cycle.�

He said efforts were under way towards the development of vaccines and therapeutics for H5N1, and stressed the need to ensure that regional and national health authorities around the world had the capacity to diagnose the virus.

This was being done so that �f H5N1 did come across to humans, with human-to-human transmission� the world would be �n a position to immediately respond� Farrar said, calling for equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.",Guardian,yes,no,The article reports a high human mortality rate of 52% for H5N1 but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.,This remains I think an enormous concern.,Jeremy Farrar,0.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,6,2,8,5,3,4,7,7,3,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,13.4,14.62,0.0365151515,0.0887878788,0.0343333333,0.2802727273,0.0495454545,0.4804545455,0.3220606061,0.1293333333,0.0582424242,0.1254848485,0.0,0.289,0.0,0.4685,0.0,0.4685,0.289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.516,0.281,0.0,0.797,0.445,0.0,0.0,0.445,,"The great concern of course is that in... infecting ducks and chickens and then increasingly mammals, that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically the ability to go from human to human.",Jeremy Farrar,The mortality rate is extraordinarily high,Jeremy Farrar,0.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,0.0,0.617,0.0,0.0,0.617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.312,0.0,0.0,0.797,0.0,1.609,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"When you come into the mammalian population, then you're getting closer to humans",Jeremy Farrar,"This virus is just looking for new, novel hosts",Jeremy Farrar,Very important understanding how many human infections are happening... because that's where adaptation [of the virus] will happen,Jeremy Farrar,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6016666667,0.0,0.0,0.4403333333,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,guardian,Left

"Bird flu virus now found in milk, is of ""great concern"" to WHO",1713484800000,"A recent statement from the World Health Organization is sure to ruffle a few feathers. The international health group expressed ""great concern"" over the rising number of bird flu cases in humans. The organization also announced Friday that the virus has been found in raw milk. Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at the WHO, noted that the avian flu, also called H5N1, had an ""extremely high"" mortality rate among those who had been infected around the world. Avian flu has now been identified in raw milk, the WHO said Friday. panyawat � stock.adobe.com The illness remains extremely rare in the US, with just two known cases, one that occurred earlier this month and one that occurred in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In both of those cases, the infected individuals worked in close proximity to livestock. No human-to-human transmissions of the disease have occurred. ""The great concern, of course, is that � [the] virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,"" Farrar warned. On Friday, the WHO further warned that the virus has been found in raw milk. Officials said that drinking pasteurized milk � which is the kind sold throughout the US in grocery stores � is still safe. Dairy farmers in the US are also required to destroy milk from infected cows, so it should not make its way into the food supply chain in the first place. The WHO warned that the virus has been found in raw milk. Drinking pasteurized milk is still safe, officials said. 88studio � stock.adobe.com Dr. Wenqing Zhang, who leads the WHO's global flu program, said that the virus had been identified in a ""very high virus concentration in raw milk"" from infected cows, according to the Daily Mail. Researchers are still trying to determine how long the virus might be able to survive in milk. In general, drinking raw milk is always a bad idea, as raw milk can carry other contaminants, like salmonella, listeria and E. coli � all of which can make you sick. Cases of avian flu in humans remain very rare, with just two known infections identified in the US. ZUMAPRESS.com Zhang also reiterated the cases that have been identified in the US and in Europe have been relatively mild. There are two types of avian flu tracked by the CDC � low pathogenic and highly pathogenic. The latter, as you can probably guess, is more serious because it has a higher mortality rate in poultry, 90% � 100% and often within 48 hours. The person in Texas who contracted the illness earlier this month has the highly pathogenic form of the virus. Since January 2022, the CDC notes that over 90 million birds have been infected in 48 states. But the current outbreak isn't just affecting birds, it's affecting cattle as well. Currently, eight states have avian flu cattle outbreaks. The WHO urged US officials to monitor the situation closely because the virus could ""evolve into transmitting in different ways."" Experts have warned of the potential for an avian flu pandemic for years, with some saying it could be ""100 times worse"" than COVID-19. REUTERS see also As bird flu spreads, the Biden admin remains dangerously unprepared for another pandemic ""Do the milking structures of cows create aerosols? Is it the environment which they're living in? Is it the transport system that is spreading this around the country?"" Farrar questioned. ""This is a huge concern and I think we have to � make sure that if H5N1 did come across to humans with human-to-human transmission, that we were in a position to immediately respond with access equitably to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics."" This is hardly the first warning of a potential bird flu pandemic. Earlier this month, scientists sounded the alarm that such a pandemic could be ""100 times worse than COVID."" ""This virus [has been] on the top of the pandemic list for many, many years and probably decades,"" said Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, a bird flu researcher from Pittsburgh, according to the Daily Mail. The only hope, officials went on, is that the virus would be less deadly in humans than it is in birds. ""Once it's mutated to infect humans, we can only hope that the [fatality rate] drops,"" said John Fulton, a pharmaceutical industry consultant for vaccines, according to the Mail. Between 2003 and 2019, 861 cases of the avian flu were identified globally and 455 people have died, meaning that the fatality rate is nearly 53%, according to the CDC. If a pandemic were to occur, the Food and Drug Administration has a few vaccines for humans on hand, Forbes reported.

WHO chief scientist calls for increased monitoring and preparation for highly pathogenic bird flu,1713484800000,"(CNN) � The bird flu spreading through cattle in the United States is an ""enormous concern"" the chief scientist of
the World Health Organization said Thursday as he called for more tracking and preparation for the virus.
So far, there is no evidence that the highly pathogenic H5N1 flu virus can spread from person to person. This flu
strain was first detected in birds in 1996 and has primarily been a threat to farmed and wild fowl, but in the past
two years, an increasing number of mammals have tested positive with the virus, indicating that the virus is
looking for new hosts and moving closer to people.
""The great concern, of course, is that in doing so and infecting ducks and chickens � but now increasingly
mammals � that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to
go from human-to-human transmission,"" Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British medical researcher and chief scientist at
WHO since 2023, told reporters on Thursday in Geneva.
""We have to watch, more than watch, we have to make sure that if H5N1 did come across to humans with
human-to-human transmission that we were in a position to immediately respond with access equitably to
vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.""
Farrar's comments came in a response to a question during a news conference about WHO's new definition for
airborne pathogens.
Though H5N1 doesn't spread from person to person, humans can catch it when they're exposed to infected
animals. In the US, one person in Texas has tested positive for H5N1 this year. That person was working with
cows when they tested positive, and it is believed they caught it from an infected cow.
They are only the second documented case of human H5N1 in the United States. The first was in a poultry
worker in Colorado in 2022.
Though it doesn't spread easily to humans, researchers are worried about it because of how deadly these
infections can be. Since 2003, 889 human cases and 463 deaths have been reported from 23 countries, giving
this virus a case fatality rate of 52%, according to the WHO.
""This virus is a really scary virus. It's something I would hate to see in humans,"" Dr. Richard Webby, director of
the WHO's coordinating center for studies on the ecology of influenza and a scientist at St. Jude's Children's
Research Hospital, told CNN.
Webby, who has been studying H5N1 for 20 years, said even though this virus has never figured out how to
efficiently make people sick, ""what's happening now there are lots more small mammals being infected with this
virus and we've ever seen in the past 20, close to 25 years of monitoring, so that is absolutely concerning,"" he
said.
Webby said H5N1 is more active now than it ever has been, but it still hasn't developed key mutations that
scientists are worried about that could help it infect people.
""Because we haven't seen those changes does suggest to me that this virus has got quite a hurdle to overcome
to become a real sort of human pathogen,"" Webby said.
So far in the United States, the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services has
reported 29 infected herds in eight states � Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, South Dakota, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio
and North Carolina.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that while the current risk to public health from H5N1 is
low, it is monitoring the situation carefully. In an update posted to its situation summary on Thursday, the CDC
said is studying the virus isolated from the recent human case in the US and found it to be susceptible to antiviral
medications.
The agency also said it has created a candidate vaccine virus that can be used as a template to make a vaccine if
needed.",CNN,yes,no,The article reports a high human mortality rate of 52% for H5N1 but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.,"The great concern, of course, is that in doing so and infecting ducks and chickens � but now increasingly mammals � that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans.

WHO's top scientist sounds alarm about bird flu and need for vaccine development,1713484800000,"World Health Organization� top scientist said this week the recent bird flu outbreak is of �reat concern�o public health, and vaccine development to halt the virus is �ot where we need to be.�

The virus, known as Type A H5N1, which typically circulates among poultry and wild birds, has spread to mammals, including cows, cats and at least two people in the U.S. in recent years. The new development experts are eyeing is that the virus is now passing from mammal to mammal.

Bird flu has a high mortality rate in the hundreds of people who've contracted it, Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at WHO, the United Nations health agency, told reporters on Thursday.

Dairy cows, worker: Bird flu outbreak is an 'evolving situation.' Here's what to know about symptoms, spread.

U.S. health officials say the country is ready to ramp up vaccine production if the risk of bird flu rises. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health remains low.

""It's too early to press the panic button,"" Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University and a leading expert in global health, told USA TODAY.

The nightmare scenario, he explained, is if the virus makes a genetic leap and begins human-to-human transmission. This would be worse than the COVID-19 pandemic given how infectious and deadly the virus is, he said.

While no human-to-human transmission has occurred, Farrar, of WHO, expressed concern about recent U.S. cases showing bird flu cases among cattle in several states and a Texas dairy worker. The infection has started to become a pandemic among animal species, he said at a news conference.

�he great concern, of course, is that in doing so �nd infecting ducks and chickens, but now increasingly mammals �hat that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans,�e said. �nd then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission.�

Farrar also flagged his concern that vaccine development is not �here we need to be�nd public health officials don� currently have the capability to diagnose H5N1.

In a statement to USA TODAY, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response said its National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) program is equipped to respond rapidly to influenza strains as they evolve.

�PIVS works closely with industry partners to make and test updated vaccines that match new strains of influenza viruses with pandemic potential as they emerge, while at the same time, supporting manufacturing capacity to allow for large-scale vaccine production if needed,�he statement said.

There are two antigens that are �ell-matched�o the circulating strain of H5N1, the federal agency said. The agency said hundreds of thousands of doses of vaccine could be deployed within weeks, pending regulatory action by the Food and Drug Administration. Within months, federal officials could deploy more than 100 million doses.

But Gostin, of Georgetown, said he doubts that's realistic. While the U.S. is comparatively better, the world lacks the capacity to ramp up hundreds of millions or billions of vaccines for a pandemic with bird flu. And even if the vaccine initially matches virus strains, the virus mutates quickly. He also noted that public health systems lack the ability for early detection and testing of bird flu.

""For many, many decades, these avian and swine influenzas have stayed within the animal kingdom,"" Gostin said. ""The hope and the expectation is that it will continue to do that. But one day, that virus will mutate and go to a human, and then spread to a global pandemic very, very quickly. And we have to be ready for that day.""

Bird flu in dairy cows in eight states, recent human case

Eight states experienced recent bird flu outbreaks in dairy cows beginning in late March in Texas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture believes migratory birds were the source of the infection in cows. The virus then spread from herd to herd, experts believe, suggesting there has been transmission among mammals. Genomic sequencing of the viruses taken from infected cattle indicates this virus is not more transmissible to humans, the USDA said.

On April 1, Texas health officials said a dairy worker was infected with bird flu after close contact with sick cows. The worker �he second person in the U.S. to get bird flu since 2022 �ad symptoms of conjunctivitis or eye redness.

Bird flu spreads primarily through contact with infected birds, including sick or dead animals. Human cases are rare. Most occur in people who've had unprotected exposure to sick animals. The risk is heightened for people who work with infected poultry or livestock, and for veterinarians who treat infected animals.

On Thursday, the WHO said it also updated its terms on airborne diseases for the next expected pandemic. Consulting with health agencies in the U.S., Africa, China and Europe, health officials are opting for �nfectious respiratory particles�nstead of �erosols�r �roplets�o avoid confusion about particle sizes, the U.N. said. This can better coordinate responses to respiratory pathogens, Farrar, of WHO, said.

Bird Flu Is Infecting More Mammals. What Does That Mean for Us?,1713744000000,"In her three decades of working with elephant seals, Dr. Marcela Uhart had never seen anything like the scene on the beaches of Argentina� Vald� Peninsula last October. It was peak breeding season; the beach should have been teeming with harems of fertile females and enormous males battling one another for dominance. Instead, it was �ust carcass upon carcass upon carcass,�ecalled Dr. Uhart, who directs the Latin American wildlife health program at the University of California, Davis. H5N1, one of the many viruses that cause bird flu, had already killed at least 24,000 South American sea lions along the continent� coasts in less than a year. Now it had come for elephant seals. Pups of all ages, from newborns to the fully weaned, lay dead or dying at the high-tide line. Sick pups lay listless, foam oozing from their mouths and noses. Dr. Uhart called it �n image from hell.� In the weeks that followed, she and a colleague �rotected head to toe with gloves, gowns and masks, and periodically dousing themselves with bleach �arefully documented the devastation. Team members stood atop the nearby cliffs, assessing the toll with drones. What they found was staggering: The virus had killed an estimated 17,400 seal pups, more than 95 percent of the colony� young animals. The catastrophe was the latest in a bird flu epidemic that has whipped around the world since 2020, prompting authorities on multiple continents to kill poultry and other birds by the millions. In the United States alone, more than 90 million birds have been culled in a futile attempt to deter the virus. There has been no stopping H5N1. Avian flu viruses tend to be picky about their hosts, typically sticking to one kind of wild bird. But this one has rapidly infiltrated an astonishingly wide array of birds and animals, from squirrels and skunks to bottlenose dolphins, polar bears and, most recently, dairy cows. �n my flu career, we have not seen a virus that expands its host range quite like this,�aid Troy Sutton, a virologist who studies avian and human influenza viruses at Penn State University. The blow to sea mammals, and to dairy and poultry industries, is worrying enough. But a bigger concern, experts said, is what these developments portend: The virus is adapting to mammals, edging closer to spreading among people. A human pandemic is by no means inevitable. So far at least, the changes in the virus do not signal that H5N1 can cause a pandemic, Dr. Sutton said. Still, he said, �e really don� know how to interpret this or what it means.� Marine mortalities A highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 was identified in 1996 in domestic waterfowl in China. The next year, 18 people in Hong Kong became infected with the virus, and six died. The virus then went silent, but it resurfaced in Hong Kong in 2003. Since then, it has caused dozens of outbreaks in poultry and affected more than 800 people who were in close contact with the birds. All the while, it continued to evolve. The version of H5N1 currently racing across the world emerged in Europe in 2020 and spread quickly to Africa and Asia. It killed scores of farmed birds, but unlike its predecessors it also spread widely among wild birds and into many other animals. Most infections of mammals were probably �ead-end�ases: a fox, perhaps, that ate an infected bird and died without passing on the virus. But a few larger outbreaks suggested that H5N1 was capable of more. The first clue came in the summer of 2022, when the virus killed hundreds of seals in New England and Quebec. A few months later, it infiltrated a mink farm in Spain. In the mink, at least, the most likely explanation was that H5N1 had adapted to spread among the animals. The scale of the outbreaks in sea mammals in South America underscored that probability. �ven intuitively, I would think that mammal-to-mammal transmission is very likely,�aid Malik Peiris, a virologist and expert in bird flu at the University of Hong Kong. After it was first detected in South America, in birds in Colombia in October 2022, the virus swept down the Pacific coast to Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the continent, and up the Atlantic coast. Along the way, it killed hundreds of thousands of seabirds, and tens of thousands of sea lions, in Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. The sea lions behaved erratically, experiencing convulsions and paralysis; pregnant females miscarried their fetuses. �hat happened when the virus moved to South America we had never seen before,�r. Uhart said. Exactly how and when the virus jumped to marine mammals is unclear, but the sea lions most likely came into close contact with infected birds or contaminated droppings. (Although fish make up the bulk of sea lions�iet, they do sometimes eat birds.) At some point, it� likely the virus evolved to spread directly among the marine mammals: In Argentina, the sea lion deaths did not coincide with the mass mortality of wild birds. �his could suggest that the infection source was not the infected birds,�aid Dr. Pablo Plaza, a wildlife veterinarian at the National University of Comahue and National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina. It is not hard to imagine how the virus might disperse in these animals: Elephant seals and sea lions both breed in colonies, crowding together on beaches where they fight, mate and bark at one another. Elephant seals sneeze all day, dispersing large droplets of mucus each time they do. It is difficult to prove exactly how and when the virus moved from one species to another. But genetic analysis supports the theory the marine mammals acquired their infections from one another, not birds. Samples of virus isolated from sea lions in Peru and Chile and from the elephant seals in Argentina all share about 15 mutations not seen in the birds; the same mutations were also present in a Chilean man who was infected last year. There are numerous opportunities for H5N1 to jump from sea mammals into people. One sick male elephant seal that sat for a day and a half on a public beach in Argentina turned out to carry enormous amounts of virus. In Peru, scientists collected samples from sea lion carcasses that lay alongside families enjoying a beach day. Scavenging animals, such as dogs, could also pick up the virus from an infected carcass and then spread it more broadly: �one of the wildlife exists in their little silos,�aid Wendy Puryear, a virologist at Tufts University who studied the New England seal outbreaks. In some South American countries, apart from a few carcasses that were buried, the rest have remained on the beaches, rotting and scavenged upon. �ow do you even scale up to remove 17,000 dead bodies out in the middle of nowhere, places where you can� even bring down machinery, and humongous cliffs?�r. Uhart said. A mutating pathogen Flu viruses are adept at picking up new mutations; when two types of flu virus infect the same animal, they can shuffle their genetic material and generate new versions. It is unclear exactly how, and how much, the H5N1 virus has changed since it first emerged. One study last year showed that after the virus entered the United States, it quickly mixed with other flu viruses circulating here and morphed into various versions �ome mild, others causing severe neurological symptoms. �o now after 20 years of reassortment, you have a virus that actually does extraordinary well in a whole variety of avian and mammal species,�aid Vincent Munster, a virologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has studied the mutations needed for H5N1 to adapt to people. Every new species that harbors the virus creates opportunities for H5N1 to continue to evolve, and to jump into people. And the virus may stumble across mutations that no one has yet considered, allowing it to breach the species barrier. That is what happened in the 2009 swine flu outbreak. That virus did not have the mutations thought to be needed to infect people easily. Instead, �t had these other mutations that no one knew about or thought about before then,�aid Louise Moncla, an evolutionary biologist who studies avian influenza at the University of Pennsylvania. Still, even if the virus jumps to people, �e may not see the level of mortality that we�e really concerned about,�aid Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University. �reexisting immunity to seasonal flu strains will provide some protection from severe disease.� What happens next The U.S. is prepared for an influenza pandemic, with some stockpiled vaccines and antivirals, but its efforts at monitoring the virus may not pick it up quickly enough to deploy those tools. It took several weeks before farmers, and then officials, knew that H5N1 was circulating in dairy cows. The dairy farm outbreak has resulted in only one mild human infection, but farms are fertile ground for the virus to jump species �rom cat to cow to pig and human, in any order. Many scientists worry in particular about pigs, which are susceptible to both human and avian flu strains, providing the perfect mixing bowl for viruses to swap genes. Pigs are slaughtered when very young, and newer generations, with no prior exposure to flu, are particularly vulnerable to infections. So far, H5N1 does not seem adept at infecting pigs, but that could change as it acquires new mutations. � never let my kids go to a state fair or animal farm, I� one of those parents,�r. Lakdawala said. �nd it� mostly because I know that the number of interactions that we increase with animals, the more opportunities there are.� Should H5N1 adapt to people, federal officials will need to work together and with their international counterparts. Nationalism, competition and bureaucracy can all slow down the exchange of information that is crucial in a developing outbreak. In some ways, the current spread among dairy cows is an opportunity to practice the drill, said Rick Bright, the chief executive of Bright Global Health, a consulting company that focuses on improving responses to public health emergencies. But the U.S. Agriculture Department has been too limited in its approach to testing cows, and has not been as timely and transparent with its findings as it should have been, he said. On Wednesday, the department ordered that dairy cows moving across state lines to be tested for influenza. Dr. Rosemary Sifford, the department� chief veterinarian, said the staff there were working hard to share information as quickly as they can. �his is considered an emerging disease,�he said. Government leaders are typically cautious, wanting to see more data. But �iven the rapid speed at which this can spread and the devastating illness that it can cause if our leaders are hesitant and don� pull the right triggers at the right time, we will be caught flat-footed once again,�r. Bright said. �f we don� give it the panic but we give it the respect and due diligence,�e added, alluding to the virus, � believe we can manage it.�",NYTimes,no,no,"The article does not mention a high human mortality rate related to bird flu.

Why we shouldn't panic if bird flu becomes the next pandemic,1713830400000,"It's true that the recent spread of bird flu among dairy cows is an ""enormous concern,"" as Jeremy Farrar, the World Health Organization's chief scientist, described it last week. While only two people in the United States have contracted this H5N1 strain of the avian flu (one last year and one this month), wider spread could be catastrophic, given that, in past outbreaks, the disease has killed one of every two people who are infected.

But before anyone panics, let's take a step back and look at the facts. Health officials have a plan in the event avian flu becomes the next pandemic. In fact, as Dawn O'Connell, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, told me, the federal government is much better prepared to respond to pandemic influenza than it was for covid-19.

To start, it's much easier today to access personal protective equipment such as masks, gowns and goggles through commercial markets than it was before the coronavirus hit. But even if those supply chains are ""pinched,"" O'Connell said, the Strategic National Stockpile has plenty to provide for farms, health-care systems and other affected entities.

The stockpile also contains the antiviral medication Tamiflu, which works against seasonal flu and is expected to work well against H5N1. Like antivirals for covid, Tamiflu reduces the chance of an influenza infection becoming severe when taken soon after symptoms emerge. Unlike covid treatments, however, Tamiflu can also be given to close contacts of infected individuals to prevent them from falling ill.

O'Connell explained there are tens of millions of courses of Tamiflu available in the national stockpile. The federal government has also funded states to build their own stockpiles, which means ""tens of millions"" more treatments are available. And this is on top of commercially available Tamiflu, which people can buy at pharmacies with a prescription from their doctors.

Another key preventive measure is vaccines. O'Connell, who also oversees vaccine-preparedness efforts, explained that the federal government contracts with three manufacturers that can make avian flu vaccines. Each uses the three platforms approved by the Food and Drug Administration to develop the vaccines: egg-based, cell-based and recombinant. That means if one platform doesn't work, or if one company encounters production problems, there are other options.

Moreover, because quite a few influenza strains have already been identified, the federal government keeps a library of antigens, which are used in vaccines to trigger an immune response to flu viruses. Every year, for the seasonal flu shot, scientists try to predict which strains will be dominant that fall. They then analyze existing antigens, test them against the strains, and select the closest-matching antigens to make that year's flu vaccine.

Two antigens in the library appear to match H5N1, O'Connell said. The federal government also has adjuvants, the component of vaccines needed to help enhance the body's immune response to the shot, ready for the bird-flu shot as well.

In fact, the federal government has already developed hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses that are ready to be deployed against the avian H5N1 strain. In addition, they have 10 million doses that need finishing touches, which could be completed within weeks.

If more are needed, there are two options. The first is to make more vaccines using the same technology as seasonal vaccines. O'Connell estimates that manufacturers could produce 125 million doses within 130 days. Because the vaccine is a two-dose vaccine, this would only cover a fraction of the U.S. population.

The second option would be to pursue mRNA vaccines, which could be made much faster than the traditional platforms. Even if these vaccines end up not being as effective or as durable as traditional ones, they could be a useful first shot that buys time for additional vaccines to be made.

Of course, there is a third option, which is to scale up vaccine production now. O'Connell has a good answer as to why this isn't happening: To make hundreds of millions of doses of avian flu vaccines, manufacturers would have to stop producing seasonal flu shots. This would also takes a lot of extra funding from Congress. ""We'd have to be sure that we were in a position that it warrants that,"" she said.

With no evidence of human-to-human transmission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has assessed that the risk to humans is low. Therefore, we have not yet reached the point where ramping up vaccine production is necessary. But if we did, it is reassuring to know that the United States would be in a better place to respond compared with the start of the covid pandemic.",WaPo,yes,no,The article mentions a high human mortality rate of one in every two people infected in past outbreaks but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.,enormous concern,Jeremy Farrar,0.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,2,3,1,5,2,1,7,6,4,6,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,10.3,11.69,0.0531184211,0.1388289474,0.0220131579,0.1879605263,0.0471973684,0.3500394737,0.4070263158,0.0869473684,0.0605657895,0.1604342105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5963333333,0.0,0.8463333333,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,pinched,Dawn O'Connell,tens of millions,Dawn O'Connell,0.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,We'd have to be sure that we were in a position that it warrants that,Dawn O'Connell,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,wapo,Left
What to know about the latest bird flu outbreak in the US,1713916800000,"A poultry facility in Michigan and egg producer in Texas both reported outbreaks of avian flu this week. The latest developments on the virus also include infected dairy cows and the first known instance of a human catching bird flu from a mammal.

Although health officials say the risk to the public remains low, there is rising concern, emerging in part from news that the largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S. reported an outbreak.

Here are some key things to know about the disease.

WHAT ARE EXPERTS SAYING?

Dr. Mandy Cohen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency is taking bird flu seriously, but stressed that the virus has already been well studied.

�he fact that it is in cattle now definitely raises our concern level,�ohen said, noting that it means farmworkers who work with cattle �nd not just those working with birds �ay need to take precautions.

The good news is that �t� not a new strain of the virus,�ohen added. �his is known to us and we�e been studying it, and frankly, we�e been preparing for avian flu for 20 years.�

WHAT IS BIRD FLU?

Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but others chiefly occur in animals. Avian viruses spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry.

The bird flu virus drawing attention today �ype A H5N1 �as first identified in 1959. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself.

Since 2020, the virus has been spreading among more animal species �ncluding dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises �n scores of countries.

In the U.S., this version of the bird flu has been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks. Nationwide, tens of millions of chickens have died from the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading.

Last week, U.S. officials said it had been found in livestock. As of Tuesday, it had been discovered in dairy herds in five states �daho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas �ccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE GET BIRD FLU?

This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. In the past two decades, nearly 900 people have been diagnosed globally with bird flu and more than 460 people have died, according to the World Health Organization.

There have been only two cases in the U.S., and neither were fatal.

In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.

This week, Texas health officials announced that a person who had been in contact with cows had been diagnosed with bird flu. Their only reported symptom was eye redness.

WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF BIRD FLU?

Symptoms are similar to that of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people don� have noticeable symptoms, but others develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia.

CAN IT SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE?

The vast majority of infected people have gotten it directly from birds, but scientists are on guard for any sign of spread among people.

There have been a few instances when that apparently happened �ost recently in 2007 in Asia. In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home.

U.S. health officials have stressed that the current public health risk is low and that there is no sign that bird flu is spreading person to person.

WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT?

While it's too early to quantify the potential economic impact of a bird flu outbreak, many of these latest developments are concerning, particularly the transmission of the virus from one species to another, said Darin Detwiler, a food safety and policy expert at Northeastern University.

�e don't have a magic forcefield, an invisible shield that protects land and water runoff from impacting other species,�etwiler said. �here is a concern in terms of how this might impact other markets, the egg market, the beef market.�

If the outbreak is not quickly contained, consumers could ultimately see higher prices, and if it continues to spread, some industries could experience �eputational strain,"" possibly affecting the export industry, Detwiler added.

The egg industry already is experiencing some tightening of supply following detections of bird flu late in 2023 and in early January, coupled with the busy Easter season, where Americans typically consume an average of 3 billion eggs, said Marc Dresner, a spokesperson for the American Egg Board.

Still, even with the outbreak in Texas and the nearly 2 million birds that were killed there, Dresner said there are an estimated 310 million egg laying hens in the U.S. and wholesale egg prices are down about 25% from a February peak.

"American cows now have bird flu, too �ut it� time for planning, not panic",1714089600000,"This is not a repeat of the Covid pandemic. Yet global governments should follow the US and prepare a response

Avian flu, or H5N1, is making headlines in the United States. The past few years have seen concerning signs of it spreading across the world �hether in chickens in Britain, sea lions in Peru, or Caspian seals in Russia. This time, it is has been confirmed in American cows, and the World Health Organization has warned that the risk of it spreading to humans is of �enormous concern �

While it is early days, the hypothesis is that in late 2023, a single cow was infected by coming into contact with infected birds�aeces, or having infected dead birds in its feed. This began cow-to-cow transmission, and potentially even cow-to-bird transmission. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also confirmed one human case of H5N1 in a farm worker, which could either represent cow-to-human (not seen before) or bird-to-human transmission.

Since being identified in late March this year (meaning it was spreading for months among cattle unnoticed), the virus has been confirmed in 33 herds in eight states. Given how infectious H5N1 is (the R number can be as high as 100 among birds �eaning each infected bird could infect 100 others �nd is still unknown for cows), and the fact cows are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, it� likely that the spread is much farther across the country, and has perhaps reached outside the US to importers of US cattle. The US Food and Drug Administration also noted that it had found traces of the virus in roughly one in five commercially bought milk samples through PCR testing, which detects both live and dead virus fragments. Further testing is being done by the FDA to confirm that pasteurisation kills the virus; early research has found that live virus could not be grown from the milk.

The risk to the general population is still considered low, given H5N1 does not appear to transmit from human to human. Those most at risk are farm and poultry workers close to infected animals who get the virus in their eyes, nose or mouth, or inhale droplets at close range. However, the confirmed mammal-to-mammal transmission in the US is concerning to researchers given the potential for further mutations through intermediaries, such as cows, cats or pigs.

If mutations enable human-to-human spread, avian flu would become the top priority for governments around the world. The fatality rate is estimated by the World Health Organizationat 52%, including young people. The US government is preparing for this scenario with a testing, treatment and vaccine plan. They confirmed this week in a press briefing that Tamiflu, a flu antiviral, is seen to be an effective treatment and is being stockpiled. Two candidate vaccines, which have been stockpiled in the US, also look well matched to this strain. We also know (all too well) that respiratory viruses spread rapidly and are very hard to contain without restrictive measures. But this is a totally different situation to SARS-CoV-2, when it took a year to develop testing, treatments and vaccines for a novel virus �e are much better prepared.

The infected cows across the pond have not triggered a UK government briefing or response yet, given that it is seen so far as a US problem, and we import our beef largely from the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands.

Unlike poultry, where even one infected bird results in the culling of the entire flock, there� no talk of killing infected cows. They can cost up to $2,500 each, are largely symptom-free, and there� resistance from farmers to having their herds tested given the impact on their business and sales. There is no simple answer for how to contain the virus in cattle, and resolve the tension between human health imperatives and the agricultural industry. In addition, the medical world and veterinary community are notoriously bad at communicating and working together. Prof Rebecca Katz, co-author of The Outbreak Atlas, said: �his is a perfect example of the importance of operationalising One Health [a unified approach to optimising the health of humans, animals and ecosystems] and collaborations between the animal and human health sectors.�

The main message is there� no need to panic, and this is not a repeat of the Covid-19 pandemic. H5N1 spreading mammal-to-mammal marks a step-change in the development of the disease, and there is an increased risk for humans in close contact with farms in the US. Even if it does spread into humans, the US government seems to be ahead of the curve in preparing a response plan to limit the impact on lives and livelihoods. But other governments would be wise to take heed and plan for all scenarios. To the research community trying to make sense of what� happening, this seems to have come out of the blue �hich just shows how wily and unpredictable viruses can be, and how we�e in a constant race to stay ahead of them.

"Bird flu explained: How it spreads, milk and egg safety and more",1714348800000,"After a dairy worker in Texas was infected with a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, disease trackers worry the recent outbreak among cattle could develop into a larger threat. Federal officials are now requiring lactating dairy cows to test negative for the virus before moving across state lines.

The risk to the general public remains low, but experts are concerned about the possibility of the H5N1 virus evolving and more easily spreading from birds to other mammals. Here's what to know about bird flu, its symptoms and treatment, and its risk to humans and pets.

What is bird flu?Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in more than 9,000 wild birds and has affected more than 82 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since early 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm.

Can humans catch bird flu?It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds �hether the birds are dead or alive �r with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces.

Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks �robably from eating infected wild birds �xperts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. Two human cases have been reported in the United States, including the case in Texas, which the CDC announced Monday. The first case was in 2022, when a person in Colorado with direct exposure to poultry tested positive for the same strain.

Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis �n eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes �o more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said.

The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain.

A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus �y sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example �o develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University.

""In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia,"" he said, and then ""the fatality rate is very high.""

Is it safe to drink milk and eat cheese and yogurt?Federal agencies are reassuring the public about the nation's dairy supply after the bird flu was recently found in dairy cows and viral fragments were discovered in milk sold at grocery stores.

Experts say the mere presence of viral particles is not surprising and does not mean people can get infected by consuming products containing them. Since milk products are pasteurized, ""there continues to be no concern about the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,"" the Food and Drug Administration said in a notice on its website. That applies to other dairy products, including cheese, yogurt and ice cream, but officials are doing additional studies to see if there are any differences with other milk products containing viral fragments.

Only milk from healthy animals is authorized to be distributed into interstate commerce for humans to consume, the agency said, adding that ""pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza."" That means there hasn't been much impact on the country's supply of milk or the cost of dairy products.

Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs?No. Humans cannot become infected by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs. However, according to the CDC, ""uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia.""

The CDC advises that ""it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States.""

Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry �nd other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry �re typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. ""It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products,"" she said. ""They don't even make it into your pet food.""

What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans?Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms �ever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing.

The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the past 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said.

Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat.

How is it treated?People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said.

Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans?Yes, there are vaccines for the bird flu. But they would need to be tested to determine whether they are a match for this specific strain. Vaccine manufacturing would then need to be scaled up and mass-produced.

Can bird flu kill humans? Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare.

According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and February 2024, 887 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 were reported globally from 23 countries. Of those who were infected, there were 462 deaths.

While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

Could bird flu become the next pandemic?Each time there is highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person.

That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people.

Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchange of genetic material is a random event.

""If anything, the odds are against it,"" Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although the strain has infected some mammals �ncluding mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm in October 2022 �that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans,"" he said.

Can dogs and cats catch bird flu?Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said.

Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons.

""If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection,"" Cardona said.

What about my backyard chickens?People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said.

Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease.

Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying.

People who have backyard chickens should take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said.

Does risk vary by state or country?Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. ""The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds, and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable,"" Iqbal said.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world.

Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu?China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality. But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks.

Britain, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly. In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds that may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed. Should you worry birds in your area are spreading avian flu?Wild birds �uch as ducks, geese and swans �re most likely to be infected with this strain of bird flu, according to the CDC. It can easily be spread to poultry, like chickens and turkey. However, the most common songbirds or other birds found in backyards �ike cardinals, robins and pigeons �on't usually carry bird flu viruses dangerous to poultry or humans. Generally, people should avoid direct contact with wild birds, the CDC states. What precautions are federal and state health officials recommending?Federal and state health officials are recommending that people avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals, including cattle, as well as animal carcasses, raw milk, feces, litter or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection. An order issued by the U.S. Agriculture Department requires lactating dairy cows to be tested before moving across state lines. Those that test positive would have to wait 30 days and test negative before being moved, officials said. People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or food products, including unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheeses, from animals with confirmed or suspected bird flu. CDC is recommending that farmers and owners of poultry, backyard flock and livestock wear personal protective equipment, such as N95 masks, eye protection and gloves, as well as wash their hands thoroughly when in direct contact �r entering any buildings �ith sick or dead birds or other animals, carcasses, or feces or litter of potentially infected animals. People exposed to birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection should be monitored for symptoms of illness for 10 days after the last known exposure, even if they were wearing recommended personal protective equipment.

"What we�e starting to learn about H5N1 in cows, and the risk to people",1714435200000,"The H5N1 bird flu virus has been around for decades, and the damage it wreaks on chickens and other poultry is well documented. But the recent discovery that the virus has jumped into dairy cattle �hose udders seem to be where the virus either infects or migrates to �as dumbfounded scientists and agricultural authorities. Questions for which there are pretty clear answers when it comes to birds are suddenly unsettled science in cows. How are they getting infected? Are they transmitting the virus cow to cow, or are human actions �ctivities that are part of the day-to-day of farming � erving as an unrecognized amplifier of viral transmission? In the interface between infected cows and humans, how might people be at risk? Does consuming milk laced with live H5 virus pose a hazard? At this point in the H5N1-in-cows story, these are questions that don’t have solid answers, though some evidence is coming into focus. Getting answers is critical, for controlling spread among cows, if that’s still possible; stopping transmission from cows to key species like poultry or pigs; and keeping the virus from getting a foothold in the human population. Let’s explore the little we know, and the much more we don’t know. Are cows spreading the virus the way people transmit flu? Wash your hands; cover your cough; wear a mask. These are things public health officials advise at the start of each flu season. That’s because the influenza viruses that typically infect humans spread primarily through the air — either through small, virus-laced particles that can be inhaled, or through larger droplets that spray out of a sick person’s mouth when they cough or sneeze. Related: Massive amounts of H5N1 vaccine would be needed if there’s a bird flu pandemic. Can we make enough? Scientists are now trying to figure out if cows are passing around the H5N1 bird flu in the same way. So far, it seems possible, but unlikely to be the main driver of disease transmission. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said few tests from the respiratory tracts of infected cows have come back positive — and those that did showed there wasn’t a lot of virus present. But there is at least some evidence that H5N1 is on occasion getting deep into the respiratory tracts of cows. The USDA said in a frequently asked questions document it released last week that its National Veterinary Services Laboratories had found H5N1 in a lung tissue sample from an asymptomatic dairy cow that originated from an affected herd. So what is the main driver of infection among cows? While the contribution of respiratory transmission is still in question, there appears to be little doubt that a lot of spread is happening in milking parlors, where cows are strapped into the milking machines, and that in dairy cows, H5N1 seems to be primarily infecting mammary glands. The amount of virus in the udders of infected cows is off-the-charts high, making it easy to see how one cow’s infection soon becomes a herd’s problem. “You can imagine that if such a cow is milked in a milking stall, even a few drops of milk remaining on the teat cup which is used to milk will then subsequently contaminate the teat of the next cow,” said Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. “So you can imagine very easily how, in the course of a few days, the virus could spread very fast among the cows being milked on that farm.” That fits with other evidence: the fact that infections so far appear to be limited to lactating dairy cows, and that the members of a herd that are the biggest milk producers — which are also the animals that stay on milking machines the longest — are the ones most heavily impacted by the disease. “There’s still a lot that’s unknown, but what we’re seeing right now is not a respiratory disease by and large; it’s a mastitic disease,” said Jared Taylor, a professor of veterinary pathobiology at Oklahoma State University. For now, that’s somewhat reassuring, because it means that increased attention to sterilization and disinfection during milking should make a dent in the virus’s further spread. But he stressed that it’s still early and researchers are just starting to study the extent to which there could be respiratory involvement. Related: There’s never a good time to drink raw milk. But now’s a really bad time as bird flu infects cows Taylor noted another worry: H5N1, which is notorious for its ability to evolve, is being given a huge opportunity to adapt to bovine hosts. “The concern is if it becomes effective as a respiratory pathogen in cattle, it’s more likely to become effective as a respiratory pathogen in humans,” he said. When are infected cows most contagious? Little is known about how a cow’s contagiousness changes over the course of an infection with H5N1. Researchers examining outbreaks among dairy cattle in Kansas and Texas found that on affected farms, incidence of the disease peaked four to six days after the first animals began showing symptoms such as lethargy, fever, reduced feed intake, and an abrupt drop in milk production. The spread tapered off within 10 to 14 days, and most animals were slowly returned to regular milking after they recovered. But researchers have not yet systematically and repeatedly collected samples from affected animals to understand how much virus they are harboring inside their noses or shedding into milk over the course of their infection. Those are among the types of studies that are urgently needed, Donald Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration, said during an online symposium last week organized by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). “As these animals become infected, what does that profile look like for viral shedding?” Such research would help answer the question of how much H5N1 virus a cow needs to come in contact with to get infected — the so-called “infectious dose.” Right now, that remains unknown, Prater said. Can cows be infected but not show symptoms? Can those cows shed virus in milk or spread virus to other cows? There’s been so little testing going on — and so little disclosed about the numerators and denominators of that testing — that it’s hard to gauge how big an issue asymptomatic infection is and what role, if any, it is playing in transmission within and among herds. But the information USDA released about the virus having been found in the lung of an asymptomatic cow is clear proof that not all infected cows have outward signs of illness. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy Rosemary Sifford, the agency’s chief veterinary officer, said during the ASTHO symposium that little is known about cow-to-cow spread via the respiratory route, but she gave an example of apparent transmission from presymptomatic animals. (A person with flu can be contagious a day before developing symptoms.) Sifford noted that cows in a herd without symptoms tested positive after cattle were moved into it from another herd whose remaining animals then went on to develop symptoms. The positive cows in the second herd haven’t developed symptoms, she said. “We are just getting underway with those studies to give us an idea of the opportunity for viremia either ahead of or after clinical signs,” she said. “So we should have more information about that in the coming weeks.” One such study will be taking place in the high-containment laboratories at Kansas State University’s Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases. Director Jürgen Richt said his group already has the necessary approvals and hopes to begin the research in mid-May. They will be experimentally infecting lactating and non-lactating cows with the version of H5N1 that has been found in cattle herds, both by the oral-nasal route and by directly injecting the virus into udders. The goal: To see where the virus goes in the cows and how they shed it. Is it just found in milk? Or in feces and urine too? Some uninfected cows will be housed with the infected animals to see whether they contract the virus, Richt said. As to whether infected cows that have no symptoms are shedding virus in their milk, the evidence of viral traces in commercially purchased milk brings that question to the forefront. Farmers are supposed to discard milk from infected cows, which reportedly looks odd — yellowish and unusually thick. But PCR testing of commercially sold pasteurized milk has shown a substantial portion of samples were positive for RNA from H5N1, indicating the presence of either viral fragments or dead viruses. (The FDA said last week about one in five samples purchased in a cross-country survey tested positive.) So either some farmers aren’t following the recommendation, or some milk isn’t noticeably altered, or some cows that aren’t known to be sick are shedding the virus in their milk. What is it about milking parlors that allows transmission to occur? Milking parlors are typically enclosed buildings outfitted with individual stalls arranged in a ring or in rows where dairy cows are led two to three times each day to drain their udders of milk. In a milking operation, the stimulus to secrete milk comes not from the sight or touch of a calf but is usually provided by a farm worker. That person also cleans the animal’s teats with a damp cloth and then dips them into a disinfectant solution to protect them from infectious bacteria present on a farm. The teats are then attached to the milking unit, also called a claw, which consists of a cluster of four rubber or silicon-based liners that fit snugly around each teat. The milking lasts about six to nine minutes per animal, and then each cow receives another disinfectant treatment before it’s ushered out and another animal is brought in. Related: Cattle testing for H5N1 bird flu will be more limited than USDA initially announced The problem is that the milking equipment that comes into contact with the cow’s udders is typically not sanitized between individual animals, said Nigel Cook, a professor in Food Animal Production Medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and long-time dairy cow health researcher. Rather, sanitization steps happen only two or three times a day. “Contamination of the milking unit with milk residue cross-contaminating to the next cow would be a risk — as it would with any mastitis pathogen,” Cook told STAT via email. Liners also have to be regularly replaced, as wear and tear and chemical exposure make them lose their elasticity, becoming rough and split. When that happens, the liners are more difficult to disinfect and can act as a reservoir for infection. Liners, dip cups, washrags, and milkers’ gloved hands are all possible means of spreading the virus from one animal to the next. Washrags used on different animals are often laundered together before repeat use, but some dairies don’t use hot water, and researchers have found genetic traces of H5N1 on both used and clean rags using PCR testing. More work is needed to figure out which vectors are playing the biggest role, scientists told STAT. Kuiken is a bit pessimistic about whether, once the virus has found its way into a herd, transmission can be stopped: “You can’t not milk. And you probably can’t milk so well as to prevent cow-to-cow spread. I don’t think you can do it.” What puts people working on dairy farms at highest risk? Only one human infection — a Texas dairy farm worker who developed conjunctivitis — has been reported, but anecdotal reports abound of other farm workers with conjunctivitis and mild respiratory symptoms. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working to figure out where the biggest risks to these workers lie, Sonja Olsen, associate director for preparedness and response in CDC’s influenza division, said during the ASTHO symposium. Is it exposure to cows? Contact with milk? Are there specific activities on farms or in slaughterhouses that put people at elevated risk of contracting H5N1? The CDC recommends that people working with or around cattle suspected or confirmed to be infected with H5N1 wear gloves, disposable fluid-resistant coveralls, vented safety goggles or a face shield, and an N95 respirator. Related: Washington kicks into gear on H5N1 Kuiken said the setup of many milking parlors is almost tailor-made to put workers in contact with viruses being shed in milk. That’s because there is typically a well — think of the area under the hoist in the garage where your car gets repaired — where workers are located while cows are being milked. “So the milk worker is standing in a depressed area, and therefore his eyes are about at knee level — a little bit higher, maybe — with the cow. So very good for being inoculated, for eye infection,” he said. “They can milk the cow beforehand just a little bit, and the spray of milk will come out of the teat. That’s one way of getting infected. Taking off or putting on the teat cups is one way. The cows are defecating and urinating during the milking process, or afterwards. They clean the [milking parlor] using a high-pressure hose. So there are all different ways in which these milk workers can easily become infected.” Cook is also concerned about the possibility that the high pressure hoses that are used to spray down the parlors after milking may be aerosolizing virus that has fallen to the floor, making it easier for cows — and humans —to breathe in. He and other colleagues at the University of Wisconsin have begun deploying air monitoring devices into the milking parlors of affected farms to investigate the extent to which they can find genetic evidence of the virus in the air. If so many dairy farm workers have been and are being exposed to H5N1, why has only one human infection been confirmed? Is that plausible? Not likely. Farmers, who mostly haven’t been willing to have their cows tested, haven’t been keen to have their workers tested either. The CDC’s Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, admitted as much last week. “These situations are challenging. There may be owners that are reluctant to work with public health to say nothing of individual workers who may be reluctant to sit down with somebody who identifies themself as being from the government in some way.” There have been reports that some farms may employ undocumented workers. Related: Genetic analysis reveals H5N1 flu virus outbreak in cows likely started earlier than thought Dairy farm workers presenting with milder signs of illness, like conjunctivitis, also would make cases harder to spot. If only conjunctivitis is occurring, though, that presents another potential clue that people aren’t currently getting sick by breathing in H5N1, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who studies emerging zoonotic pathogens at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. In the rare cases where people have contracted H5N1 from birds — mostly poultry farm workers and people with small backyard flocks — infections have resulted from close contact or exposure to aerosolized poultry waste. Since 2003, there have been 889 confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1; of those 52% were fatal. “It’s entirely possible that there have been a lot of human cases from cows and people are just getting it in a different way,” Rasmussen said. “What that says about the risks to farm workers and dairy processing staff on a given farm or milking parlor is really unclear to me and it’s also something we need to urgently catch up on.” Should more be done to find infected people? The World Health Organization appears to be concerned about the possibility of undetected human cases. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the department of epidemic and pandemic preparedness, told STAT she’d like to see, among other things, studies looking for antibodies to H5N1 in the blood of farm workers and people who’ve been in contact with farm workers, to determine if there have been unreported cases and possibly even spread from those individuals to others. “For every human case of avian influenza since its emergence in 1996, 1997, there has always been … active case-finding, extensive testing, serologic surveys around humans. And we would certainly want to see that in any country, including in the U.S.,” said Van Kerkhove. “I’ve heard and read quite a bit about some potential additional cases. We’ve heard maybe conjunctivitis or whatnot. But I think what’s really critical now is to understand the extent of infection in humans.” “The more we look, potentially the more we can find. And if we’re not looking, then we’re perhaps missing something that could be quite significant.” Could people become infected by drinking milk containing H5N1 viruses? Research is still being done to determine if all pasteurization techniques — there are multiple approaches — inactivate the virus. But the findings so far are reassuring. Scientists at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., have reported that while they could find genetic evidence of the virus in milk bought in stores, they could not grow live viruses from that milk, suggesting pasteurization kills H5N1. But given the concentration of virus that researchers are seeing in milk from infected cows, they believe that raw milk — milk that has not been pasteurized — is an entirely different story. Because so little testing has been reported, it’s really not known how many herds in how many parts of the country have been or are currently infected with H5N1. The USDA has reported 34 outbreaks in nine states since late March. It has not disclosed whether any of those dairy farms sold raw milk. Nor is it known if any raw milk producers have had bird flu infections in their cows. If cows that produce milk destined for the raw milk market got infected with H5N1, people who consume that milk could drink a large dose of the virus, scientists say. Kuiken said he’s heard of concentrations that would be the equivalent of a billion virus particles per milliliter of milk. He told STAT he thought authorities should ban raw milk sales while the outbreak is underway.",STAT,yes,yes,"The article mentions a 52% fatality rate for human H5N1 infections since 2003, indicating a high mortality rate. It also provides nuances by discussing the possibility of undetected human cases and the potential for different transmission routes, suggesting that the reported rate might not fully capture the situation.","You can imagine that if such a cow is milked in a milking stall, even a few drops of milk remaining on the teat cup which is used to milk will then subsequently contaminate the teat of the next cow.

Four reasons to be concerned (but not freak out) about the bird flu,1714521600000,"Even as several federal agencies scheduled a Wednesday news conference to explain steps being taken to monitor and contain bird flu in the U.S., public health officials this week said even more vigilance is needed.

Now is the time to get ahead of bird flu, a handful of experts said, so we don't end up with another nightmare scenario.

""Every moment we're not preparing for it, is a failure on our part,"" said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease specialist and founding director of Boston University's Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases. ""It is always later than we think it is in an outbreak.""

Bird flu is the nonscientific name for avian influenza, a type of flu virus that commonly infects waterfowl, turkeys and other birds. If it stays in birds, the main danger is to poultry. Flocks of chickens have had to be killed and eggs destroyed.

The larger concern is that it might evolve to become easily transmitted person-to-person. Bird flu is considered more dangerous than the annual flu because it's a strain humans have never encountered and it's likely to be highly contagious.

This probably hasn't happened yet, experts say.

""There's no current evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission,"" said Dr. Raj Panjabi, a part-time faculty member at Harvard Medical School and the former White House senior director for global health security and biodefense on the United States National Security Council.

""It's the moment to get ready to step up investments in public health, especially around prevention, protection and preparedness,"" Panjabi said.

Federal officials Wednesday said the latest round of testing proves the commercial milk supply is safe, as are products like cottage cheese and sour cream that are made from milk. They continue to test people who work on farms and only one person is known to have caught the virus in recent months. Vaccines and antivirals should be available if bird flu becomes transmissible from person to person.

But public health officials say they suspect more people have caught the virus from animals than we're aware of, and the chance of a bird flu pandemic cannot be ruled out.

Bhadelia said the absence of more human infections so far may reflect a lack of testing rather than a lack of actual infections.

""If I were a betting person, I would say there have probably been more human infections than what we've detected already in this country,"" she said. ""I would bet part of my retirement on that.""

In interviews this week, she and other leading epidemiologists, infectious disease, public policy and dairy industry experts, outlined four major concerns about bird flu, and one area where they feel mostly reassured:

It's called 'bird flu' but it's now in cows and other animals

What makes the outbreak so concerning is that the bird flu virus already has jumped from birds to other animals, including cows.

This form of avian influenza, a strain called H5N1, has been around since at least 1997, but it mutated a few years ago to become adaptable to more kinds of bird species as well as to mammals. Since then, it's been found in a range of animals, including a bottlenose dolphin off the coast of Florida in March 2022 and 29 house cats in Poland in June 2023.

But finding it on American cattle farms in early February was still a surprise, said Gerry Parker, associate dean for Global One Health at the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University. Cows are not considered especially vulnerable to flu.

A virus that can thrive in a range of mammals might thrive in humans.

""The probability is going up that we might get a genetic reassortment that could turn this into a human virus,"" Parker said. ""We don't know that, but as this continues to circulate into more mammalian species, the likelihood just increases. It may never happen but if it did, it could easily become a potential pandemic threat.""

Do we really know where it's spread?

Bird flu initially struck a single dairy farm in the Texas panhandle and spread to other dairy farms from there, Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer with the Department of Agriculture, told reporters Wednesday.

But it's still not clear exactly where the flu virus has spread or what it's capable of, said several experts, including Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health.

""Our surveillance is inadequate to know where this virus is and where it isn't, which is critical for protecting farmworkers and people involved in the dairy industry -ut also important for staying ahead of this virus to prevent a future pandemic,"" Nuzzo said.

About 100 people working on dairy and cattle farms have been tested for active infections. Nuzzo and others said testing should be more widespread and should also include tests to see whether some had already recovered from infections.

""If there are a lot more people infected who aren't sick enough to go to the hospital, that would be important to know,"" Nuzzo said. ""We have to have a much stronger conversation about how to improve our surveillance.""

It's also unclear exactly how this virus is being transmitted among animals, which is crucial information for slowing or stopping the spread and protecting people working on farms.

Although flu is typically a respiratory virus passed through the air and by touching contaminated surfaces, it has behaved differently among cows; at least some of the transmission appears to be through unpasteurized milk. Farm cats have contracted the virus, potentially by drinking this milk.

""We think milk is the primary vector for movement (of the virus),"" Sifford told reporters.

Milking equipment is cleaned but not sterilized between cows, Parker said, so the virus may be transmitted when one cow with the virus in her milk leaves some of it on the machine to be picked up by the next cow's udder.

The cows also passed it back to birds. Eight poultry flocks located near infected dairy herds contracted the virus after the cows did, though how they got it remains unclear.

No one knows how sick a person might get if they catch H5N1.

Birds often die; most cows, so far, have recovered from their infections, said Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation.

The one farmworker in Texas who caught bird flu only suffered from an eye infection and apparently recovered fully. Bhadelia speculated he might have caught it by touching his eye after touching contaminated milking equipment, which is why the infection was focused on his eye.

Since 1997, about half the people hospitalized globally with bird flu have died. But Bhadelia said many more might have caught the virus from direct interactions with infected birds and never showed symptoms or were so mildly ill that they never required treatment -o the actual death rate is unknown. Plus, if the virus did adapt to become transmissible in people, it might become milder, though we can't count on that, she said.

In any kind of emerging crisis, there's never enough data, Parker said. ""I call it the fog of war,"" he said.

Workers may not be adequately protected

Although the average American is not at risk right from bird flu, farmworkers, especially those working around poultry and cattle, probably are.

""We've been so fixated on, 'Is this going to become a pandemic?' and not enough on 'There's a threat on our farms today,'"" Nuzzo said. ""We should not wait for a severe illness in order to protect farmworkers.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended dairy workers and people who come onto dairy farms use eye protection, wash their hands frequently and wear things like disposable coveralls if they travel from farm to farm, so as not to carry the virus with them, Jonker noted.

In addition to the basic worries about worker health, the more workers become infected, the greater the risk one of them won't be able to clear the virus quickly. Viruses evolve as they pass from person to person but also within a single person, especially if they don't shake it off quickly, Bhadelia said.

""The more people it infects, and the longer it adapts to the human body,"" she said, the more likely the virus will become contagious -nd dangerous -o other people.

Yes, there are vaccines and antivirals, but...

Unfortunately, even people who've gotten annual flu shots or caught the flu recently won't have any protection against the H5N1 strain, said Lawrence Gostin, a leader in global health at Georgetown University, where he is faculty director of the O�eill Institute for National and Global Health Law.

The federal government has flu vaccine and antiviral stockpiles that theoretically could be useful if H5N1 becomes easily transmissible among people.

But public health experts say the reality is much more complicated.

There won't be enough for everyone and the vaccine that's been stockpiled hasn't been tested to prove it can effectively prevent infection or severe disease.

""I don't know that anyone has a vaccine that's been tested thoroughly that anyone would be really confident about its effectiveness,"" said Dr. Jeremy Luban, a professor at the UMass Chan Medical School and member of the executive committee of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness. ""Part of the problem is we don't actually know what that virus is until it appears.""

Two companies are testing a candidate vaccine in early trials, David Boucher , a top official within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, said at the news conference. If the virus moves from animals into people, it will continue to mutate, so existing vaccines might not be effective and it's challenging to develop and test a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist, Luban said. Such testing would take time and the flu virus, which mutates much faster than the virus that causes COVID-19, would continue to transform. Antivirals, like Tamiflu, are likely to be effective against bird flu, federal officials say. But they need to be taken within the first day or two after infection starts, at a time when most people aren't even sure whether they are sick and well before they have time to make a doctor's appointment and get and fulfill a prescription for an antiviral. But the food supply is almost certainly safe. Both public health and federal officials reassured the public about the safety of the commercial food supply. Concerns about bird flu passing through milk is another reason people should avoid drinking unpasteurized milk, Nuzzo said. 'There are a lot of reasons not to drink raw milk,' she said. 'We just added a new one.' The point of pasteurization is to kill pathogens. The Food and Drug Administration has tested 297 commercial samples that had evidence of the H5N1 virus, including 96 milk samples and another 200 products made with milk, like cottage cheese and sour cream. In all cases, the virus had been killed by pasteurization and posed no health risk, said Dr. Donald A. Prater, the FDA's acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The agency also tested infant and toddler formula and found no viral particles at all, Prater told reporters. Surveillance on poultry farms is more extensive than on cattle farms because bird flu has been seen in birds for much longer, Jonker and others said. At the first sign of infection on an egg or chicken farm, animals are 'culled,' a polite way of saying 'killed' and their eggs destroyed. The government long ago set aside funds to compensate farmers for having to take such drastic actions, he said. The meat supply is almost certainly safe, Emilio Esteban USDA's Under Secretary for Food Safety, told reporters. He said animals are inspected before slaughter and carcasses must pass inspection after slaughter. 'We are confident the meat supply is safe,' he said. For extra security, his department is now running tests on retail samples of ground beef purchased from states where dairy herds have been affected by bird flu, along with muscle from cows killed after being infected with bird flu and from beef patties cooked at three different temperatures to document that cooking kills any virus that might remain in the meat. 'We are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe,' he said. 'We are doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure we have additional data points. Sample ready for testing. On April 19, 2022, New York, USA, NYC high school students who work in a virology lab at Mount Sinai collected bird droppings in Central Park.

"Texas dairy farm worker� case may be first where bird flu virus spread from mammal to human, scientists say",1714694400000,"A new report on the first human bird flu case tied to the outbreak in cows in the United States suggests that the Texas man may be the first detected case of the H5N1 virus transmitting from a mammal to a person. Nearly 900 people in 23 countries have been infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus since it started spreading from Southeast Asia in late 2003. But previous human cases were all linked to transmission from infected birds, typically domestic poultry. The report, published Friday by the New England Journal of Medicine, details the unidentified man’s symptoms and his possible route of infection. It was written by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Texas Department of State Health Services, and the Texas Tech University Bioterrorism Response Laboratory in Lubbock. How the man became infected cannot be proven; while the cattle on the farm where he worked reportedly suffered from a decline in milk and other symptoms seen in herds that have tested positive for H5N1, no animal testing at that farm was undertaken. The authors noted, though, that nearby farms where dairy cows experienced the same symptoms tested positive for the virus. Related: Bird flu virus circulated in cows for four months before outbreak confirmed by USDA, analysis shows “Given the infected human was a dairy farm worker with reported exposure to sick, presumably infected cows in Texas and without reported exposure to other mammals or birds, we believe the genetic and epidemiologic data are strong evidence of infection of the human following exposure to presumably HPAI A(H5N1) virus-infected cows,” they wrote in the supplementary materials that accompanied their report. HPAI A(H5N1) is scientific shorthand for highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of the H5N1 subtype. The term “highly pathogenic” applies only to how the virus behaves when it infects poultry, though people might easily assume it applies more broadly, given how deadly this virus has proven to be over the decades. Roughly half of the people known to have been infected died. It kills wild birds and dozens of mammalian species, including cats (domestic and large cats), seals, foxes, mink, and many other scavenging carnivores that have had the misfortune of consuming infected wild birds. In the report the authors describe, the man’s illness was exceedingly mild. His lungs were clear and he had no trouble breathing; he had no fever. His sole symptom appeared to be conjunctivitis, a condition colloquially known as pink eye. The man and people he lived with were given flu antiviral drugs. He reported that his conjunctivitis cleared up. None of the people he lived with became sick. Ideally in cases like this, scientists would draw blood from the man and his contacts, as well as from other people working on the farm, to look for antibodies to the H5N1 virus. Presence of antibodies among other farm workers might suggest the virus is passing to people more commonly than has been seen. Antibodies in the blood of the man’s contacts could indicate that he transmitted the infection to them, but that their cases were so mild they didn’t have symptoms. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy But this work was not done, the report said, because the man and his contacts would not agree to have blood drawn. “We were also unable to collect acute or convalescent sera to assess seroconversion in the dairy farm worker or household contacts,” they said. Likewise it appears that health authorities were not allowed on the farm to investigate whether more workers might have been infected. The authors report that nasal swabs taken from the man also showed presence of virus, but at much lower levels than what was found in his conjunctiva, the tissue surrounding the eye. They hypothesize that the man could have been infected by one of two routes. Either virus in the air in the milking parlor landed in his eyes — reportedly he did not wear eye protection — or he may have had virus on his hands or gloves and transferred it to his eye inadvertently, they suggested. Analysis of the genetic sequence of the virus retrieved from this man has shown that while it is closely related to the viruses that have been causing the cow outbreaks, it does not fit neatly into the viral family tree that scientists studying the sequences have developed. The authors suggested that it’s possible the virus was from a slightly different offshoot that has died off; alternatively, there could have been more than one spillover event from birds in the Texas panhandle region where these outbreaks were first observed. Related: Tracking bird flu virus changes in cows is stymied by missing data, scientists say To date, 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus, though it is believed that many more have experienced outbreaks but have not been tested. Both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC have acknowledged that farmers have often refused to cooperate with their efforts to investigate these outbreaks. The report noted that the virus from the man was closely related, genetically, to the viruses used to produce two batches of H5N1 vaccine that the U.S. government has made and stockpiled as a hedge against a bird flu pandemic.

"Texas farmer diagnosed with bird flu from cow had intense eye bleeding, gross new photo shows",1714780800000,"A dairy worker in Texas who was diagnosed with bird flu experienced painful bleeding in both of his eyes, a disturbing new image of the patient shows, and fluid oozed from one of them. The farm worker reported eye discomfort and redness late last month after coming into contact with sick cattle. The livestock exhibited similar symptoms to cows in northern Texas that were diagnosed with the H5N1 virus, according to a medical report published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The patient was quickly diagnosed with the bird flu strain Type A H5N1, which is spreading rapidly among livestock. Doctors released the first image of a patient diagnosed with bird flu, who experienced hemorrhaging in the eyes. Timothy M. Uyeki et al/New England Journal of Medicine Doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which initially diagnosed the unidentified person, released a photo as part of the report on Friday. It outlined the symptoms and showed the patient's bloodshot eyes severely hemorrhaged. The right eye, which experienced the fluid drainage, was especially red. The worker wore gloves but no face mask or eye protection when he dealt with the animals, according to doctors. The virus appeared to infect only the farmhand's eyes and luckily didn't spread to his lungs. The patient had no changes in vision, fever or other any other symptoms and the fiery pinkeye cleared up within days, according to the report. The first report of a human contracting the bird flu from cows came just a week after dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with the virus. Casa.da.Photo � stock.adobe.com The mild case isn't guaranteed � while some people don't develop any noticeable symptoms, others can come down with severe, life-threatening pneumonia. Around 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization, and some experts fear the real threat would come if there are further mutations. The patient was told to isolate and was treated with an antiviral drug for the flu, according to the CDC. The agency said in a release on April 1 that the threat to the general public remains low despite the infection, but those with close or prolonged exposure to infected birds or other animals are at greater risk. Authorities also insist the nation's meat dairy supply is not at risk. The Texas worker became the second person in the US to contract the virus, according to federal and state officials. Officials say the recent bird flu infection does not mean there is any greater risk to the general public. It was originally detected in Antarctica in October 2023. Chilean Antarctic Institute/AFP via Getty Images The latest diagnosis came a week after dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with the virus. Herds in Michigan, Idaho and New Mexico have since tested positive for bird flu. Thirty-six total dairy herds were affected as of Thursday, according to the CDC. The first human infection was in 2022, when a prison inmate contracted the disease while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Colorado.

WHO� top scientist learned a hard lesson about H5N1 two decades ago: Stopping it takes more than biology,1715040000000,"Jeremy Farrar, now the World Health Organization� chief scientist, was working in Vietnam 20 years ago when the H5N1 virus started to spread across Asia �t that point in poultry. He recalls there was a reluctance among farmers to cull their chickens because they weren� being compensated for them. Movement of infected birds to evade culling only served to disseminate the virus, which in the years since has spread to all continents except Australia.

It� important to keep that experience in mind, he told STAT Monday, as the H5N1 bird flu virus now spreads among dairy cattle in the U.S. Farrar stressed that the social context is key in responding to disease threats like H5N1, noting that a similar reluctance among dairy farmers to report outbreaks or allow testing of their workers is adding to the challenges in assessing how much transmission is occurring and the risk it poses to people. That fits with the description of how this virus is behaving in cows, with clear signs of infection in the udders, but little evidence of respiratory tract infections and no reports to date of cows experiencing neurological symptoms. This virus has been seen to attack the brains of a number of other mammalian species it can infect, including cats, which is why consideration of whether cows’ brains are also susceptible is important. The work was done by scientists at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark’s Statens Serum Institut, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. FURTHER READING Go deeper: H5N1 bird flu in cows The bird flu virus currently poses a low risk to humans, but it still keeps the CDC's top flu expert up at night. Pasteurization inactivates the H5N1 virus in milk. Scientists say raw milk should be especially avoided now that avian flu has been found in cows. Alarm, not harm: Dairy state lawmakers urge restrained approach and government assistance to farmers dealing with avian flu outbreak. Pandemic preparedness experts call for bird flu wastewater surveillance. The distribution of the receptor types — some of which avian flu viruses can attach to, others to which human flu viruses attach — raises concerns that cows could potentially give rise to a version of H5N1 or another novel flu virus that is able to transmit efficiently to and among people, the authors suggested. “These results provide a mechanistic rationale for the high levels of H5N1 virus reported in infected bovine milk and show cattle have the potential to act as a mixing vessel for novel [influenza virus] generation,” they wrote. Pigs, which can be infected with both bird flu and human flu viruses, have traditionally been referred to as mixing vessels for new viruses that could pose a pandemic threat. That’s because when an animal is co-infected with different flu viruses, the pathogens can swap genes, a process called reassortment. That phenomenon could give rise to new virus strains with enough human genes to be able to easily infect people, but also enough bird flu genes to be foreign enough to human immune systems that they could pose a serious risk to human health. Cows have not been thought to pose such a risk. Though it’s known they can be infected with flu viruses, influenza hasn’t been seen to be a major issue for cows. And until this outbreak, cows have not played a role in the H5N1 story. This virus, first seen in China in 1996, is primarily one that infects wild birds and domestic poultry, though it has been shown to be able to infect numerous mammalian species over the nearly three decades that have followed. In that time, nearly 900 human infections have been detected. Of those people, roughly half have died. In the current U.S. outbreak, one human case has been detected, a dairy farm worker in Texas whose sole symptom was conjunctivitis. It’s widely believed there may have been other cases, but farmers have in many cases been unwilling to cooperate with health authorities trying to investigate the outbreak and many of the workers have been wary of cooperating as well. Related: Texas dairy farm worker’s case may be first where bird flu virus spread from mammal to human, scientists say Some scientists not involved in the research described the paper as interesting, but questioned whether one could conclude cows pose a mixing vessel risk based on these findings. Malik Peiris, chair of virology in the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, told STAT in an email that previous research has shown that cows are not highly susceptible to human flu viruses. Furthermore, it would be hard to see how a human flu virus could reach a cow’s udder, which contains receptors for both avian and human flu viruses. “Thus, I do not think the risk of human flu-H5N1 reassortment in cows is likely.” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, Canada, agreed, noting that knowing which tissues a flu virus can attach to only tells part of the story. There are other factors, she said, that determine whether or not a virus can replicate in the cells it attaches to, triggering infection. That said, Rasmussen, who studies animal diseases that can jump into people, is still worried about H5N1 in cows. To date, H5N1 infections have been confirmed in 36 herds in nine states. “I’m more concerned about cow H5 evolving toward human-to-human transmission by jumping between different hosts (bird to cow to human, cow to bird to cat, cow to cat) as well as cow to cow. This selects for viruses that can infect, replicate efficiently, and shed enough to transmit onward in many different hosts, and increases the odds that it could do so in a human one,” she wrote in an email. “These data are confirmation to me that it is essential to get the cow outbreak under control, because there are many possibilities for a more transmissible human virus to emerge from it.” The Danish researchers took samples of stored tissues — brain, respiratory tract, and mammary gland — from a small number of cows and a calf. Some of the cows were dairy cows; others were beef cattle. They stained the tissue to see what receptors they had, whether they were for human or avian flu viruses, and among the latter whether they were the type best adapted for viruses that circulate among chickens or those that circulate in wild ducks. A spillover of virus from wild birds is believed to have started this outbreak in cows. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy They found few receptors in the brain tissue they examined. “What we found was that the influenza receptors were expressed in the neurons, but in a very low amount. So we also speculate that this could be the reason why there have not been found any neurological signs” among infected cattle, said first author Charlotte Kristensen. Kristensen is defending her thesis this week and is set to begin postdoctoral research at the university, in the department of veterinary and animal sciences. A surprising finding was a lack of receptors in the ducts of the mammary glands, which the authors said argues against the notion that cows are becoming infected by what they call an “ascending infection.”  The leading hypothesis for how this infection is spreading among cows is that when an infected cow enters a herd, small amounts of its H5N1-contaminated milk can remain on milking equipment, coming in contact with the teats of uninfected cows, who then become infected. Peiris, while agreeing the receptor pattern in the mammary ducts was surprising, said he still believes this route of infection is most likely, noting that there are reports that some cows only experience infection in some — not all — quarters of their udders. “There is no other way to explain how one segment of the mammary gland is infected while others are unaffected,” Peiris said. Rasmussen agreed. “These results are interesting and good to know. But I don’t think they are sufficient evidence to rule out contaminated milking equipment or any other hypothetical transmission route. Especially respiratory,” she wrote.",STAT,yes,no,"The article reports that nearly 900 human infections have been detected and roughly half have died, indicating a high human mortality rate.

"If many dairy farm workers contract H5N1, we risk a pandemic",1715040000000,"The discovery of bird flu virus particles in milk has moved the federal government to take more aggressive action to prevent the further spread of H5N1 on dairy farms. The Agriculture Department has rightly issued new testing recommendations meant to keep the virus from spreading across state lines. But this additional testing will do little to address the primary threat that H5N1 poses to humans: the infection of farmworkers. Our failure to protect them threatens their health and gives the virus an opportunity to evolve into a greater threat to people, including those who live far from dairy farms.

The discovery of viral material in milk sold in American stores is not in itself alarming. Pasteurization, though it doesn't remove pathogens, destroys their ability to infect people. Follow-up testing has confirmed this: Researchers have not been able to isolate and grow the virus from pasteurized milk.

But H5N1 poses risks to dairy workers, who may be exposed to infected cows and to milk before it is pasteurized. So far, only one dairy worker in the United States is known to have been infected, and fortunately this person experienced only mild eye inflammation. But there are reports that other dairy workers have gotten sick at the same time that cows have. Veterinarian Barb Peterson told Bovine Veterinarian, ""There's been underreporting of the virus. Understandably, there's been a lot of fear. But every dairy that I've worked with has �ith the exception of one �ad sick human beings at the same time they had sick cows.""

These reports are concerning, not because the infections are severe but because any rise in human infections boosts the chances that the virus will find its way to someone who has more medical conditions and may have a worse disease outcome if infected. And H5N1 has not historically been mild in humans. Of the almost 900 known cases of H5N1 infection in humans worldwide, the virus has killed about half.

So it is crucial to protect from exposure farmworkers who are likely to be in contact with infected animals. The eye protection and masks recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should be readily available to all dairy workers. All states have access to this protective equipment, but making sure dairy farms and operations provide it to their workers and normalize its use will take education.

Dairy workers also need H5N1 vaccines; efforts to make them available need to be expedited. And because many farmworkers are immigrants, work is needed to overcome both a widespread lack of health insurance and strong financial and legal disincentives to report infections.

U.S. health officials have said that the virus now showing up on dairy farms is a good match for vaccines under development. But they have not been clear about the status of vaccines in the existing stockpile, or when the Food and Drug Administration might authorize them to be used. As we learned from covid-19, delays in vaccination could lead to unnecessary deaths.

Protecting workers and preventing the next pandemic also require greater virus surveillance on farms and in dairy processing facilities. The USDA's updated requirements, which mandate the testing of lactating cows only when they are about to move to another state, won't protect farmworkers. The tests have to be sent to laboratories, and this delays results that would signal the need to protect people. More widespread testing on dairy farms remains voluntary and limited to animals with symptoms �espite evidence that cows experience asymptomatic infections and that other farm animals also have been infected.

Wider testing of cows is challenging but essential, as is expanded testing of workers in the dairy industry. Everyone working on dairy farms needs immediate access to antiviral medications in case an outbreak occurs. Rapid tests need to be quickly developed so that samples can be analyzed on farms rather than sent away to labs. And it is crucial to regularly sequence virus samples isolated from cows in order to monitor any genetic mutations that could improve the virus's ability to infect humans or to evade antiviral medicines. The USDA has so far been slow to share genetic information on virus samples gathered from infected cows, and this must change immediately.

Preventing farmworker infections and uncontrolled spread in mammals is key to stopping the virus from spreading more easily among humans. This requires active coordination among federal, state, and local agricultural and public health officials.

Bird flu keeps rewriting the textbooks. It� why scientists are unsettled by the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak,1715212800000,"Twenty-seven years ago today, a 3-year-old boy in Hong Kong developed a sore throat, spiked a fever, and started to cough. Six days later, he was hospitalized; six days after that, he died of acute respiratory distress caused by viral pneumonia. Testing showed the toddler, who� had contact with sick chickens before becoming ill, had been infected with H5N1 bird flu.

His death was the first attributed to a bird flu virus, and since then, dozens more young children across a number of countries have died from this virus, H5N1. In fact, in the weeks that followed the boy� death, 17 other children in Hong Kong contracted the virus and five more died. It was a tragedy �nd a profound shock for the scientists who studied influenza. Until 1997, it was thought avian flu viruses didn’t infect people very often, and when they did, at most they caused exceedingly mild disease. That was what was seen when scientists experimentally infected human volunteers with three different bird flu viruses — not H5N1 — about 35 years ago. The Hong Kong outbreak was the first time the H5N1 virus pulled off the unexpected, rewriting the textbooks that sometimes over-confidently stated what the myriad versions of influenza A viruses found in wild birds and other species could and could not do. But it wouldn’t be the last time. In the nearly three decades since, flu scientists have tracked this virus with both vigilance and dread, watching it defy dogma again and again, learning through hard experience that it is a foe not to be underestimated. Related: Large amount of bird flu virus in milk suggests asymptomatic cows are infected with H5N1 Most scientists that STAT has spoken to since the H5N1 outbreak in cattle in the United States was confirmed are unsettled by the notion that the virus is spreading in mammals with which humans have close contact. “That’s a different ball game altogether,” said Malik Peiris, chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health. “That hadn’t happened in Asia all this time.” Nancy Cox, who for years headed the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said this particular lineage of H5N1, a descendent of a virus first spotted in a goose in China’s Guangdong province in 1996, is unlike any other family of flu viruses she recalls. “It seems that these viruses must have some kind of ‘special sauce’ that has allowed them to find ways to persistently spread, evolve, and cause what appear to be increasingly serious problems in both wildlife and domesticated animals,” Cox, who is now retired, told STAT in an email. “There is an element of unexpected robustness and malleability that has surprised even seasoned influenza watchers.” One such observer is Peiris, who has been closely tracking H5N1 since its first known foray into people. A few years later, in December 2002, he was planning to travel home to Sri Lanka for Christmas, as he did every year. Then wild water birds — ducks, egrets, herons, and the like — started dying in two waterfowl reserves in the city. The cause: H5N1. That too was startling. Wild birds had only been seen to be seriously sickened by bird flu viruses once before, in 1961. And ducks, the natural hosts of bird flu viruses, were thought to be more or less impervious to disease caused by them, said Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Flu viruses don’t attack the respiratory tracts of ducks and other wild water birds, as they do in people. In these birds, the viruses infect cells in the gut, passing through them before being excreted in their droppings. The birds don’t get visibly ill, the textbooks said. Until they did. “All these species, they were falling over dead,” Peiris said in a recent interview. “I missed Christmas. … I stayed in Hong Kong and was swabbing birds.” Related: As livestock move around the country, so does H5N1. The U.S. needs real-time tracking of livestock movements Necropsies — the name for an animal autopsy — showed a surprising pattern of disseminated disease atypical of previous observations of bird flu, and dramatically different from what is seen in human flu infection. This unusual finding of H5N1’s ability to spread outside the lungs, to organs like the liver and the brain, has been seen again and again over the intervening years — in laboratory studies of Kuiken conducted in cats and necropsies of foxes, skunks, mink, and other mammals found to have died of H5N1 infection. It was also reported in a human case, a boy from Vietnam who died in 2004. In the spring of 2005, the phenomenon Peiris helped to record in the parks of Hong Kong happened on a much larger scale in a migratory bird reserve in Western China known as Qinghai Lake. Between April and June of that year, there was a large-scale die-off of wild birds there, again traced to H5N1. A little avian flu background is helpful here. Two groups of bird flu viruses — those bearing H5 or H7 hemagglutinin proteins on their exteriors — can transition from being of low pathogenicity to being highly pathogenic when the viruses spread in domestic poultry. (The term highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI, refers to how the virus behaves in poultry.) Seeing highly pathogenic, or high-path, viruses move back into wild birds in a big way raised serious concerns that wild birds could transmit the virus further and faster than was already occurring via the movement of infected poultry across Southeast Asia. “We published on it and we warned — because this is a migrating center — that this could be spreading far and wide,” Peiris said. Some scientists took a more sanguine view, spouting an aphorism that was heard often in 2005: Dead birds don’t fly. Apparently infected birds do, however. “Really, within a year it was in India and Egypt and Africa and Central Asia,” Peiris said. In the nearly two decades since the Qinghai Lake incident, H5N1 viruses have made their way around the globe, even to perhaps the most unlikely spot of all, Antarctica, infecting penguins and other wild birds there. Only Australia and New Zealand have yet to find H5N1 at this point. Another area in which H5 has rewritten the textbooks relates to what Cox referred to, the virus’ astonishing persistence. The former CDC flu director went back through influenza literature — back to reports of “fowl plague,” as avian flu outbreaks in poultry used to be called in the 1800s and early 1900s, before influenza viruses were first identified — to see how long outbreaks lasted. Related: WHO’s top scientist learned a hard lesson about H5N1 two decades ago: Stopping it takes more than biology Once high-path viruses emerged in poultry, the outbreaks they triggered tended to burn themselves out within a few years, especially when infected birds were culled to try to stop spread. But since reemerging in Hong Kong in late 2002, H5N1 has never really gone away. At some points it has been more headline grabbing than others — with the recent discovery that it can infect cows, for instance. (“Who would have thought cows would get infected? And in this way?” Peiris exclaimed.) But it has never disappeared. “I’m not aware of another … avian flu virus that’s been circulating at this global scale for this long,” said Jeremy Farrar, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist. “That’s unprecedented.” Cox agreed. “While it wasn’t exactly scientific dogma that [high-path] avian viruses would eventually burn themselves out or fade away, it was clear from the history of past outbreaks that this is what happened for the majority of our well-documented outbreaks,” she said. Initially H5N1 was a problem in Southeast and then South Asia, later moving into the Nile River Delta of Egypt and Turkey, then into Europe. But for more than a decade, this highly problematic virus was not found in the Americas, which seemed to support another piece of flu dogma: Flu viruses found in birds that traveled in the migratory flyways that spanned Eurasia did not make their way to the flyways of the Americas. The oft-repeated claim was that the routes flown by migratory birds would keep H5 from crossing to the New World. “Pretty sure I might have said something similar,” admitted Richard Webby, director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals, at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Related: CDC’s top flu scientist says the risk to the public from H5N1 is low, but she isn’t sleeping well. Here’s why And then, that “never the twain shall meet” situation turned out to be wishful thinking. In late 2014 and early 2015, H5N2 and H5N8 viruses — equally dangerous half siblings of H5N1 from Asia, bearing the same H5 hemagglutinin — were found in poultry operations in multiple U.S. states. And then in late 2021, H5N1 itself was found in poultry and wild birds in Newfoundland, Canada’s easternmost province. So much for the non-intersection of the flyways. “By and large, that’s true — the gene pools in migratory birds are distinct,” Peiris said. “But looking back, there were some clues of the mixture of viruses at the individual gene level, that reassortment was occasionally taking place.” (Reassortment is a process by which different flu viruses swap genes within a host, creating hybrids, like H5N2 or H5N8.) From eastern Canada, H5N1 has worked its way through the Americas, infecting two men in the United States, a young girl in Ecuador and a man in Chile in the past couple of years. It has also ignited large poultry outbreaks, and infected and killed an astonishing array of mammals — seals and sea lions, various types of bears, coyotes, bobcats, mountain lions, raccoons, and otters among them. Some of these species have previously been seen to be susceptible to influenza, such as seals. But the scale of the toll the virus is taking on wildlife is unlike anything previously attributed to an influenza virus. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy It’s believed H5N1 may be spreading mammal to mammal in some of the marine species, though this is hard to prove, Kuiken said. It’s clear that it is moving cow-to-cow in the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak — likely with human help. The dairy cow outbreak has uncovered a fact that had been seen before but not widely noted — mammary glands are susceptible to flu viruses. The previous such observation occurred in relation to the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, when some infected women complained of mastitis. Canadian scientists infected ferret pups with H1N1 and allowed them to nurse; their mothers developed infection in their mammary glands. It is not knowable whether H5N1 will ever acquire the capacity to easily infect people and spread person-to-person — in other words, trigger a pandemic. But ongoing transmission in a mammalian species gives the virus a chance to adapt to hosts that are far closer, genetically, to humans than are ducks or chickens. No one who has watched this virus thinks letting H5 get seeded into cow populations is a good idea. Adding to the complexity of this situation is that unlike its behavior in other species it infects, H5N1 isn’t making cows seriously ill. It makes the virus harder to track, and gives farmers less impetus to cooperate with authorities trying to determine how far the virus has spread. “The latest curveball with [high-path] H5 infection in dairy cattle is very concerning because there is little incentive to test dairy cows or their human contacts,” Cox said. “One can see so many potential problems on dairy farms. There are the asymptomatic infections in cows and perhaps people. There are the cows, the dogs, and the cats, and the other farm animals including perhaps pigs, the farm workers, and the family members and so on. It is going to be very challenging to get a clear picture of what is actually happening in anything like real time.” In the nearly three decades of human interaction with H5N1, the virus has taught us a lot about influenza viruses, consigning many things that were previously considered flu facts to the scientific trash bin. Kuiken said in the early 2000s he would give talks about H5N1 with the title “Breaking Rules.” He eventually stopped, he said, “because this lineage broke so many.” All those information resets should have taught us an important and overarching lesson, flu experts say. We should never assume we know everything this virus can do. “We absolutely should be hoping for the best, but planning for the possibility that this is going to be able to transmit human to human, and has the potential of becoming a pandemic virus,” said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Arizona who has been working with an international team of scientists to try to figure out when the cow outbreak started. “It’s much too early to sit back and say, ‘Well, it hasn’t happened yet, so it’s not going to happen.’”",STAT,yes,no,"The article mentions that dozens of young children across a number of countries have died from the H5N1 virus, and in a specific outbreak in Hong Kong, 17 children contracted the virus and five died.

�he issue is when to pull the trigger� how prepared are we for human bird flu ?,1715299200000,"The H5N1 virus has been devastating bird populations, and is now infecting mammals too. Is human-to-human transmission next? And are we ready for another pandemic?

Over the past four years, a silent pandemic has been raging. One in which the death toll is believed to number in the hundreds of millions, but which has received remarkably little attention until now.

The pandemic in question is bird flu, the H5N1 strain of influenza, which since 2020 has moved far beyond the avian world and into mammals ranging from dairy cattle to domestic pets, and species that live on our doorsteps, such as foxes. The virus� presence has been detected on every continent, even Antarctica. While it has yet to evolve the capability of spreading between humans, alarm bells were raised last month after a dairy farm worker in Texas contracted H5N1, seemingly from cattle.

It would appear to be the first known case of bird flu jumping to humans from another mammal. �here is increasing concern at the scientific and public health levels,�ays Dr Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic� vaccine research group, who has previously compared the rising infection rates among animals to �he rumbles prior to an earthquake�

It is clear that a couple of years ago, the current strain of bird flu changed to become supercharged

While H5N1 is well known for its devastating impact on wild bird populations and poultry farms in the US �s of 5 May, 91m farmed birds have been infected in the US across 48 states �oland has been particularly alarmed by reports of pet cats contracting the virus from cattle and becoming seriously ill or dying. �e have very little research to tell us how this is all occurring in cattle, and how it is being spread,�e says.

In the UK, the virologist Prof Paul Digard and his team at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh were awarded an additional �.3m grant last year to ramp up their research into bird flu, and assess the risk the current strain of H5N1 might pose to humans.

�lu is constantly evolving, and it is clear that a couple of years ago, the current strain of bird flu changed to become supercharged,�ays Digard. �ow that it seems to be fairly widespread in the cow population in the US, that� a much more direct route where it could transmit to people and gain the adaptations it needs to go pandemic.�

The Roslin team� task is to figure out the precise changes in the viral sequence that seem to be allowing it to infect cows, and then test the strain on human cells and mini-organs in the lab. The ultimate goal will be to make predictions about whether it is starting to become more dangerous to humans and to animals that live in close proximity to us, and to feed that information back to the relevant public health authorities.

If the findings spark concern, it could provide the government with more evidence to start bolstering national supplies of flu vaccines. Last year, reports emerged that the UK Health Security Agency had run a procurement exercise to source suitable jabs, while the US has accumulated a national reserve of four types of flu vaccine that could provide some protection against H5N1 in case of any future outbreak. But even this stockpile would not be sufficient for the entire country, and Digard explains that governments face a desperately difficult decision when it comes to balancing the economic cost of vaccines against trying to ensure that they are as ready as possible for an outbreak.

�he issue is trying to decide when to pull the trigger for go,�e says. �ecause if you wait until it� already a pandemic, then you�e playing catchup, and you know that you�e not going to be able to make enough vaccine quickly to protect everybody.�

The vaccine bottleneck

If H5N1 did start spreading among people, the good news is that the world has plenty of recent experience when it comes to rolling out large-scale vaccination programmes. More than 13bn doses of Covid-19 vaccines have now been administered, covering 70% of the world� population, while at the height of the 2009 swine flu outbreak, around 3bn vaccine doses were churned out.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are two candidate vaccines against a related strain of flu viruses that could be shipped within weeks, if necessary. Various manufacturers also have special dispensations from regulators to update their flu vaccines with relevant targets from the H5N1 strain, without needing to seek new licensing.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says its estimates suggest that 4-8bn doses of influenza vaccines could be produced within a year in an H5N1 pandemic. Experts say that would require a significant expansion of the global capacity for making flu vaccines, placed at about 1.2bn doses.

�emember that it takes two doses, three to four weeks apart, to achieve protective immunity,�ays Poland. �ou can quickly do the maths and see where that leaves us.�

While manufacturers have been working on H5N1 vaccines since the mid-2000s, research has always indicated that they pose a much greater technical challenge than the seasonal flu vaccines distributed each year. In particular, the jabs seem to require a far larger dose to generate a sufficient immune response. A dose of the H5N1 vaccine candidate manufactured by the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi is 90 micrograms, six times the size of a typical seasonal flu vaccine. Poland says this would make it far more challenging to produce the jab at the scale required.

The WHO� capacity predictions may be relying on ramping up the production of adjuvanted vaccines. These utilise an additional ingredient, or adjuvant, which is combined with the vaccine to boost the immune response, enabling a far smaller dose, and one that is easier to produce in large quantities. The pharmaceutical company GSK says that its pandemic influenza vaccine Adjupanrix, which uses an adjuvant, has a dose of 3.75 micrograms. �n 2022, we signed a contract with the EU� Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority for the reservation of future production and supply of 85m doses of Adjupanrix,�he company says. �n the event of an influenza pandemic declared by the WHO, this will ensure the ready production and supply of Adjupanrix to 12 EU member states.�

However, speed of production could still prove to be a bottleneck. In the event of an H5N1 pandemic, the WHO estimates that 79% of the vaccines produced would be made using traditional gold-standard technologies, which require incubation in chicken eggs. While a Sanofi spokesperson said that during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, vaccines were produced within three months, egg-based platforms are known to be more time-consuming: the process can take up to six months.

Newer technologies

Instead, messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which proved so invaluable in generating Covid-19 vaccines, could once again be a vital tool, with the platform known to be faster and more efficient than older egg-based technologies. Current clinical trials by both Moderna and GSK and CureVac working in collaboration are testing H5N1 vaccines in people. However, given past difficulties in stimulating sufficient immune responses to H5N1, Digard says there is insufficient data to examine the possible effectiveness of mRNA vaccines.

�t� technology that is potentially applicable to this,�e says. � don� think we have the data yet to say that it works as well.�

Given that H5N1 is still largely confined to the animal population, one idea for reducing transmission and limiting the potential for jumping to humans may be vaccinating poultry and farm animals on a mass scale. However, Karen Grogan, an associate professor at the University of Georgia� Poultry Diagnostic and Research Center, is not convinced this would make a significant difference.

If we divert all the vaccine production into H5N1 jabs, that means we aren� making seasonal flu vaccines

�accination of commercial poultry would not decrease the amount of viable virus in the environment since there is so much being shed by wild birds,�he says. �he spread into dairy cattle is likely linked to wild birds on those dairies. There are no approved H5N1 vaccines for use in farm animals or household pets; those would need to be developed, which is a process that takes around four years.�

If there is an H5N1 pandemic, Poland predicts that healthcare services around the world would have to rely partially on antiviral medication for the first six months of the outbreak, until sufficient vaccine stocks became available to provide full population-level coverage. According to the CDC, analysis of the strains circulating among cows show that the virus should be susceptible to the current range of antivirals that are approved against flu.

But whether it� stockpiling antivirals or instructing pharmaceuticals companies to switch to H5N1 vaccine production, Digard says that governments face a difficult dilemma when it comes to how best to respond to the bird flu threat.

�ll this costs money,�e says. �t� a very delicate juggling act. With vaccines, for example, if we begin diverting all the vaccine production to make H5N1 jabs, that means we don� make the seasonal flu vaccines. So if you start an H5N1 vaccine programme prematurely, you�e disrupted the supply of seasonal flu vaccines which are still needed

Although the prevalence of H5N1 in the wild is worrying, Digard is keen to point out that, while the virus is widely reported as having a fatality rate of 52% in humans, based on 882 cases of infections between January 2003 and December 2023, it does appear to have become much less pathogenic for people in recent years.

�here have been human cases in the UK over the last couple of years, but they�e been really mild and generally asymptomatic,�e says. �� not minimising the risk �f this did go pandemic, even with a very mild virus, people would end up dying because of the sheer numbers who get infected. Even swine flu, which is the mildest flu pandemic we have records for, still killed hundreds of thousands of people. But it wouldn� be a science-fiction style pandemic.�",Guardian,yes,yes,"The article reports a human fatality rate of 52% based on 882 cases from 2003 to 2023.

Bird Flu Is Already Here. Just Look at the Millions Killed.,1715299200000,"We don�t yet know if H5N1 bird flu will spill over from animals to infect a large number of humans. Based on the few cases of transmission so far, the World Health Organization has expressed concerns that infection in humans �an cause severe disease with a high mortality rate.�

But already it has wrought devastation upon so many lives. The deaths of millions of birds and mammals around the globe in the last few years directly and indirectly from this outbreak should be enough to spur urgent action to stop the spread of the virus, as well as remind us of the role humans play in the proliferation of infectious diseases.

It�s my belief that humans have an obligation to the nonhuman life we share this planet with to mitigate the harm we�ve enabled this virus to cause. Our unsustainable activities �factory farming, climate-warming emissions and habitat destruction, to name a few �ave helped turn bird flu from a natural phenomenon into an anthropogenic disaster. But even if you don�t share that conviction, it is still in our best interest to keep this virus from spreading.

Disease has always been part of avian natural history. Wild birds are routinely exposed to mild viruses, but are seldom killed by them. Humans, however, have introduced factors that favor disease: A warming climate can weaken avian immune systems, and infections spread more easily when birds come into more frequent contact while sharing what little habitat remains.

And factory farming makes things even worse. When farm animals are kept in large numbers and close quarters in poultry and dairy farms, viruses can spread and mutate more easily. It�s a human-facilitated training ground for diseases. The progenitor of today�s H5N1 strain, for example, emerged in 1996 when a virus infecting farmed geese in Guangdong Province in southern China spilled back into wild populations.

Maintaining the health of their animal holdings and their businesses �ot to mention the potential risk to farm workers and the ever-present threat of human spillover �equires farmers to act quickly. And when bird flu hits farms, often the only real way to contain it is the precautionary culling of entire flocks, which has resulted in tens of millions of dead hens since 2022. The United States Department of Agriculturerecommends that farms use killing methods that avoid suffering. But as many as 66 million chickens and turkeys have been culled with a technique that animal welfare groups call unnecessarily cruel: ventilation shutdown, which kills over several hours through overheating.

Given the animal suffering at stake, minimizing interactions between wild and captive birds is all the more important in preventing the spread of bird flu in both populations. But it�s a daunting task for the agriculture industry, given how difficult it can be to isolate dense animal populations kept in close quarters. When biosecurity measures at farms fail �r aren�t even properly attempted �ild populations take an extremely hard hit.

Though wild bird deaths are harder to tally than poultry culls, the numbers that we do have are disturbing. The strain of bird flu coursing through North America ignited a season of plague for Atlantic seabirds when it first appeared in late 2021 at a Newfoundland farm. From April to September 2022, bird flu killed about 41,000 wild birds in Canada. At least 17 percent of northwestern Europe�s breeding population of Sandwich terns �over 20,000 birds �ied. And from November 2022 to January 2023, the virus killed thousands of wild Ross� and snow geese in North Dakota, Kansas, Indiana and California.

The overall death toll may lie in the millions, with millions more threatened by potential infection thanks to the long-range migrations of waterfowl.

Under normal circumstances, most bird populations can bounce back from die-offs. But climate-warming human activity could impair future recoveries in North America.

When bird flu caused �unprecedented reproductive failure�t a Newfoundland breeding colony of northern gannets in 2022, it was probably worsened by a marine heat wave that coincided with the outbreak. Heat stress weakens birds�mmune responses, and is likely to become more common as the planet warms. Warmer temperatures can also make recovery from H5N1 more difficult by deepening the effects of decreased food supplies, pollution and habitat loss.

None of this is encouraging for North American birds, which have already lost billions in the last half-century because of habitat loss and other forces. We contributed to the conditions that helped bird flu mutate into a highly pathogenic form. �ow it�s taken off, and it�s totally out of our control,�aid Samantha Gibbs, the lead wildlife veterinarian at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Worse may lie in store. If the virus spreads unencumbered, it could spell further disaster for species like the beloved Atlantic puffin or the regionally endangered roseate tern. Colony-nesting seabirds like these nest in close quarters and in high numbers, reducing predation but magnifying the effects of disease. Recent asymptomatic cases in Ad�ie penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula have spurred fears of outbreaks in tight-knit penguin colonies. The blurring of the lines between the wild and the domestic, as infections spill over and back again, also heightens the threats to livestock �nd humans.

But to fret only about the prospect of human infection betrays an ecological narcissism. We must not ignore the nonhuman suffering for which, through factory farming, anthropogenic climate change and habitat destruction, we are responsible.

While you most likely need not worry about catching bird flu from meat, eggs or dairy, this is as good a time as any to cut down on products that contribute to climate change (like greenhouse gas-intensive beef) or perpetrate cruelty (like eggs from caged chickens). The same factory farms that cause excessive animal suffering can also function as a reservoir for disease.

An enduring commitment to nonhuman life on Earth would bring down the risk of zoonotic disease spreading to humans. But saving the planet for our own benefit is only by degrees less shortsighted than destroying it to our own detriment. As its most influential and destructive denizens, we owe a duty of care to all of nature �ot just its human inhabitants.

A visual guide on avian bird flu outbreak and how it's affecting dairy cows,1715299200000,"The CDC and state health department revealed on Thursday that a farmworker in Michigan has tested positive for bird flu, making this the third human case connected to a dairy epidemic.

Researchers are concerned that the more the bird flu virus �lso known as avian influenza H5N1 �preads among animals, the higher the risk it will jump to people.

The virus has been found throughout Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, several areas in Africa and, most recently, the U.S. This strain of bird flu has been documented since at least the 1990s. A few years ago, however, it underwent a mutation that made it more contagious among a wider range of bird species as well as mammals.

The outbreak is concerning because of the virus' ability to infect other animals, such as cattle. In a recent study, the data shows that the virus can jump back and forth between birds and cows, which may help it spread over large geographic areas.

Here's what we know about the spread of the bird flu virus in the U.S.:

Bird flu virus outbreak in dairy cows

The multi-state outbreak, the first ever seen in cattle, probably began late last year.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have confirmed the safety of milk and milk products after more than 67 dairy cattle herds (as of May 28) in nine states and three men have been confirmed infected in the U.S.

According to the health officials, meat samples from retail locations in states where dairy cows are experiencing avian flu outbreaks are being tested to confirm that raw meat poses no health risk to the public.

Pasteurized dairy is safe

In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said fragments of the virus were found in samples of pasteurized milk.

Cattle apparently can spread H5N1 through their milk. It's not clear whether they can pass it through other routes, but researchers are studying this now.

Later studies confirmed that pasteurization, the process of heating milk to kill pathogens, destroys the H5N1 virus.

So the fragments seen in the milk were not contagious and the milk supply and products made from pasteurized milk are safe, the FDA's Dr. Donald A. Prater said earlier this month. Tests of infant and toddler formula did not find any viral fragments, so these are also safe, he said.

Bird flu's adaptability to spread

There have been three human cases of bird flu in the U.S.: One in 2022 (in a case not connected to the current outbreak) and two in April and May of this year. Each case involved people who work with animals. The more times humans are exposed to the virus, the higher the likelihood that it may mutate to become transmissible among people, leading to an outbreak or even a wider pandemic.

Human cases of avian flu are still very rare, but when they do occur, they can be fatal. There have been reports of 889 cases and 463 influenza-related deaths from 23 different countries worldwide from 2003 and April 1, 2024.

There have been reports of wild bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow, cow-to-poultry, and two cases of cow-to-human transmission. There is no evidence so far of human-to-human transmission.

Where bird flu has been detected in wild animals

Since 2022, several U.S. counties have reported that wild animal species have become infected with the bird flu virus.

The virus has been found in more than 20 wild mammal species, including geese, raccoons, mountain lions and a zoo tiger.

The disease isn't limited to land-dwelling mammals.

According to a study released in April, a dolphin in Florida died in 2022 from bird flu. It is the first case of highly infectious avian influenza in North America to be reported in a cetacean.

Can dogs and cats get bird flu? The short answer: Yes.

Cats are particularly vulnerable because they typically interact with wild birds. In April, three cats were found dead on a Texas dairy farm after drinking unpasteurized milk from infected cows. In 2016, a cat spread the virus to a person in New York City, according to the CDC.

You may want to avoid taking your dog on walks in places that are close to where there are a lot of wild birds or bird droppings, such as lakes or ponds. It's best to limit your pet's exposure to wildlife that may be infected.

What are symptoms to look for in your dog or cat?

* Fever

* Lack of energy

* Red eyes

* Head tilt

* Shortness of breath

Bird flu strain found in US cows flown to UK lab for testing,1715385600000,"Virus sent to high-security facility so that experts can examine the potential risks to people and livestock

Avian flu typically spreads by infecting wild birds and moving along migration routes, but the virus currently running rampant in the US is about to be transported across the Atlantic by plane.

This category A pathogen, which is now spreading among cows in the US, is being sent to a high-security laboratory in the UK so that experts can better understand the potential risks to people and livestock.

�t� due to be shipped any day now,�aid Dr Ashley Banyard, a virologist at the UK� Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) lab in Weybridge, Surrey, last week. � saw the packaging instructions in my email this morning.�t is essential this virus does not escape into the wider environment: globally, H5N1 has killed millions of wild birds and thousands of mammals.

Although avian flu is widespread in the UK, the specific genome being imported for testing is the only one known to infect cattle, and the US is the only place where it has been recorded. �e really want to know if there� something special about this particular genotype that� emerged,�aid Banyard.

It is being shipped in a small amount of liquid within three tubes, with dry ice between layers � bit like a Russian doll. A special courier costs hundreds of pounds to safely transport it door to door.

The virus made headlines in the US in March after it was detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas following widespread reports of a loss of milk production. Since then it has been reported across nine US states, with no sign of slowing. It has also been detected in cats and a human, and is likely to have been spreading for months before it was detected.

�e�e hoping that the American situation will be controlled and be limited further, and then we won� see this virus in cattle going forward, but you just never know with these things,�aid Banyard.

�veryone who works at the Weybridge lab is counter-terrorism checked, and there are multiple levels of locked doors and key cards. I know it sounds kind of James Bondesque but it absolutely isn� �hey�e just laboratories,�e said.

From Spanish mink to polar bears in the Arctic and seals in the Antarctic, a range of mammals have been killed by the virus, generally through eating infected meat.

The US outbreak has sparked alarm because it is the first time bird flu has been detected in a cow, and it is not clear how it got there. The fact the virus can spread in dairy herds has led to �enormous concern �t could spread more easily in people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Its director general said last week the virus does not show signs of having adapted to spread human-to-human.

A pre-peer review paper published this month is the first to argue the virus came into dairy cows via a single introduction from a wild bird, and that it is transmitting cow to cow. It is currently believed that milk is the primary vector (perhaps via milking equipment) and symptoms are mild, including a drop in milk production and loss of appetite.

In the US, dairy cows being moved across states must now be tested for bird flu. Health officials say milk is fine to drink, provided it is pasteurised, a process which is designed to kill bacteria and viruses.

There are concerns cows may have been infected in other countries where testing is not being done, although Banyard is confident it hasn� already happened in the UK. �e�e had more than 380 infected premises across the UK in the past two and a half to three years and have not seen any evidence of these symptoms in cattle,�e said.

Very few livestock animals are brought in from the US, and it is rare for migratory birds to bring bird flu viruses from the US to Europe because it is not a common migration route. In the three years of this H5N1 outbreak, not a single north American strain has been found in Europe. �nd everyone in Europe has been looking,�aid Prof Ian Brown, a virologist from the Pirbright Institute in Surrey.

Brown said it was a surprise to see it crop up in dairy cows ��t shows us it can get into niches you wouldn� expect��ut this marks another chapter in the evolution of H5N1, which has continually surprised researchers with the number of animals it has been able to infect (at least 26 species of mammal have been infected). �hese are the early stages of an epidemiological investigation.�

Scientists need to understand bird flu� potential risks to humans. �ll international eyes are on this,�aid Brown. In order for the virus to start spreading between humans, it would have to make some genetic changes that mean it can replicate in human cells.

Brown said people who work in close contact with dairy cattle should be monitored, as they are the highest risk �ore than 200 people are being monitored in the US. �e have to be watchful. We have to make sure we are on top of tracking this so that if the risk changes for humans we spot it early. That� very important.�

If bird flu did begin to spread between humans, it would be a cause for significant concern because the H5N1 virus has a high mortality rate. From 2003 to 2024, 889 cases were reported in 23 countries, and more than half of those people died, according to WHO. So pre-pandemic vaccines have already been stockpiled.

The virus is already circulating in ways it hasn� before. Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said: �he fact that we�e throwing another animal into the mix could potentially shift it around �t creates another layer of unpredictability.�

It is the first time an influenza A virus has been found in cattle, which could create �hreats to wildlife, and livestock and potentially humans that we have not experienced before�

Monitoring and sharing data �uch as testing the US genome in UK labs �s crucial to keeping on top of any potential outbreak. �e are far away from a human pandemic,�ao said. �ut it does bring things a step closer.�",Guardian,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that more than half of the 889 cases reported from 2003 to 2024 resulted in death.

Opinion: H5N1 doesn�t have to be a repeat of Covid-19�s �public health versus the economy�,1715904000000,"The Biden administration announced new programs on May 10 to incentivize dairy farmers and workers to collaborate with public health efforts to investigate and mitigate the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak among dairy cattle. Farmers and agriculture officials have called such testing �overreach,� telling public health officials to �back off.� But the Biden administration�s new programs are a first step toward creating trust and collaboration between public health and industry. Farms don�t want to be identified as H5N1 hotspots for fear that they might end up with milk or beef they can�t sell. The industry has already suffered a financial blow with affected dairies taking as much as a 20% hit to their income, and U.S. cattle prices are dropping as traders fear the outbreak could hurt demand. The USDA already provides financial assistance to livestock, farmed fish, and honey bee farmers who have suffered losses due to disease, animal attacks, and extreme weather. These same funds will be used to compensate dairy farmers whose cows are infected or need to be taken out of milk production. But to qualify for such compensation, dairy farms will have to agree to participate in enhanced epidemiological surveys and other public health measures. In addition to compensating for lost milk revenue, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will also provide up to $28,000 per farm to support various biosecurity measures, including heat treatment of contaminated milk before disposal, veterinarian costs, shipment of specimen, lab testing, personal protective equipment, and uniform laundering. It’s unclear how the USDA will calculate compensation for lost milk revenue. Dairy farms vary tremendously in size, from under 100 cows to more than 15,000. Compensation proportional to the number of cows on a farm might be more persuasive. Related: Federal officials will fund farms’ protective measures to contain H5N1 bird flu Dairy milk processors and retailers could also be motivated to ensure that the farms from which they source their milk are cooperating with public health officials on surveillance, testing, and mitigation measures. A model for this is the Milk with Dignity program, which focuses on improving working conditions in the dairy industry. Participating dairy farms agree to standards for wages, working hours, housing, and worker health and safety. Independent third-parties verify that the dairy farms are complying with these standards. Participating retailers in turn commit to sourcing milk from dairy farms that participate in the program. Consumers also have a role to play here, by demanding that retailers source their milk from farms that are working with public health authorities. Other forms of industry support may also be needed. If contaminated milking equipment is found to be an important vector for transmission, farmers may need incentives or compensation to purchase more milking equipment and hire more farmworkers to maintain the same throughput while allowing for time to sterilize equipment between milking. Currently, only five minutes is allocated to milk each cow, and they need to be milked two to three times per day. It’s also unclear why an indemnity program didn’t already exist for the dairy industry. Poultry farmers are compensated for poultry they’re forced to cull when H5N1 avian flu is detected on their farms. They are also given incentives to test and detect H5N1 infections quickly to prevent its spread to other farms. They are only compensated for poultry they cull, not those that die from infection. And this program doesn’t account for the costs of restocking, downtime, and the delay until the farm becomes profitable again. These programs, however, have been criticized for subsidizing highly profitable big commercial farms without putting pressure on them to do more to change farming practices that may lead to more infectious disease transmission. This is a moment for the USDA and other public health agencies to step back and take stock of whether other risks may exist across the agriculture industry, what incentives may be needed to encourage cooperation with public health officials in the future, and how the farming industry can be encouraged to mitigate risks now. The CDC will compensate dairy farmworkers $75 for taking part in epidemiologic studies of H5N1 avian influenza, though it’s unlikely that will incentivize many workers to participate. It’s a notoriously exploitive industry. The working conditions on dairy farms are grueling and dangerous. With few Americans willing to take these jobs, most milkers are foreign-born Hispanic workers, many of whom are undocumented and don’t have health insurance. Many speak indigenous languages, not Spanish, much less English, making it even more difficult for them to report health and safety violations and access health care and social services. Many can’t access health facilities because there isn’t good public transportation in rural areas and they can’t get a driver’s license in many states. Related: Bird flu keeps rewriting the textbooks. It’s why scientists are unsettled by the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak The risks of their work are normalized, and many don’t understand that there are ways to reduce and prevent injuries. Despite various chemical and biological risks, including not only H5N1 avian flu, but also exposure to formaldehyde, chlorine, Q fever, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it’s uncommon for dairy workers to wear masks or goggles. And if even if they understand how to report unsafe working and living conditions, dairy workers are excluded from protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Workers who take time off for being sick may be punished with loss of income, housing, and their jobs. And because few have a pathway to legal status in the U.S., the greatest fear for many is being deported. They do not want to come to the attention of any government official. Even the one dairy worker in Texas who was known to have H5N1 avian flu refused follow-up testing, and his close contacts also refused testing. President Biden has used his executive powers to grant work permits to migrants newly arrived in the country, and many farmers support providing work permits to undocumented farmworkers to help address labor shortages. In the absence of legal protections, paid sick leave, and at least temporary legal status in the U.S., it’s unlikely that many dairy farmworkers will be willing to participate in research to protect the American public’s health. Many questions remain. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy The overall risk to farmworkers still isn’t understood. Based on prior human infections, it’s estimated that the mortality rate for H5N1 avian flu among humans may be above 50%. We don’t know what proportion of farmworkers and cattle may already have been infected, and how well prior infection protects against future infection with H5N1 avian flu viruses. We don’t know how the virus may be mutating with each infection and adapting to human hosts or becoming more transmissible, more virulent, or more resistant to existing antivirals. We don’t know if the virus is spreading only through contact with milk, or also through the air. We don’t know if wearing goggles and masks will reduce the risk of H5N1 avian flu infection among dairy farmworkers, or if other measures like better indoor ventilation and air filtration or disinfection of milking equipment might be more effective. One of the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic should have been that controlling an infectious disease isn’t just a question of having diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines. It’s also about creating systems that allow people and industry to do the right thing for their own health and for public health without having to take a hit — whether that is losing revenue or wages, jeopardizing a job, or risking deportation. The H5N1 avian flu outbreak needn’t be a rerun of Covid-19’s “public health versus the economy” battle. There’s a lot at stake for the U.S. and the rest of the world.

The Disease Detectives Trying to Keep the World Safe From Bird Flu,1716163200000,"As Dr. Sreyleak Luch drove to work the morning of Feb. 8, through busy sunbaked streets in Cambodia� Mekong river delta, she played the overnight voice messages from her team. The condition of a 9-year-old boy she had been caring for had deteriorated sharply, and he had been intubated, one doctor reported. What, she wondered, could make the child so sick, so fast? �nd then I just thought: H5N1,�he recalled. �t could be bird flu.� When she arrived at the airy yellow children� ward at the provincial hospital in Kratie, she immediately asked the child� father if the family had had contact with any sick or dead poultry. He admitted that their rooster had been found dead a few days before and that the family had eaten it. Dr. Luch told her colleagues her theory. Their responses ranged from dubious to incredulous: A human case of avian influenza had never been reported in their part of eastern Cambodia. They warned her that if she set off the bird flu warning system, many senior government officials might get involved. She risked looking foolish, or worse. Anxious but increasingly certain, Dr. Luch phoned the local public health department, located just across the street. Within minutes, a team arrived to collect a sample from the child, Virun Roeurn, for testing in a lab. By then, Virun� distraught parents had lost faith in the hospital. They demanded that he be sent by ambulance to the capital, Phnom Penh. His flu swab sample traveled with him. Virun died on the journey. At 8 p.m., Cambodia� National Public Health Laboratory confirmed Dr. Luch� suspicion: He had died of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Dr. Luch berated herself for not having thought to test the boy a day earlier, when she might have saved him if she had treated him for influenza. But the alarm she raised and the urgent activity that followed was testament to the strength of Cambodia� disease tracking system and to its importance to the global biosurveillance system. It is the fruit of years of international and local investment, training and public education. It shows how frontline work in low-income countries is increasingly vital to a global system to detect zoonotic diseases �athogens that jump between animals and humans, the way Covid-19 did. The goal is to identify and contain them, buying time to produce enough vaccines or drugs to treat them, or to embark on a frantic mission to develop something new. A growing threat H5N1 is one of many viruses that cause influenza in birds. It emerged in Hong Kong in 1996 and has since evolved into versions that have caused outbreaks in wild and farmed birds and have occasionally jumped to humans. In 2020, a new, especially deadly one caught the attention of scientists as it spread along migratory routes to parts of Africa, Asia and Europe. By 2022, it had reached North and South America and was killing wild and domestic animals, including livestock and marine mammals. So scientists were alarmed when, in February 2023, Cambodia reported two people who had been infected with H5N1. Was this the new version of the virus, returned to Asia and killing people? There had been no such human cases in the country for nearly a decade, though scientists had found that the virus had been present in birds all those years. Genetic analysis established that the virus infecting Cambodians was the familiar subtype, not the one in the Americas � relief. Still, in the past year, Cambodia has reported 11 people infected with bird flu, and five of them have died, more than anywhere in the world. Global anxiety about H5N1 has risen higher in recent weeks, since the virus was detected in goats and dairy cows in the United States, and then in a Texas farmworker who fell ill. As the virus moves between species, scientists fear the potential of the virus to evolve to spread easily not just from birds to mammals, but from person to person. And so the death of 9-year-old Virun, in a provincial Cambodian town, jolted the global system to attention. At first light the day after Virun died, a team from the health department in Kratie arrived at the wooden house on stilts where he had lived. They swabbed everyone in the household and in neighboring homes to test for flu and then went on to Virun� school to test his classmates. At the hospital, and in other medical facilities around Kratie, any patient with a fever was screened. A team from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forests rounded up the family� half-dozen surviving chickens and those of their neighbors and took the birds away to be killed and burned. The team went door to door through the community, asking everyone about illness in their chicken and ducks. Workers from the Ministry of Environment checked rice paddies and forested areas, looking for die-offs in wild birds; they did not find any. In Phnom Penh, the national laboratory sent Virun� sample down the road to the Institut Pasteur, the Cambodian outpost of a global network of public health research centers that date from the French colonial era. There, virologists confirmed the H5N1 diagnosis and compared the sample with a decade� worth of influenza samples in the institute� biobank. They confirmed it was the familiar subtype of the virus. Twenty-four hours after Virun died, the Pasteur lab uploaded genomic sequencing of the virus that had killed him to databases accessible to scientists worldwide. It notified the World Health Organization, which sent out a global alert about a fatal human H5N1 case. Back in Kratie, there was a new concern: Contact tracing had located another case, Virun� older brother, Virak, 16. He had few symptoms, but spent four days in isolation in the hospital, treated with Tamiflu, until he tested negative. With the genetic sequences in hand, and after more gentle conversations with Virun� shattered family, the disease detectives felt confident that Virak had been infected by the same dead rooster as Virun �nd not by Virun himself. That meant Virun� death was a chance misfortune, not the beginning of a global catastrophe of sustained human-to-human transmission. �ext me!� The effectiveness of Cambodia� surveillance system can be credited in part to one man, Dr. Ly Sovann, a kinetic, apparently unsleeping tropical medicine specialist who runs the Cambodian Center for Disease Control. � have two phones, four SIM cards, so I never lose the network anywhere in the country, and people can always reach me,�r. Sovann said, brandishing a cellphone in each hand to demonstrate. � tell everyone: Text me! Don� call me! Too many calls! But text me. You see something, you see an unusual respiratory disease, you see a cluster of diarrhea cases �ou text me. Because one, two hours, one day, it can make a big difference.� His intensity stems from tragedy. Twenty-five years ago, as a young public health official, Dr. Sovann responded to a rural cholera outbreak. Dozens of people had died before the national health ministry even heard about it. When he took charge of the agency, he abolished the slow, bureaucratic system that required provincial-level authorization to send samples to the capital for testing. He created a national hotline that villagers can call toll free to report a sick or dead animal. He told private clinics and hospitals that the national lab would test their suspicious samples for free. His office issues a news release within hours of a confirmed case of human H5N1 or any other infectious threat. His openness discomfits some in the hierarchy, his colleagues acknowledge privately. Avian influenza reporting, for example, can hurt the livestock industry �oultry prices crash each time there is a human case. Dr. Sovann brushes off the concern. �o you imagine that if Cambodia has many, do you think neighboring countries don� have a case?�e said. � say, No. Now if we can detect, it means we�e good. It means our surveillance system is working. If you don� detect, it means you don� know.� But the climate for free exchange of information in Cambodia is deteriorating. The increasingly autocratic government has shuttered independent news organizations. For now, Dr. Sovann still operates with a degree of independence. International organizations supporting disease surveillance here walk a delicate diplomatic line, seeking to keep the information channels open. Protecting the international network is critical. The collaboration grew out of a deadly bird flu outbreak that began in Hong Kong in 2002 and started infecting people in the Mekong Delta two years later, killing 54 of the 100 people known to have contracted it. The American C.D.C. was among the organizations that came to assist, training staff members and helping improve Cambodia� public health laboratory so that samples would no longer have to be sent to France for analysis, which took a month to return a result. The U.S. Agency for International Development began to fund an expanded surveillance program, building on the idea that human, animal and environmental health experts needed to work together. In exchange, the United States got access to virus samples that allowed the C.D.C. to track emerging pathogens, which helped inform development of new vaccines and therapeutics. The U.S.A.I.D. has invested $30 million in Cambodia� avian influenza response since 2006, and the World Bank has added $19.5 million from its new Pandemic Fund. Hospitals in Cambodia are now required to send the national lab five samples a month from patients with febrile illnesses, and samples from anyone with a severe respiratory illness. The agriculture ministry has similar requirements for livestock. The recent news from the United States of bird flu in dairy cows has alarmed the Cambodians. �he lesson learned from the U.S. is that we need to look more in these other animals and do more tests,�aid Dr. Tum Sothyra, director of the National Animal Health and Production Research Institute. The ministry is expanding testing to animals that are likely to eat infected birds, such as ferrets and wild dogs, but he hopes it can find the funds to test cows as well. People in villages will report a sick buffalo, cow or pig, he said. Those could be a family� most important asset �nd if people see a neighbor� buffalo die, they worry about their own. Poultry, however, is more difficult to surveil. Cambodians typically only eat chickens or ducks around the big national holidays, such as Khmer New Year in early April �ut there are at least 50 million birds being raised in people� yards. Dr. Sothyra� staff collects samples from birds at markets across the country but can do little to trace the source when they find one that is positive for H5N1. The birds have been sold by then, and in any case, they may have passed through a dozen middlemen who combine flocks on the journey from household to market. The World Organization for Animal Health recommends culling all birds in a radius of one kilometer (about two-thirds of a mile) from anywhere a bird has been found to have H5N1, but Cambodia culls birds only at the households and the immediate neighbors of confirmed cases. �overnment recognizes the economic impact on people would be enormous,�aid Dr. Makara Hak, animal health adviser with the United Nations�ood and Agriculture Organization office in Phnom Penh. He added, �ometimes I feel that people don� think about the potential loss of life.� Dr. Sothyra said the Cambodian government� position is that it cannot afford compensation for culled birds and that it does not wish to encourage people to spread disease to get a payout for their birds. But the lack of compensation means people are reluctant to report sick chickens. And despite a national public education campaign, they often eat those they find dead. �ou ask people, �hy did you eat it?��r. Hak said. �nd they say, �f I don� eat, I don� live.�� Sam Chuon, a 56-year-old nurse who ran a community health center, was among those who died. He ate a chicken he had found dead, even though posters warning against it hung in his clinic. No mourners allowed Mr. Chuon was diagnosed with H5N1 from a posthumous sample after he died in an ambulance on the way to the capital on Oct. 7. The next day, a 2-year-old girl who lived 15 kilometers away, died of the virus. The overlapping cases spooked public health officials. There seemed at first to be no connection between them, but an epidemiology field team eventually discovered that a poultry trader had visited both villages a few days before the nurse and the child fell sick. Tith Na, the girl� grandmother, knew that dead chickens could be dangerous, and so when her family� birds began to die, she cooked them but did not let her granddaughter, Yurin, 2, eat the meal. When the child fell ill a few days later, the clinic said she probably had dengue fever. When Yurin, a talkative toddler, was still limp and silent with fever five days later, the family scraped together the money to hire a car and a driver to take her to the national pediatric hospital in Phnom Penh, three hours away. Yurin died there the next day, a few hours before her infection with H5N1 had been confirmed. Hours after the family took her body home, public health officials came for the rest of their birds. Police ensured that no one from the community attended her cremation or joined her family as they buried her in the rice paddy in front of their one-room house. Her death still seems unreal to the family �he health workers in hazmat suits, spraying disinfectant; the lonely cremation, all because of virus that belongs in birds.

Dr. Sovann, the head of the Cambodian C.D.C., said he knows there is still considerable public education to be done about avian influenza.

Allies on Guard Against Bird Flu,1716249600000,"As Dr. Sreyleak Luch drove to work the morning of Feb. 8, through busy sunbaked streets in Cambodia's Mekong river delta, she played the overnight voice messages from her team. The condition of a 9-year-old boy she had been caring for had deteriorated sharply, and he had been intubated, one doctor reported. What, she wondered, could make the child so sick, so fast?

''And then I just thought: H5N1,'' she recalled. ''It could be bird flu.''

When she arrived at the airy yellow children's ward at the provincial hospital in Kratie, she immediately asked the child's father if the family had had contact with any sick or dead poultry. He admitted that their rooster had been found dead a few days before and that the family had eaten it.

Dr. Luch told her colleagues her theory. Their responses ranged from dubious to incredulous: A human case of avian influenza had never been reported in their part of eastern Cambodia. They warned her that if she set off the bird flu warning system, many senior government officials might get involved. She risked looking foolish, or worse.

Anxious but increasingly certain, Dr. Luch phoned the local public health department, located just across the street. Within minutes, a team arrived to collect a sample from the child, Virun Roeurn, for testing in a lab.

By then, Virun's distraught parents had lost faith in the hospital. They demanded that he be sent by ambulance to the capital, Phnom Penh. His flu swab sample traveled with him.

Virun died on the journey. At 8 p.m., Cambodia's National Public Health Laboratory confirmed Dr. Luch's suspicion: He had died of highly pathogenic avian influenza.

Dr. Luch berated herself for not having thought to test the boy a day earlier, when she might have saved him if she had treated him for influenza.

But the alarm she raised and the urgent activity that followed was testament to the strength of Cambodia's disease tracking system and to its importance to the global biosurveillance system.

It is the fruit of years of international and local investment, training and public education. It shows how frontline work in low-income countries is increasingly vital to a global system to detect zoonotic diseases -- pathogens that jump between animals and humans, the way Covid-19 did. The goal is to identify and contain them, buying time to produce enough vaccines or drugs to treat them, or to embark on a frantic mission to develop something new.

A growing threat

H5N1 is one of many viruses that cause influenza in birds. It emerged in Hong Kong in 1996 and has since evolved into versions that have caused outbreaks in wild and farmed birds and have occasionally jumped to humans.

In 2020, a new, especially deadly one caught the attention of scientists as it spread along migratory routes to parts of Africa, Asia and Europe.

By 2022, it had reached North and South America and was killing wild and domestic animals, including livestock and marine mammals.

So scientists were alarmed when, in February 2023, Cambodia reported two people who had been infected with H5N1. Was this the new version of the virus, returned to Asia and killing people? There had been no such human cases in the country for nearly a decade, though scientists had found that the virus had been present in birds all those years.

Genetic analysis established that the virus infecting Cambodians was the familiar subtype, not the one in the Americas -- a relief. Still, in the past year, Cambodia has reported 11 people infected with bird flu, and five of them have died, more than anywhere in the world.

Global anxiety about H5N1 has risen higher in recent weeks, since the virus was detected in goats and dairy cows in the United States, and then in a Texas farmworker who fell ill.

As the virus moves between species, scientists fear the potential of the virus to evolve to spread easily not just from birds to mammals, but from person to person.

And so the death of 9-year-old Virun, in a provincial Cambodian town, jolted the global system to attention.

At first light the day after Virun died, a team from the health department in Kratie arrived at the wooden house on stilts where he had lived. They swabbed everyone in the household and in neighboring homes to test for flu and then went on to Virun's school to test his classmates. At the hospital, and in other medical facilities around Kratie, any patient with a fever was screened.

A team from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forests rounded up the family's half-dozen surviving chickens and those of their neighbors and took the birds away to be killed and burned.

The team went door to door through the community, asking everyone about illness in their chicken and ducks. Workers from the Ministry of Environment checked rice paddies and forested areas, looking for die-offs in wild birds; they did not find any.

In Phnom Penh, the national laboratory sent Virun's sample down the road to the Institut Pasteur, the Cambodian outpost of a global network of public health research centers that date from the French colonial era. There, virologists confirmed the H5N1 diagnosis and compared the sample with a decade's worth of influenza samples in the institute's biobank. They confirmed it was the familiar subtype of the virus.

Twenty-four hours after Virun died, the Pasteur lab uploaded genomic sequencing of the virus that had killed him to databases accessible to scientists worldwide. It notified the World Health Organization, which sent out a global alert about a fatal human H5N1 case.

Back in Kratie, there was a new concern: Contact tracing had located another case, Virun's older brother, Virak, 16. He had few symptoms, but spent four days in isolation in the hospital, treated with Tamiflu, until he tested negative.

With the genetic sequences in hand, and after more gentle conversations with Virun's shattered family, the disease detectives felt confident that Virak had been infected by the same dead rooster as Virun -- and not by Virun himself. That meant Virun's death was a chance misfortune, not the beginning of a global catastrophe of sustained human-to-human transmission.

'Text me!'

The effectiveness of Cambodia's surveillance system can be credited in part to one man, Dr. Ly Sovann, a kinetic, apparently unsleeping tropical medicine specialist who runs the Cambodian Center for Disease Control.

''I have two phones, four SIM cards, so I never lose the network anywhere in the country, and people can always reach me,'' Dr. Sovann said, brandishing a cellphone in each hand to demonstrate. ''I tell everyone: Text me! Don't call me! Too many calls! But text me. You see something, you see an unusual respiratory disease, you see a cluster of diarrhea cases -- you text me. Because one, two hours, one day, it can make a big difference.''

His intensity stems from tragedy. Twenty-five years ago, as a young public health official, Dr. Sovann responded to a rural cholera outbreak. Dozens of people had died before the national health ministry even heard about it. When he took charge of the agency, he abolished the slow, bureaucratic system that required provincial-level authorization to send samples to the capital for testing.

He created a national hotline that villagers can call toll free to report a sick or dead animal. He told private clinics and hospitals that the national lab would test their suspicious samples for free. His office issues a news release within hours of a confirmed case of human H5N1 or any other infectious threat.

His openness discomfits some in the hierarchy, his colleagues acknowledge privately. Avian influenza reporting, for example, can hurt the livestock industry -- poultry prices crash each time there is a human case.

Dr. Sovann brushes off the concern.

''Do you imagine that if Cambodia has many, do you think neighboring countries don't have a case?'' he said. ''I say, No. Now if we can detect, it means we're good. It means our surveillance system is working. If you don't detect, it means you don't know.''

But the climate for free exchange of information in Cambodia is deteriorating. The increasingly autocratic government has shuttered independent news organizations. For now, Dr. Sovann still operates with a degree of independence. International organizations supporting disease surveillance here walk a delicate diplomatic line, seeking to keep the information channels open.

Protecting the international network is critical. The collaboration grew out of a deadly bird flu outbreak that began in Hong Kong in 2002 and started infecting people in the Mekong Delta two years later, killing 54 of the 100 people known to have contracted it.

The American C.D.C. was among the organizations that came to assist, training staff members and helping improve Cambodia's public health laboratory so that samples would no longer have to be sent to France for analysis, which took a month to return a result.

The U.S. Agency for International Development began to fund an expanded surveillance program, building on the idea that human, animal and environmental health experts needed to work together.

In exchange, the United States got access to virus samples that allowed the C.D.C. to track emerging pathogens, which helped inform development of new vaccines and therapeutics.

The U.S.A.I.D. has invested $30 million in Cambodia's avian influenza response since 2006, and the World Bank has added $19.5 million from its new Pandemic Fund.

Hospitals in Cambodia are now required to send the national lab five samples a month from patients with febrile illnesses, and samples from anyone with a severe respiratory illness. The agriculture ministry has similar requirements for livestock.

The recent news from the United States of bird flu in dairy cows has alarmed the Cambodians.

''The lesson learned from the U.S. is that we need to look more in these other animals and do more tests,'' said Dr. Tum Sothyra, director of the National Animal Health and Production Research Institute.

The ministry is expanding testing to animals that are likely to eat infected birds, such as ferrets and wild dogs, but he hopes it can find the funds to test cows as well.

People in villages will report a sick buffalo, cow or pig, he said. Those could be a family's most important asset -- and if people see a neighbor's buffalo die, they worry about their own.

Poultry, however, is more difficult to surveil. Cambodians typically only eat chickens or ducks around the big national holidays, such as Khmer New Year in early April -- but there are at least 50 million birds being raised in people's yards.

Dr. Sothyra's staff collects samples from birds at markets across the country but can do little to trace the source when they find one that is positive for H5N1. The birds have been sold by then, and in any case, they may have passed through a dozen middlemen who combine flocks on the journey from household to market.

The W.H.O. recommends culling all birds in a radius of one kilometer (about two-thirds of a mile) from anywhere a bird has been found to have H5N1, but Cambodia culls birds only at the households and the immediate neighbors of confirmed cases.

''Government recognizes the economic impact on people would be enormous,'' said Dr. Makara Hak, animal health adviser with the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization office in Phnom Penh. He added, ''Sometimes I feel that people don't think about the potential loss of life.''

Dr. Sothyra said the Cambodian government's position is that it cannot afford compensation for culled birds and that it does not wish to encourage people to spread disease to get a payout for their birds.

But the lack of compensation means people are reluctant to report sick chickens. And despite a national public education campaign, they often eat those they find dead.

''You ask people, 'Why did you eat it?''' Dr. Hak said. ''And they say, 'If I don't eat, I don't live.'''

Sam Chuon, a 56-year-old nurse who ran a community health center, was among those who died. He ate a chicken he had found dead, even though posters warning against it hung in his clinic.

Today's edition: A landmark law that significantly expanded health care and disability benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances hits a new milestone. Two House Republican leaders are seeking a study of the budgetary impacts of making enhanced Obamacare subsidies permanent. But first �

Bird flu: One reporter's up-close perspective

The H5N1 flu virus and I go way back.

In 1997, I watched as more than a million chickens were slaughtered in Hong Kong to combat the first major global outbreak of the disease. Eighteen people were sickened by the virus and six died, all of whom had close contact with the birds. They were the first deaths in humans.

Though officials in Hong Kong and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were pretty sure H5N1 was unlikely to spread from person to person (and still are), there were mysteries surrounding this flu strain that had suddenly acquired the ability to infect people. Among them: Some workers in Hong Kong's poultry markets had antibodies to the virus but didn't fall ill.

It fell off my radar until late 2005, when birds started dying in biblical numbers in remote eastern Turkey, where residents live in proximity to their animals. When bird flu is detected in an area, best practice is to promptly kill all domesticated fowl to prevent spread of the disease. The government was slow to react and farmers in the area only reluctantly culled their birds, often their main source of income. More than a dozen people were sickened and about a third died, including three of Zeki and Marifet Kocyigit's four children.

I visited the family in their simple cement home during a frigid January and asked if the children had had contact with the birds. ""Of course my children played with our chickens; they are children,"" he said.

Shortly thereafter birds started dying of H5N1 in Greece and Nigeria. It was popping up all over Europe and Africa. Scientists determined that the virus was spreading from wild birds landing among domesticated flocks, making it hard to control by culls.

As wild fowl continued to threaten outbreaks in Europe, several countries mandated that chickens be kept indoors if dead wild birds were found in an area. In 2015, a variant of the H5N1 virus came to the United States, sparking outbreaks and culls on Midwest farms �hough no human deaths.

Last year it turned up in harbor seals.

""This has been a 20-year process,"" said Peter Hotez, an infectious-disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine. ""The first red flag was birds dropping from the sky. The second was harbor seals. The third is, now, cattle.""

Cows in at least 51 dairy cattle herds in nine states have tested positive for the flu, though the full extent of the U.S. outbreak is unclear in part due to reluctance by farmers and farmworkers to cooperate with health officials. One human case has been reported � dairy worker who suffered conjunctivitis.

There are important differences between the Hong Kong outbreak of more than 25 years ago and the current U.S. outbreak. H5N1 today is better understood; health authorities say that in the event of more human cases it should respond to antivirals like Tamiflu, and the CDC says the United States could produce and ship 100 million doses of a vaccine �lready developed �ithin months.

But experts like Hotez still worry. ""Surveillance testing has been very fragmented � don't think cattle was on anyone's radar.""

He likens the virus's appearance in herds to a modest earthquake in San Francisco: ""You know something bigger is likely coming, but you don't know if it'll be one year or 100.""

White House prescriptions 1 million Pact Act claims granted

On tap today: President Biden will gather with veterans and their families in New Hampshire to announce that the federal government has granted 1 million claims under the Pact Act since the bipartisan legislation was signed into law in August 2022.

The milestone means more than 888,000 veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service are receiving new health-care and disability benefits, totaling over $5.7 billion, according to the White House. Texas, Florida and North Carolina lead in the number of claims granted under the landmark law.

The approval rate for claims is around 75 percent. Common conditions include allergic bronchial asthma, hypertension, respiratory issues and certain cancers, according to administration officials.

Agency alert ARPA-H takes on cybersecurity in health care

The Biden administration is funneling more than $50 million into a new initiative aimed at strengthening the cybersecurity defenses of the nation's health-care sector.

Unveiled yesterday by the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, the program will provide ""multiple awards"" to organizations with the best proposals for developing tools to detect and automatically address vulnerabilities in hospital software.

Why it matters: The effort follows February's cyberattack on a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary that triggered a national health payment crisis. This month, a major attack on Ascension, one of the country's largest health systems, knocked patient record systems offline and forced medical staff to log care on paper.

On the Hill House GOP chairs seek study of permanent premium tax credits

House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason T. Smith (R-Mo.) and House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Tex.) are seeking a comprehensive analysis of the budgetary impact of making enhanced Obamacare subsidies permanent.

In a letter sent yesterday to Congressional Budget Office Director Phillip Swagel and Joint Committee on Taxation Chief of Staff Thomas Barthold, the lawmakers expressed concerns about the costs associated with the beefed-up tax credits and whether they could be contributing to inflated health insurance premiums.

A spokesperson for the CBO confirmed that the agency received the letter and said it would respond to the lawmakers directly.

The bigger picture: Making permanent the premium tax credits that help low- and middle-income Americans purchase health insurance was a top priority in Biden's fiscal 2025 budget, as they are slated to expire next year without congressional action.

Reproductive wars Abortion rights amendment moves a step closer to the Nevada ballot

Reproductive rights advocates in Nevada announced yesterday that they submitted nearly double the required number of signatures to place a proposed amendment enshrining abortion access in the state constitution before voters in November.

State officials have until July 8 to verify the signatures for the proposed amendment to be included on the ballot.

A closer look: While abortion is currently legal up to the 24th week of pregnancy in Nevada, advocates aim to safeguard access by proposing a constitutional amendment that protects abortion rights until fetal viability, fearing potential future restrictions.

Wastewater monitoring in Texas picked up an early signal of the bird flu outbreak,1716336000000,"(CNN) � In early March, Dr. Blake Hanson and his colleagues at the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute were
preparing for a fire drill of sorts.
What if a virus with the potential to spark the next pandemic turned up in the wastewater they monitor? And what
if that virus was the bird flu, H5N1, which has killed millions of animals and about half the nearly 900 people it has
infected worldwide over the past two decades?
They gamed out this what-if exercise on a Monday. By Thursday of that same week, Hanson's colleague, Dr.
Michael Tisza, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, was ringing
the alarm.
This time, it was not a drill.
""Mike had called me and said, 'Hey, I think I found it,'"" said Hanson, an epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston who
uses big data methods and genomics to investigate infectious diseases.
That was March 7, about three weeks before the US Department of Agriculture announced that H5N1 had
infected dairy cattle in Texas for the first time.
A different kind of wastewater monitoring
Over the past two years, as the idea of sampling sewer systems for the virus that causes Covid-19 and other
pathogens has caught on across the country, the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute � or TEPHI � took a
different approach.
Rather than looking only for specific viruses, researchers there decided to use advanced techniques and
computers to help sift through the vast soup of genetic material in their wastewater samples. By doing this, they're
able to find viruses they expect to see as well as ones they don't know to look for.
""We can capture every known virus that that's in the sample, and then the computational team will analyze the
data comprehensively and see signals for many viruses, and that's the benefit, I think, of what we're doing relative
to other sites,"" said Dr. Anthony Maresso, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston, who envisioned the system.
At least two other organizations have also been looking for signs of H5N1 in wastewater.
The WastewaterSCAN network, which is directed by researchers at Stanford and Emory Universities and Verily,
recently posted a preprint study showing that it could detect the H5N1 virus in wastewater by looking for one
specific part of the virus.
In addition to that early data, the team has since tested three additional sewer systems: one in North Carolina
near a known H5N1 cattle outbreak, one in a California city that was having an unseasonably high number of
human influenza A cases and one in a city in Hawaii where there are no dairy processing plants and no known
cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza. In each case, the test correctly ruled in or out H5N1 infections. It was
so successful that WastewaterSCAN plans to start using the test at all 190 wastewater sites it monitors.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recently launched a dashboard showing sites where
influenza A viruses are being detected at unusually high levels.
H5N1 is an A strain of the flu virus, like some types of seasonal flu. Detecting A strains now, in the offseason, is a
reasonable proxy for H5N1, Maresso said, but it will be a less useful approach when seasonal influenza picks up
again in the winter.
TEPHI's system, on the other hand, could serve as a first alert for new viruses, the holy grail of pandemic
prevention. Since the team started monitoring in 2022, they have found over 400 viruses in Texas wastewater.
Data at the flush of a toilet
Unlike taking a swab of a person's � or a cow's ��bodily secretions, wastewater monitoring is passive and
doesn't depend on getting permission to test or having a person come into a clinic or emergency room, care that
may be out of reach for farmworkers. Researchers get data every time someone flushes a toilet or perhaps when
wastewater systems treat agricultural waste, such as the permitted disposal of discarded milk.
The biggest drawback of wastewater monitoring is that it is difficult to pinpoint the source of the pathogen.
Since March 4, the date of the sample in which H5N1 was first detected by the TEPHI group, the researchers
have found it all over the state, in the wastewater of nine cities in Texas and in 19 of the 23 sites they monitor.
They did not name the cities they tested in the study but said they did notify local public health authorities and the
CDC about their results.
Their findings were published recently as a preprint study, ahead of scrutiny by outside experts.
Source of the signal is still a mystery
""We don't really know where it's coming from,"" said Dr. Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHouston School of Public
Health and director of TEPHI.
""We can all guess, and some people have their favorite ideas,"" he said, noting that Texas is in the path of two
major flyways for migratory birds and has a large agricultural industry that includes farmed birds and cows.
But H5N1 has been tearing through wild and commercially farmed bird flocks in the US since 2022, when the
team started monitoring wastewater, and they haven't seen it in any of their samples until now.
""Certainly, something that's different now,"" Tisza said, ""is that it's commonly infecting dairy cows.""
Only one person has tested positive for H5N1 in connection with the cattle outbreak. That person, a farm worker
who had close contact with infected cows and developed a severe case of conjunctivitis, or redness and swelling
of the eyes, but no breathing problems or congestion. He was treated with antiviral medications and has
recovered, public health officials said.
The CDC says the current risk to public health is low, but it's keeping a close eye on the situation.
The FDA recently tested 297 samples of dairy products purchased at grocery stores across the country. In
expanded test results released Monday, the agency said, it found samples that were positive for dead fragments
of the H5N1 bird flu virus in 15 of the 38 states where products were processed. About 1 out of every 5 samples
had some traces of the virus, indicating that the outbreak might be more widespread than previously known.
TEPHI's Maresso says they can't rule out that what they are seeing is virus from milk that's been poured down the
drain or even asymptomatic human infections. He notes that they are not seeing an increase in flu cases in
hospitals, which would alert them to severe infections.
""It would be maybe a more easily solvable puzzle if it was just one or two sites and we had some dairy or other
processing plants right near that that plant where we're sampling from. It would explain things. but we have
essentially detected the signal on in nearly every site and certainly every city to this point,"" Maresso said � even
big cities in the state that aren't near dairy farms.
As far as the direction of the Texas outbreak, whether it's getting worse or going away, Tisza says, it's hard to
say. At first, he said, some cities his group monitors had a signal from H5N1 that was as strong as the one they
see from seasonal influenza over the winter.
""But overall, it's been only maybe about 25 percent of that signal,"" he said.
""As far as the overall trajectory, it's really kind of at a plateau right now. Not spiking up, not going away. So that in
and of itself is interesting,"" said Tisza, who notes that they're keeping an eye on it. ""And I'm sure you'll hear from
us again if there's a big spike.""",CNN,yes,no,"The article mentions that bird flu H5N1 has killed about half of the nearly 900 people it has infected worldwide over the past two decades, indicating a high human mortality rate.

The Checkup With Dr. Wen: Another farmworker caught H5N1. What worries me is what comes next.,1716422400000,"You're reading The Checkup With Dr. Wen, a newsletter on how to navigate medical and public health challenges. Click here to get the full newsletter in your inbox, including answers to reader questions and a summary of new scientific research.

Health officials on Wednesday announced a new human case of avian flu, the second from presumed cow-to-human transmission and the third ever H5N1 infection in the United States. While I agree with their assessment that the risk of bird flu remains low for most Americans, this new case raises questions and concerns.

Here's what we know: The case involves a farmworker in Michigan who was regularly exposed to livestock, including cows infected with avian flu. The person had only mild symptoms, specifically conjunctivitis (or inflammation of the eye), and has recovered.

This course of illness mirrors that of the Texas dairy worker who tested positive last month for H5N1, which is reassuring. In the past, H5N1 has led to severe illness in humans, with a global fatality rate of more than 50 percent, but these cases were mild. The same is true of the instance in 2022 of a man in Colorado who contracted the virus from poultry.

Another reassuring aspect is that the Michigan farmworker was enrolled in what's called an active monitoring program. Nirav D. Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, explained on a call with reporters Wednesday that the worker was being tracked by the state's health department. This person received a daily text message asking if they were experiencing any symptoms. After acknowledging some eye redness, the state offered to test them right away.

Such active monitoring is terrific. It allows farmworkers, many of whom normally lack health-care access, a direct line to report symptoms and receive public health guidance.

However, Shah said about 170 people are enrolled in the Michigan program, which seems low. Michigan has 19 farms across nine counties that are known to have H5N1 outbreaks. It's great that active monitoring was successful, but what about workers not in the program?

Another number that stuck out to me during the briefing: About 40 people have been tested for H5N1 since March. Again, this seems low �ery low. Especially since avian flu has manifested in the three U.S. cases as mild symptoms, could there be additional human infections that we don't know about because they were never flagged and tested?

Curiously, the Michigan farmworker tested negative via nasal swab, the traditional method used to detect influenza. The positive test was the result of a conjunctival swab, meaning it was taken by lowering the eyelid and rubbing the swab directly on the eye.

On the one hand, the lack of virus in a nasal swab is good news. A major factor in determining how concerned we should be is how easily the virus spreads. High viral concentrations in someone's nose and mouth increase the likelihood of the virus being spread to others. While it's certainly possible to spread infections through eye secretions, the transmissibility should not be as high as, for example, the coronavirus, which can be spread simply by breathing and talking.

On the other hand, clinicians need to be extra vigilant. They should follow the guidance from the CDC not only to take the traditional nasopharyngeal swab but also to test the eye. And those exposed to potentially infected cows and poultry should be alert to conjunctivitis as a possible symptom of H5N1.

Federal health leaders stressed that they are hard at work to ensure that treatments and vaccines will be ready to deploy if needed. I agree that we are much better prepared to handle avian flu compared with the start of covid-19. I also agree that this is not the time for most Americans to start changing behaviors, such as avoiding dairy products. After all, the human H5N1 cases thus far have all been in people with direct contact with infected animals. There has been no instance of human-to-human transmission in this outbreak.

What worries me is what comes next. Shah referred to ""variable cooperation among farmworkers"" in the call and alluded to Michigan being among the states with a more fine-tuned public health response. As avian flu spreads to more herds, the chance of additional human cases increases, requiring more engagement with farms, workers and health departments.

Indeed, Shah advises these entities around the country to ""take steps to prepare for the possibility that their jurisdiction, their farm or the workers that they work with, and their organizations may themselves experience a case of H5N1.""

"Meat from sick dairy cow tested positive for H5N1 flu virus at slaughterhouse but did not enter food supply, USDA says",1716508800000,"(CNN) � Meat from a dairy cow that was culled from its herd because of illness has tested positive for traces of the H5N1 bird flu virus, the US Department of Agriculture announced Friday, but no meat from the cow entered the food supply.
The USDA said viral particles of H5N1 were detected during testing of various tissues, including samples from the diaphragm muscle, which sits below the lungs. The testing was done as a standard part of the food inspection process, the USDA said.
 Infectious disease experts around the world have been on alert since the USDA announced March 25 that a dairy cow tested positive for H5N1 influenza.
H5N1 is a highly pathogenic form of bird flu that scientists have watched closely since it was detected in 1996. It has decimated wild bird populations and poultry flocks but only sporadically infects humans. When it does, it can be fatal: About half of the roughly 900 people known to be infected around the world over the past two decades have died.
In the past two years, the virus has changed and begun to infect a growing assortment of mammals. Experts never expected the virus to show up in cows, as it was thought that they didn't have the right receptors on their cells to catch A-strain flu viruses � but it turns out they do.
In this outbreak, the virus has mostly been showing up in the milk of dairy cows and causing mastitis, or an infection of the mammary gland. Cows stop producing as much milk, but they generally recover after a few weeks.
Two US farmworkers are known to have tested positive in conjunction with the ongoing dairy cow outbreak. In both cases, the virus infected their eyes, causing redness and swelling, but they recovered.
Finding a cow that tested positive for H5N1 postmortem, after systemic disease, suggests that the virus may be making some animals sicker than has previously been known. It also suggests that the owners may not have tested the animal before its slaughter and that other cows in the herd may be infected.
The USDA said the dead cow tested positive for H5N1 on May 22. It has notified the owners and is tracing the animal to the herd it came from to get more information, the agency said.
The USDA says samples taken from 95 other cows that were culled for illness had no signs of the virus as of May 22, and testing is underway on about a dozen more samples. The test the USDA used, which is called polymerase chain reaction testing or PCR, identified genetic material from H5N1 virus, but it could not determine whether that material was infectious and could have made someone sick.
Earlier tests on samples of ground beef using a different virus as a stand-in for H5N1 found that the virus was killed when the burgers were cooked to at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit, or medium. Cooking burgers to rare, a temperature of 120 degrees, substantially reduced levels of active virus but did not kill it all. The USDA already recommends that burgers be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees to kill dangerous pathogens such as salmonella and E. coli.",CNN,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that about half of the roughly 900 people known to be infected have died.

Why the biggest threat of bird flu is government disinformation,1717200000000,"A new strain of bird flu is spreading rapidly. It began in Asia in 2020, arrived in Canada in 2021 and reached the US a year later, killing tens of millions of birds and tens of thousands of sea mammals. So far, bird flu � whose human mortality rate is being touted as 50% � has only been transmitted from animals to people. But with bird flu DNA detectable in 20% of all milk sold in the United States, if a mutation occurs, human-to-human transmission could be possible. Bird flu is hardly the only threat to world health right now. Monkeypox is back, raging across the Democratic Republic of Congo featuring a strain far deadlier than the one that broke out in 2022. Millions of birds have been culled during the bird flu crisis, which began in Asia and has now reached the US. Getty Images While health authorities may be alarmed about these viruses, Americans ought to be alarmed about our health authorities. Because if public health officials treat these outbreaks like they did the last, the response to any new pandemic could be worse than the virus itself. The problem begins with our authorities' penchant for distorting risk. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, for instance, health officials predicted as many as 120 million people would die. Governments stockpiled vaccines. But just as soon as the pandemic began, it ended. Vaccines expired. The death count was that of mild seasonal influenza. By the time Covid struck a decade later, things had only gotten worse. Media bombarded America with images of devastation. The doomsy distortions had their desired effect: By March 2020, the University of Southern California Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey showed that average Americans believed the risk of death from COVID-19 was 25% � on par with the Ebola virus. Donald Trump was lambasted when he tried to offer a more nuanced view of the COVID threat. YUKI IWAMURA/POOL/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Never mind that just a month earlier, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci and CDC Director Robert Redfield wrote that COVID's real mortality figure was less than 1%. Yet when then-President Donald Trump tried correcting the record � ""a fraction of 1%,"" he declared in a March 2020 interview � he was accused of ""spreading misinformation."" Months later, Americans still believed COVID's death rate was 20%; Fauci's response: the nation needs ""to be more afraid."" The lockdowns and school closures soon followed, sold as something every country must do. But not everyone agreed: In March 2020, nearly 1,000 experts � including future CDC Director Rochelle Walensky � warned in an open letter to Mike Pence about the uncertain benefits of lockdowns. Health officials downplayed the unique risks Monkeypox posed for Gay men in order to avoid ""stigma."" The result: Cases kept on piling up. Getty Images/iStockphoto Things only worsened when vaccines arrived the following year, touted by CDC Director Walensky to completely block virus transmission and ""end the pandemic"" � despite clear evidence to the contrary. Adverse events from the vaccine were ignored; masks that science knew were useless became obligatory. The consequences were harrowing. Lockdowns likely caused millions of deaths and created massive economic disruption. School closures set back child development. Vaccine mandates and misinformation increased vaccine hesitancy and destroyed trust in public health. The brief monkeypox pandemic of 2022 fit a similar pattern. Gay and bisexual men accounted for 96% of all cases, yet health officials maintained ""anyone can get monkeypox"" in order to reduce potential stigma. In the end, the CDC prioritized feelings over disease prevention � and the cases piled upwards. Moderna's stock price recently surged thanks to efforts by the pharma giant to develop an effective bird flu vaccine. REUTERS During COVID-19 and monkeypox, policy was created first�and then the data was distorted to justify it. Prominent scientists who questioned this approach were condemned and punished, while tech giants censored dissenting opinions, according to a recent House of Representatives report. We already see the media following the same script with bird flu. Fewer than 1% of infected cattle die from the disease; and the real risk of death in humans is almost certainly far lower than that grim 50% figure, according to scientific experts. The CDC, too, continues its bizarre behavior. Earlier this month, they recommended N95s masks and goggles for dairy workers. Yet N95s are ineffective for seasonal influenza, which is identical in viral structure to bird flu. Professor Michael Osterholm of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, points out that goggles readily fog, increasing risk of worker injury. Dr. Anthony Fauci has talked about the horrid side effects of Covid-19. Getty Images for Haddad Media As for vaccines, the Department of Health and Human services recently assured journalists that stockpiles of vaccines for bird flu are ready to deploy. However, the scant clinical testing that has been conducted was on an outdated 2020 version of the vaccine. Making the establishment scientific again starts with accountability. Some progress has been made: top NIH officials have faced bipartisan criticism and disciplinary action over COVID-19's origins. But otherwise, pandemic response leaders continue receiving plaudits, pensions, and prestigious new jobs. The Biden DOJ also continues to block criminal investigations into COVID mismanagement. But change cannot come fast enough to combat bird flu, both the disease and the accompanying misinformation. Earlier this month, the CDC detected elevated levels of influenza A, of which bird flu is a subtype, in US wastewater. What was not reported was that these levels were, on average, still lower than normal. Misrepresented data just to get a story � sound familiar? Meanwhile, just last week a second case of dairy-linked bird flu was reported in Michigan. Also reported: rapid progress to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine.

How Michigan became ground zero for H5 avian influenza in the US,1717372800000,"Michigan has become ground zero for the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus that's sweeping the nation, killing turkeys, chickens and wild birds, infecting cows and other mammals �nd now has sickened a third U.S. farmworker.

The Great Lakes state has more dairy cattle herds known to be infected with avian influenza than any other state in the U.S., with 24 outbreaks in 10 counties as of Friday, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It now also has two farmworkers with confirmed bird flu infections �ransmitted to them by close contact with sick cows.

Texas is the only other state where a person is known to have contracted the H5N1 virus from a cow, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That state has reported 15 cattle herd infections since March. Seven other states �daho, South Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio and North Carolina �lso have cow herds with known infections, the USDA reported.

The reason Michigan's tally of livestock outbreaks and farmworkers with avian influenza is higher than other states is not because Michigan is especially ripe for viral activity or because there's something different about the state's cows or workers, said Dr. Arnold Monto, emeritus professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan and co-director of the Michigan Center for Respiratory Virus Research and Response.

""The main reason we're detecting more infection is because we're doing very good surveillance,"" Monto said. ""Other states need to do the same.... It's being missed.""

The CDC reported May 22 that 40 people had been tested for highly pathogenic avian influenza nationally. The same day, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical officer, told the Free Press that 35 Michigan farmworkers had undergone testing.

That means only five people tested as of May 22 were from states other than Michigan. It also means the reach of the virus ""is certainly more widespread"" nationally than anyone currently knows, Monto said.

""The conclusions are pretty obvious when you hear things like that,"" said Monto. ""If you don't look, you're not going to find it. What we need is to get serious about it in terms of how we handle surveillance because if you don't know it's there and don't have regulations in place... it's going to spread even more.""

The CDC updated its testing and monitoring data Friday, saying 44 people have now been tested nationally for the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, and more than 390 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected or potentially infected animals.

The agency said it is also stepping up national surveillance/testing by:

* Asking local labs to send more samples for subtyping to the CDC and state public health labs to test for the H5N1 virus.

* Extending reporting of flu-related hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network. The CDC typically stops reporting influenza hospitalizations from May-September because it� ordinarily such a seasonal virus. So far, the CDC said its surveillance systems show no indication of unusual flu activity in people.

* Increasing outreach through state and local health departments to health care providers and clinics about H5N1 symptoms so avian influenza is considered when patients with conjunctivitis or respiratory illness and a history of exposure to animals seek medical care.

How the virus came to Michigan cow herds

The outbreak of H5N1 virus in dairy cattle �ith spillover to humans �egan in Texas just a few months ago. It came to Michigan in late March, when infected cows crossed state lines, said Tim Boring, the director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

""We know that a farm in Montcalm County initially (had an outbreak) as a result of cattle movement,"" Boring said, ""and we've seen an expansion of our cases out of that general area since then.""

Calling the H5N1 outbreak among poultry and cattle in Michigan an ""extraordinary emergency,"" Boring issued an order May 1 that required all dairy and commercial poultry farms in Michigan to adopt biosecurity practices to slow the spread of the virus.

Among the requirements: Farms must secure animal areas, establish a perimeter and limit access. They must name a biosecurity manager and train employees, and establish cleaning and disinfection practices for all with contact within the perimeter, including delivery drivers. They must keep log books tracking all who enter and leave.

The order also prohibited all lactating dairy cattle, and those in the last two months of pregnancy, from being exhibited at fairs and festivals until there are no new cases of the virus statewide in dairy cattle for at least 60 consecutive days. Similarly, poultry also cannot be taken to exhibitions, fairs or festivals until no new cases of the virus have been detected in domestic poultry for at least 30 consecutive days.

The state agriculture department also teamed up closely with state and local health departments to ensure people would be protected, Boring said.

""In Michigan, we're testing in animals and we're testing in people and we've seen really strong coordination between animal and human health components within the state level, the federal level and on the local level,"" he told the Free Press on Friday. ""Part of the reason that we've seen good responses on testing is because of the involvement of local health departments. Those are trusted community partners. They are neighbors, not folks coming in from out of town. We're taking this really seriously. It's a proactive approach. This is both an animal and a public health concern, and we're managing it as such.""

Still, Boring said, there are many unanswered questions about this virus, including how it spreads.

""We likely have a multifactorial transmission matrix going on of how the virus spreads from dairy farm to dairy farm.... We're getting a better handle on it every day, and we're continuing to lead across the country of what the response looks like.""

Human cases so far have been mild

All three people known to be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza in the U.S. this year have had mild symptoms.

The Texas farmworker and the first person in Michigan to get ill from exposure to infected cattle reported only conjunctivitis, or pink eye. In the second Michigan case, which was announced Thursday, a farmworker had upper respiratory tract symptoms, including cough without fever, and eye discomfort with watery discharge, the CDC reported.

There is concern among scientists that the impact on people could change, as more animals get infected.

The more the virus spreads in animals, the greater the likelihood of human exposures and transmission, Monto said, which also increases the odds that the virus could mutate in a way that would allow H5N1 to spread from person to person or cause more severe disease.

""That's why we really need to control it �ot because we're sure that is going to happen, but because if that does happen, there's a chance it's going to be pretty bad,"" Monto said.

The CDC is conducting genetic sequencing on the most recent human case in Michigan to determine what, if any changes, there might be.

All three known human cases so far involved the 2.3.4.4b lineage of the virus that is nearly identical to the H5N1 viruses circulating in U.S. dairy cows, the CDC reported.

In samples taken from the infected eye of the first Michigan farmworker, whose case was announced May 22, the CDC identified a mutation that allows mammals to be infected more easily. However, it did not contain changes that would likely make it easier for the virus to spread from human to human.

And that's key, Monto said.

""We're lucky that there are receptor-binding issues that are preventing it from getting into humans easily,"" Monto said, ""because if it were easy to transmit, with all of the workers that are on these farms handling the equipment, which is heavily contaminated, we would see more cases.""

The virus affects animals, people differently

The impact of the virus on animals so far has been extremely variable, said Timothy Cernak, an assistant professor of chemistry and medicinal chemistry at the University of Michigan.

""The virus behaves different in each species,"" said Cernak, whose work centers on developing new antiviral drugs that could be added to the arsenal of current antivirals to help stop a potential avian flu outbreak. ""There are species that it gets into and they just don't seem to notice,"" while others get very sick and others see mass die-offs.

The current H5N1 strain in the U.S. is extremely deadly in birds and cats, sea lions, raccoons and skunks.

Dairy cows get sick from the virus but don't typically die. A report from Michigan State University suggests cows on one Michigan farm with an H5N1 outbreak had high fevers and dehydration. There was a drop in rumination as well, which turns the grass they eat into energy and milk. Milk production dropped dramatically, and some pregnant cows miscarried.

Last week, the USDA reported that alpacas in Idaho also have contracted the virus. And mice became sick within a day of drinking raw milk from an infected cow. The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter from researchers at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Existing text... Diagnostic Laboratory that showed the mice had high levels of virus in their organs. Levels also were high in the mammary glands of two mice �ven though the mice were not lactating.

""In elephant seals it killed 96% of the pups from last year,"" Cernak said, adding that the virus also devastated the bald eagle population and affected horned owls. ""It's entirely possible in wild populations, there are significant risks of extinction-level events happening.""

For humans, he said a different subtype of H5N1 avian influenza that spread in Cambodia from 2003 to 2023 caused severe illness and deaths.

""In Cambodia, the fatality rate in humans was really high, and that's the concerning thing,"" Cernak said. Of 64 people who contracted the other subtype of the virus, 41 died, according to the World Health Organization.

Could respiratory symptoms signal easier human-to-human spread?

For now, as the bird flu circulating in the U.S. has remained mild in the few human cases, Cernak said he is concerned about the potential for respiratory transmission to give this virus a boost.

""The biggest risk that we have is that it mutates toward respiratory transmission,"" he told the Free Press last week �efore the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced that the state does now, in fact, have a farmworker with H5 infection and respiratory symptoms.

It's unclear, however, whether having those symptoms will make it easier to spread the virus from person to person.

Joe Coyle, deputy state epidemiologist and director of the MDHHS Bureau of Infectious Disease, said it's the first time respiratory symptoms have been associated with a human H5N1 influenza case following contact with sick cows.

""Generally speaking, with something like influenza and respiratory viruses, when you have respiratory symptoms, you're more likely to spread the virus than if it was just conjunctivitis like the previous case we had in Michigan and the one in Texas,"" Coyle said.

""It is a new presentation, and it's something that we'll definitely be looking at... to see if this represents a different mutation of the virus that's causing these types of symptoms, or is it really the same virus but just a different route of transmission with respect to the human exposure.""

The CDC reported that the farmworker with respiratory symptoms was treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir, better known as Tamiflu, and is isolating at home. None of the person's contacts have developed symptoms and all are being monitored and offered antiviral medication.

More outreach to farms needed

Dr. Adam Lauring, an associate professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at U-M, said there are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to the current U.S. H5N1 avian influenza outbreak.

""Often in the health field, we are maybe appropriately focused on the humans, but the wider the outbreak is in animals, the more risk there is of humans being infected because there are more potential contacts,"" he said.

""I think everyone's trying to understand different ways that it could be spreading among dairy cattle within a herd and also between herds or between farms, and I think that's an important thing that we need to really get a better understanding of.

""In terms of how far it has spread in humans, that is dependent on really being able to do good surveillance, which is challenging in this situation in that it depends on people coming to attention, reporting their symptoms, getting tested.""

Many farmworkers are undocumented migrant workers for whom English might not be a first language and who might be concerned about being deported if they say they are sick or seek medical care.

""A lot of these populations are hard to reach,"" Lauring said. ""I know MDHHS has been doing outreach to try to do as best they can with surveillance for symptoms in people to try to catch anyone who could be infected, and also then to offer testing. That's how, for example, this (first) case in Michigan was identified was through this program.""

Michigan, he said, appears to have done a better job than many other states. It has created a daily text-message surveillance system, available in English and in Spanish, that asks workers to detail whether they have symptoms. Anyone who answers yes is then offered testing by local public health workers.

Testing is encouraged, but not required, and the federal government now is reimbursing farms for some of the losses they have incurred from H5N1 outbreaks and testing.

""This is an ongoing, evolving situation and it's important to pay attention to that,"" Lauring said. ""Fortunately, the risk to the general population is low, but we need to pay attention and reach out to farms and people working with the farms and work together to control the outbreak.""

'We're flying blind'

Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and consultant for several health organizations including the CDC, wrote on a post on her substack, ""Your Local Epidemiologist,"" that the H5N1 situation in the U.S. is far from controlled.

""We are flying blind,"" she said. ""We don� know how this virus is spreading, where it is spreading, and if it� becoming better at infecting humans.""

Lack of trust in public health in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, farmworkers' fears of deportation and language barriers, along with farmers' concerns about the financial impact the H5N1 outbreaks all are affecting surveillance efforts.

""It shouldn� be shocking that few are volunteering to test for H5N1,"" she wrote.

Animal testing for avian influenza viruses in Michigan is done through MSU's Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. Positive results are sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for confirmatory testing, Boring said.

If an animal's test result is positive, ""we work closely with local and state health officials to make sure that local health is on farms, working with farmworkers, apprising them of everything they need to know about what this virus means and maintaining and tracking some human safety aspects there,"" he said.

That includes ensuring personal protective gear �uch as face shields or goggles, respirator masks, rubber coveralls and boots �re available to workers on farms with infected animals. Although wearing PPE is recommended, it isn't mandatory.

""We're doing everything we can to assist those human health partners to be getting equipment out to not only just farms, but within those CDC guidelines around processing plants as well.

""We've had a few farms take us up on that, but the base PPE that makes so much of a difference in these cases �ye protection, gloves �hat is equipment a lot of farms have on hand already.""

Neither of the Michigan farmworkers who were infected by cows wore fully protective equipment, said Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, in a statement issued Thursday. One was splashed in the eye with milk from an infected cow and the other had ""direct exposure to an infected cow.""

""This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms,"" she said.

For protection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service recommends that anyone who is within 6 feet of an infected cow should wear:

* Safety goggles or a face shield

* Disposable gloves

* Boots or boot covers

* A respirator, such as an N95 mask

* Fluid-resistant coveralls

* Head covering

Many questions about avian influenza remain unanswered

There remain many questions with wide implications, Monto said, when it comes to how this virus is behaving.

Among them, he said: For how long is a cow infectious? Will infections be sustained on farms or will they be able to be rid of the virus over time? Why are lactating cows so susceptible and why are virus particles so concentrated in their milk?

""What is going on in the mixed dairy-beef cattle farms? A cow is a cow,"" said Monto.

He noted that in one out of 109 samples of beef tested in late May by the USDA� Food Safety and Inspection Service, H5N1 viral particles were detected in muscle tissue. In ground beef that was inoculated with high levels of virus, cooking it to at least 145 degrees (medium) or 160 degrees (well done) killed the H5N1 virus.

""Even cooking burgers to 120 (rare) degrees, which is well below the recommended temperature, substantially inactivated the virus,"" the USDA reported.

And though similar testing of commercial milk found H5N1 viral fragments, those particles were inactivated by pasteurization and were unable to cause infection. Raw milk from infected cows, however, has been shown to be a risk for infection.

""We do know that raw milk is full of the virus,"" Monto said. ""We know that we shouldn't be drinking unpasteurized milk and some people are (obsessed with) drinking unpasteurized milk.""

Monto said scientists still don't know whether the milk of other animals �r humans �s infectious when they contract avian influenza.

""This virus is now spreading wherever they shipped dairy cows. It's come all the way from Texas to Michigan. And it's come to a variety of other states,"" Monto said.

""We need to control the infection in cattle, and that will lower the probability of humans becoming infected.""

"First-ever human case of H5N2 bird flu reported in Mexico, WHO says",1717545600000,"(CNN) � Even as the United States grapples with an outbreak of H5N1 flu in dairy cattle, the World Health
Organization has announced the first known human infection with a different strain, H5N2, in a person in Mexico
who died of complications of their infection.
Both of these strains of the influenza A virus have primarily affected farmed and wild birds, infecting flocks around
the world. About 900 human cases of H5N1 have been reported since 1996, and about half of people known to
be infected have died. On Wednesday, WHO said it had confirmed the first case of human infection of H5N2 in a
59-year-old resident of Mexico.
The source of the person's infection is unknown, although WHO noted that H5N2 viruses had been reported in
poultry in Mexico.
Because any new influenza A infection in people has the potential for high public health impact, it must be
reported to WHO. The organization said that based on current knowledge, the risk to the general public from
H5N2 is low, since other H5 subtypes are known to infect humans but none has been shown to cause sustained
human-to-human spread.
The person, who had multiple underlying medical conditions, had been bedridden for three weeks for other
reasons before they developed new symptoms. In mid-April, they developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea,
nausea and weakness. On April 24, they sought medical attention and were hospitalized at the National Institute
of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City. The person died of complications that day.
On May 8, a sample sent for specialized testing indicated that it was positive for H5N2, and the result was
subsequently confirmed by a different lab.
Of 17 people at the hospital who'd been in contact with the patient, no further cases were identified. Twelve
additional contacts were identified near the person's residence, and seven of those had symptoms, but testing of
samples from these cases didn't identify Covid-19 or any type of flu. Scientists are now testing blood samples to
see whether they can find antibodies that would point to past infections.
In March, an H5N2 outbreak was reported in a backyard poultry farm in a neighboring state to the one where the
person lived. According to WHO, it hasn't been possible to establish whether this case is related to recent poultry
outbreaks.
Flu viruses normally circulate in birds but occasionally can jump to other species, including humans. People catch
the viruses from direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments.
Depending on the original host, type A flu strains can be classified as bird flu, swine flu or other types of animal
influenza viruses.
Bird flu infections in humans can cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. Eye
infections like conjunctivitis, gut symptoms and brain swelling are also possible.",CNN,yes,no,"The article reports that about half of the people known to be infected with H5N1 have died, indicating a high human mortality rate.

These are the bird flu questions that influenza and animal scientists desperately want answered,1717545600000,"Ten weeks after government scientists discovered that H5N1 bird flu was sickening dairy cattle in the United States, many of the mysteries surrounding what is happening on affected farms remain just that. Widespread reluctance on the part of farmers to allow scientists �overnment or otherwise � nto their premises to study spread of the virus among infected cows has created a frustrating lack of understanding of the dynamics of this outbreak. U.S. Department of Agriculture incentives aimed at getting farmers to test their cows and take preventive measures to protect both animals and farmworkers do not seem to have solved the impasse, even as the outbreak has affected 82 herds in nine states. It’s not lost on many scientists, here and abroad, that the paucity of data coming out of the U.S. is not dissimilar to the limited information flow out of China in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic — a situation the U.S and other governments complained about loudly at the time. With the shoe on the other foot, however, there is no overt effort to make farmers cooperate. “A lot of criticism was leveled at China for their early response to Covid-19 — some of it reasonable, a lot of it extremely ignorant. Are we currently making some of those mistakes ourselves?” wondered Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist and a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif. Investigating outbreaks always takes time. But it is startling this far into this situation that so many questions appear to be no closer to answers. Related: A third U.S. farmworker infected with bird flu is the first to experience respiratory symptoms To get a sense of what the key questions are, STAT asked scientists who have long worked on influenza or in veterinary medicine what they viewed as the most pressing questions. Sixteen answered individually; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention answered collectively for three flu experts within its ranks whose opinions we sought. The answers — their questions — roughly fit into three buckets: What’s happening on the farms among cows? What’s happening on farms among farmworkers? What’s happening to the virus and what does this all portend for H5N1, which for nearly three decades has danced around humans but has yet to take us on directly. The biggest bucket: What is happening with the cows? Ron Fouchier, a flu virologist at Erasmus Medical Center in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, summed up what underlies all of the cow-related questions with the single question he submitted. It was, effectively: How can spread in cows be stopped, and the sooner the better? “If this virus becomes enzootic” — endemic or entrenched — “in cows, it could well cause massive damage to human and animal health in the longer term,” Fouchier wrote. “I would find it unacceptable if authorities in the U.S.A. and/or the sector do not try to eradicate this new disease in cows a.s.a.p. If this is not deemed possible, I think the entire world would like to see the evidence and arguments.” Isabella Eckerle, a virologist at the Geneva Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, expressed a similarly overarching sentiment. “What is the plan of farmers and health authorities to get rid of this virus in the cow population to prevent further spread and mutation, or worse, major spillover to humans?” Figuring out how to stop the spread of the virus in U.S. cattle herds requires far more information than exists in the public domain, however. Many of the experts we asked said what’s known about how the virus is spreading among cows cannot be the whole story. Related: In light of H5N1 outbreak, U.S. in talks with mRNA vaccine makers on bird flu Cow udders appear to be exquisitely sensitive to this virus; when dairy cattle are infected, their milk production decreases markedly and the milk they do produce is altered in color and viscosity. Milk from infected animals contains surprisingly high levels of virus. It’s believed that milking machines, which are not cleaned after each cow is milked, have been spreading the virus from infected to uninfected animals. But some cows reportedly have mild respiratory symptoms and nasal discharge, raising questions about whether cows are also spreading the virus more in the way humans spread flu. “There is a consensus building that this is most likely mechanical transmission through milking but I don’t think that answers a lot of questions/explains some of the weirdness,” said Thomas Peacock, an influenza virologist at the Pirbright Institute, a British organization that focuses on controlling viral illnesses in animals. “I don’t understand how if the virus is only transmitting through milk machines it got back into poultry (or alpacas!).” While it is believed that this outbreak was caused by a single “spillover” event, when H5N1-infected wild birds somehow passed the virus to a cow or cows, the virus that has been spreading in cows has since spilled back into wild birds. Farm cats, domestic poultry, the odd carnivore species, and a herd of alpacas in Idaho have also been infected with this strain of the virus. Six of 18 alpacas in the herd became infected; three that were pregnant had spontaneous abortions. There have also been three mild human infections associated with this outbreak; all have been in farmworkers. Related: USDA faulted for disclosing scant information about outbreaks of H5N1 avian flu in cattle Martin Beer, director of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut in Riems, Germany, lists a number of data points scientists need to know to try to figure out how to stop this outbreak. The number of cows in a herd that have been infected, which could be determined by looking for antibodies in their blood. The percentage of animals that shed virus — in other words, the portion that are infectious. Whether they emit virus from their muzzles or in their feces. How much virus is shed via those routes as compared to what is seen in milk? Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine who is working on an H5N1 vaccine, has a trio of intertwined questions. Do cows that are infected but have no symptoms emit virus? Would quarantining infected cows stop spread within a herd? And how long are infected cows infectious? “It will be easier to control this virus if the infectious period is short. But this might not be the case,” Hensley noted. Colleen Webb agreed that the specifics of spread in cattle need to be elucidated. “We know the basic epidemiological information for other avian influenza hosts, but not dairy cattle, and dairy cattle are different enough from these other hosts that we need dairy cattle-specific information,” said Webb, dean of the graduate school at Colorado State University, whose research focuses on data-driven modeling of disease and evaluation of preparedness and control strategies in livestock diseases. Lots of data from a number of affected farms would answer these questions. In the absence of it, experimental infections of cows in laboratories can start to generate crucial information. Jürgen Richt, a veterinarian and director of the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases at Kansas State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, is currently doing just this type of research. So is Beer. Florian Krammer, a flu virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, thinks it’s important to find out whether vaccinating cattle would stop transmission of the virus in herds — specifically whether vaccine doses created for people in the federal government’s stockpile could be used to tamp out spread. “Large scale vaccination in cows may be able to stop the outbreak,” he argued. There remains the question of how widespread the virus is in herds in the U.S. Given that H5 viral particles have been found in a substantial portion of commercially purchased milk — one in five samples bought in 38 states — the belief is that the herds that have been confirmed are a tip of the iceberg. But is that so? How far has this spread? Related: When should we start making H5N1 vaccine, and who will make that decision? In short, it’s complicated “We still don’t know how many farms are affected and that’s a big problem for containment. As long as undetected cases are out there, new infections can and will occur,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, Canada. Like Rasmussen, Diego Diel, a virologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., would like to know how far the virus has spread in cows. “Is the virus circulating in other countries … such as Mexico and Canada?” he wondered. So far Canadian authorities report they have not found the virus in cows. And work Rasmussen and an ad hoc team of researchers from across Canada have done looking for traces of H5N1 in store-bought milk has so far failed to turn up any positive results. Finally, there is the question of whether this virus is now on its way to being seeded in cattle in the United States — permanently circulating among cows and adapting to better infect them. Will cows who have recovered from the virus have the capacity to catch it again? Humans, after all, only develop transient immunity when they have a bout of flu. “What is going to happen when a recovered herd gets infected again? Maybe someone knows the answer to this already, but I don’t,” said Richard Webby, a flu virologist and director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals, located at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. “Will this disease burn out, or continue to circulate?” Webby wondered whether cows can be reinfected, and if so, whether subsequent infections differ from the initial one, with potentially different amounts of virus in the milk of infected cows, for instance. Though experimental infections might help to start generating an answer to this question, the best way to answer it would be to monitor farms that have been affected. Andersen worries what the consequences will be if we get to the point where this question can be answered. “We will eventually find out, however, this is a good example of ‘Let’s not,’” he said. “Let’s just focus on stopping the current epizootic in cattle.” What’s happening to farmworkers? Within days of the USDA’s confirmation that H5N1 was infecting cows in some herds in Texas, Kansas, and Michigan, a human infection was confirmed. A farm worker developed a florid case of conjunctivitis — pink eye. A swab of his eye contained the bird flu virus. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy Since then, two more bird flu cases have been detected in people, both in Michigan. One also had conjunctivitis, but more recently a farmworker developed more classical flu-like symptoms. There have also been many anecdotal reports of other cases of conjunctivitis on affected farms, and experts believe there have been more human cases than have been confirmed. In addition to the reluctance of farmers to cooperate with authorities trying to study the situation, many of these workers are migrants. Some are likely undocumented. Many may not have access to health care, and may be frightened about interacting with government officials. There is great interest in doing serology studies among farm workers — drawing blood to look for antibodies to H5N1 to try to get a handle on how often the virus is infecting people on farms. Getting approval to do this work has been challenging. The Texas farmworker refused to give blood. Without better access to workers, it’s hard to assess where the risk is highest on dairy farms, and hard to put together practical, usable programs to protect them. “While we know that people with direct, unprotected exposure to animals infected with H5N1 are the most likely to get sick with the virus themselves, CDC is still working to determine how exactly that infection occurs,” the agency told STAT in its submitted questions. “Understanding and defining the specific risky behaviors is important so that we can then translate that into the best means of prevention.” Meghan Davis concurred. A dairy and mixed animal veterinarian who teaches in Johns Hopkins University’s department of environmental health and engineering and medical school, Davis said that understanding specifically how workers are being exposed on farms could lead to the identification of better ways to use personal protective equipment or even other protective approaches that don’t involve PPE. Farmworkers have been reluctant to wear masks and goggles; the heat in barns makes these tools impractical and even potentially dangerous, impeding their vision of what’s going on around them. Related: New evidence supports fear that drinking raw milk containing bird flu viruses may be dangerous “This would be done with exposure studies on positive farms that would involve sampling of a lot of pathways of exposure — air, water, waste — and would include what we call personal exposure assessment,” she said. Rasmussen would like to know whether the route of exposure to the virus — a splash of milk in the eye, say, versus inhalation of virus-laced particles — affects the type of infection an exposed individual develops, and the severity of the ensuing illness. What is happening to the virus? Since H5N1 was first isolated from a goose in China’s Guangdong province in 1996, the virus has undergone extensive evolution. There are now several clades — sub-families, if you will — of the virus circulating in various parts of the world, moved around by wild birds. The version responsible for the outbreak in cows is a virus identified as clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13. While this clade also circulates in Europe, the B3.13 genotype has not been spotted there. Until this outbreak, cows were never thought to be susceptible to H5N1. Beer had shown calves could be infected in a lab, but in the real world, cows had never been part of the H5 story. Is this outbreak a sign that something about the virus changed? Or was it just a lightning strike? This is a question a number of the scientists had. “Are other 2.3.4.4b viruses with other gene constellations also able to infect cattle?” wondered Kanta Subbarao, a flu virologist at Laval University in Quebec City, Canada. Related: CDC asks states and cities to keep flu surveillance at peak levels because of bird flu threat Richt, the veterinarian from Kansas State University who is experimentally infecting dairy cattle, also wants to know whether this H5 virus is special, or if it just got lucky. “Nobody knows whether this ‘bovine H5N1’ is unique or not. Maybe regular ‘avian H5N1’ viruses are able to infect cattle too,” he said. Beer wants to know whether this version of the virus has changes that allow it to infect the mammary gland so efficiently, or whether other versions of 2.3.4.4b — ones circulating in Europe, say — could also do this if they got the opportunity. Yoshihiro Kawaoka put into words a question that worries many scientists watching this situation, the worry that underscored Fouchier’s insistence that this outbreak must be stopped as quickly as possible. “We do not know whether the bovine H5N1 virus will become established in cattle,” wrote Kawaoka, a flu virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “If it does, will it evolve to adapt more towards ‘mammalian-like’ influenza viruses? … Will it pose a risk to human health?” To date, the virus has not been seen to have the capacity to transmit efficiently among a mammalian species; any changes it acquires to allow it to do that could make H5N1 more adept at infecting humans. Eckerle wonders if we’d know it, in real time, if the virus starts to change in ways that might signal dangerous adaptations for mammal-to-mammal spread. The USDA has been uploading basic genetic data to an international database, but those sequences do not indicate when the virus was collected or in which part of the country. It has been slow to share more complete genetic sequences, to the deep frustration of the scientific community. With this approach, there might be a delay in recognizing the development. An intriguing curveball Malik Peiris, who has studied the H5N1 virus since it started to infect people back in 1997 in Hong Kong, raised an intriguing and potentially hopeful question. Peiris, who is chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, wonders whether the risk that H5N1 poses to people has changed in the decades since H5 first started infecting humans. Over the years, close to 900 people in 24 countries are known to have been infected, and about half of them have died. Related: Wastewater testing specifically for bird flu virus will scale up nationally in coming weeks Peiris and colleagues wonder, though, whether the 2009 H1N1 pandemic lowered the risk H5N1 poses. The neuraminidase protein on the 2009 virus, the N1, is quite similar, genetically, to the neuraminidase in H5N1. His group in Hong Kong has tested the blood of people who likely had H1N1 — which has circulated in the years since the 2009 pandemic — and tested stored blood samples from before 2009, looking to see if, when exposed to H5N1 virus, cross-reactive antibodies that might kickstart an immune response to H5N1 are present. Their study is small, but suggestive that because of how similar the viruses are, some people may have antibodies that could help in the face of H5N1 exposure. It should be noted that in the years since 2009, there have been about 425 detected cases of H5N1 infection worldwide, of which about 180 were fatal. In the past decade, though, human cases have been less frequent and somewhat less likely to end in death. “We need to ascertain how much protection this cross-N1 antibody will provide against H5N1 infection, at least to mitigate disease severity,” Peiris said, adding that his group is continuing to work on this question. “The question is what biological protective effect will they exert, if any?” Andrew Joseph contributed reporting.",STAT,yes,yes,"The article mentions that over the years, close to 900 people in 24 countries are known to have been infected with H5N1, and about half of them have died, indicating a high human mortality rate.

"A man in Mexico died with one form of bird flu, but US officials remain focused on another",1717632000000,"NEW YORK (AP) �he mysterious death of a man in Mexico who had one kind of bird flu is unrelated to outbreaks of a different type at U.S. dairy farms, experts say.

Here� a look at the case and the different types of bird flu.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MEXICO BIRD FLU CASE?

A 59-year-old man in Mexico who had been bedridden because of chronic health problems developed a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea in April. He died a week later, and the World Health Organization this week reported it.

The WHO said it was the first time that version of bird flu �5N2 �ad been seen in a person.

WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE U.S. WITH BIRD FLU?

A different version of bird flu �5N1 �as been infecting poultry flocks over the last several years, leading to millions of birds being culled. It also has been spreading among all different kinds of animals around the world.

This year, that flu was detected in U.S. dairy farms. Dozens of herd have seen infections, most recently in Iowa and Minnesota.

The cow outbreak has been tied to three reported illnesses in farmworkers, one in Texas and two in Michigan. Each had only mild symptoms.

WHAT'S DO THE LETTERS AND NUMBERS MEAN IN BIRD FLU NAMES?

So-called influenza A viruses are the only viruses tied to human flu pandemics, so their appearance in animals and people is a concern. These viruses are divided into subtypes based on what kinds of proteins they have on their surface �emagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).

Scientists say there are 18 different ��ubtypes and 11 different ��ubtypes, and they appear in scores of combinations. H1N1 and H3N2 are common causes of seasonal flu among humans. There are many versions seen in animals as well.

H5N1, the version that has worried some U.S. scientists lately, historically has been seen mainly in birds, but has in recent years has spread to a wide variety of mammals.

WHAT IS H5N2?

H5N2 has long been seen in Mexican poultry, and farms vaccinate against it.

It's also no stranger to the United States. An H5N2 outbreak hit a flock of 7,000 chickens in south-central Texas in 2004, the first time in two decades a dangerous-to-poultry avian flu appeared in the U.S.

H5N2 also was mainly responsible for a wave outbreaks at U.S. commercial poultry farms in 2014 and 2015.

HOW DANGEROUS IS H5N2?

Over the years, H5N2 has teetered between being considered a mild threat to birds and a severe threat, but it hasn't been considered much of a human threat at all.

A decade ago, researchers used mice and ferrets to study the strain afflicting U.S. poultry at the time, and concluded it was less likely to spread and less lethal than H5N1. Officials also said there was no evidence it was spreading among people.

Rare cases of animal infections are reported each year, so it's not unexpected that a person was diagnosed with H5N2.

""If you�e a glass half full kind of person, you� say, �his is the system doing exactly what it� supposed to do: detecting and documenting these rare human infections, where years ago we were stumbling in the dark,��aid Matthew Ferrari, director of Penn State's Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics.

Indeed, Mexico Health Secretary Jorge Alcocer said kidney and respiratory failure �ot the virus �ctually caused the man's death.

Some experts said it is noteworthy that it's not known how he caught the man caught H5N2.

�he fact there was no reported contact (with an infected bird) does raise the possibility that he was infected by someone else who visited him, but it� premature to jump to those conclusions,�aid Richard Webby, a flu researcher at St. Jude Children� Research Hospital in Memphis.

WHAT ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF BIRD FLU?

At this point, H5N2 is still considered a minor threat compared to some of the other kinds of bird flu out there. Most human illnesses have been attributed to H7N9, H5N6 and H5N1 bird flu viruses.

From early 2013 through October 2017, five outbreaks of H7N9 were blamed for killing more than 600 people in China. And at least 18 people in China died during an outbreak of H5N6 in 2021, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

H5N1 was first identified in 1959, but didn't really began to worry health officials until a Hong Kong outbreak in 1997 that involved severe human illnesses and deaths.

H5N1 cases have continued since then, the vast majority of them involving direct contact between people and infected animals. Globally, more than 460 human deaths have been identified since 2003, according to WHO statistics that suggest it can kill as many as half of the people reported to be infected.

Like other viruses, H5N1 as evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself. In the last few years, the predominant version of the virus has spread quickly among a wide range of animals, but counts of human fatalities have slowed.

How Much Worse Would a Bird-Flu Pandemic Be?,1717718400000,"Updated at 12:05 p.m. ET on June 7, 2024

Our most recent flu pandemic�009� H1N1 �wine flu��as, in absolute terms, a public-health crisis. By scientists�bestestimates, roughly 200,000 to 300,000 people around the world died; countless more fell sick. Kids, younger adults, and pregnant people were hit especially hard.

That said, it could have been far worse. Of the known flu pandemics, 2009� took the fewest lives; during the H1N1 pandemic that preceded it, which began in 1918, a flu virus infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide, at least 50 million of whom died. Even some recent seasonal flus have killed more people than swine flu did. With swine flu, �e got lucky,�eema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University, told me. H5N1 avian flu, which has been transmitting wildly among animals, has not yet spread in earnest among humans. Should that change, though, the world� next flu pandemic might not afford us the same break.

[Read: Cows have almost certainly infected more than two people with bird flu]

Swine flu caught scientists by surprise. At the time, many researchers were dead certain that an H5N1, erupting out of somewhere in Asia, would be the next Big Bad Flu. Their focus was on birds; hardly anyone was watching the pigs. But the virus, a descendant of the devastating flu strain that caused the 1918 pandemic, found its way into swine and rapidly gained the ability to hack into human airway cells. It was also great at traveling airborne�eatures that made it well positioned to wreak global havoc, Lakdawala said. By the time experts caught on to swine flu� true threat, �e were already seeing a ton of human cases,�ahid Bhadelia, the founding director of the Boston University Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases, told me. Researchers had to scramble to catch up. But testing was intermittent, and reporting of cases was inconsistent, making it difficult for scientists to get a handle on the virus� spread. Months passed before the rollout of a new vaccine began, and uptake was meager. Even in well-resourced countries such as the U.S., few protections hindered the virus� initial onslaught.

But the worst never came to pass�or reasons that experts still don� understand. Certainly, compared with the 1918 pandemic, or even those in the 1950s and �0s, modern medicine was better equipped to test for and treat flu; although vaccine uptake has never been perfect, the availability of any shots increased protection overall, Sam Scarpino, an infectious-disease modeler and the director of AI and life sciences at Northeastern University, told me. Subtler effects may have played a role too. Other H1N1 viruses had been circulating globally since the late 1970s, potentially affording much of the population a degree of immunity, Troy Sutton, a virologist at Pennsylvania State University, told me. Older people, especially, may have harbored an extra dose of defense, from additional exposure to H1N1 strains from the first half of the 20th century. (After the 1918 pandemic, versions of that virus stuck around, and continued to percolate through the population for decades.) Those bonus safeguards might help explain why younger people were so severely affected in 2009, Lakdawala told me.

Some of those same factors could end up playing a role in an H5N1 epidemic. But 2009 represents an imperfect template�specially when so much about this new avian flu remains unclear. True human-to-human spread of H5N1 is still a distant possibility: For that, the virus would almost certainly need to undergo some major evolutionary alterationsto its genome, potentially even transforming into something almost unrecognizable. All of this muddies any predictions about how a future outbreak might unfold.

Still, experts are keeping a close eye on a few factors that could raise H5N1� risks. For instance, no versions of H5N1 flu have ever gained a sustained foothold in people, which means �here� very little immunity in the community,�Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told me.

Exposure to other flu strains could offer limited protection. Lakdawala and Sutton have been running experiments in ferrets, which transmit and fall ill with flu much like people do. Their preliminary results suggest that animals with previous exposures to seasonal-flu strains experience milder disease when they�e next hit with this particular H5N1. That said, ferrets with zero prior flu experience�hich would be the case for some very young kids�are poorly, worse than they do with the H1N1 of 2009, and �hat� scary,�akdawala told me.

It� too early to say how those results would translate into people, for whom data are sparse. Since this H5N1 virus was first detected in the 1990s, scientists have recorded hundreds of human cases, nearly half of whom have died. (Avian flus that spill intermittently people often have this kind of nasty track record: This week, the WHO reported that another kind of bird flu, designated H5N2, killed a man in Mexico in late April. It was the flu subtype� first recorded instance in a human; no evidence suggests yet that this virus has the ability to spread among people, either.) Experts caution strongly against reading too much into the stats: No one can be certain how many people the virus has actually infected, making it impossible to estimate a true fatality rate. The virus has also shape-shifted over decades�nd the versions of it that killed those people did not seem capable of spreading among them. As Sutton pointed out, past experiments suggest that the mutations that could make H5 viruses more transmissible might also make them a bit less deadly. That� not a guarantee, however: The 1918 flu, for instance, �ransmitted really well in humans and caused very severe disease,�utton said.

Scientists also can� extrapolate much from the fact that recent H5N1 infections among dairy workers in the U.S. have been documented as mild. Many people who work on farms are relatively young and healthy, Bhadelia noted; plus, their exposures have, presumably, been through virus-laden raw milk. The virus could affect a different community in more dramatic ways, and the nature of the disease could shift if the virus entered the body via another route. And �ildness�n the short term isn� always a comfort, Scarpino said: As with COVID, the disease could still have chronic consequences for someone� health.

The world is in some ways better prepared for H5N1 than it was in 2009. Scientists have had eyes on this particular avian flu for decades; in the past few years alone, they�e watched it hopscotch into dozens of animal species, and tracked the genetic tweaks it� made. Already, U.S. experts are testing for the pathogen in wastewater, and federal regulators have taken action to halt its spread in poultry and livestock. H5 vaccines are stockpiled, and more are on the way� pipeline that may be speedier than ever before, thanks to the recent addition of mRNA tech.

[Read: The bird-flu host we should worry about]

But this close to the worst days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Osterholm and others worry that halting any outbreak will be harder than it otherwise would have been. �e could see many, many individuals refusing to get a vaccine,�e said. (That may be especially true if two doses are required for protection.) Bhadelia echoed that concern, adding that she� already seeing a deluge of misinformation on social media. And Scarpino noted that, after the raging debates over COVID-era school closures, legislators may refuse to entertain the option again�ven though children are some of the best conduits for flu viruses. Stopping a pandemic requires trust, coordination, and public buy-in. On that front alone, Osterholm said, �ithout a doubt, I think we�e less prepared.�

The world has a track record of not taking flu seriously�ven, sometimes, when it sparks a pandemic. In the months following the initial outbreaks of swine flu, the outbreak was mocked as a nothingburger; public-health officials were criticized for crying wolf. But the arguably �ild�lu epidemic still filled hospital emergency departments with pneumonia cases, spreading the virus to scores of health-care workers; kids still fell sick in droves. So many young people died that, in terms of years of life lost, Osterholm told me, the toll of 2009 still exceeded those of the flu pandemics that began in 1957 and 1968. Nor are comparisons with seasonal flus exactly a comfort: Most years, those epidemics kill tens of thousands of people in the U.S. alone.

Bird flu is rampant in animals. Humans ignore it at our own peril,1718064000000,"(CNN) � Mark Naniot remembers 2022 as the summer from hell.
As the co-founder of Wild Instincts animal rescue in Wisconsin's Northwoods, Naniot and his team spent the
season sweating in gloves, gowns, smocks and masks and going through what felt like endless rounds of
disinfection as they moved between the cages of the sick and injured animals they cared for.
The precautions were necessary for a trio of infectious diseases occurring with some frequency in wild animals
that summer: Covid-19 was still making life difficult, and a devastating contagion called chronic wasting disease
was showing up in deer in the area.
Then, there was H5N1 bird flu to contend with. ""It's highly, highly transmissible,"" said Naniot, who has been
involved in animal rescue for 35 years.
Since it was first discovered in birds in 1996, H5N1 has shown itself to be a Swiss Army Knife of a virus, evolving
the necessary tools to break into the cells of a growing list of species. So far, it has infected and killed millions of
wild and farmed birds. It's also been found in at least 26 different kinds of mammals, including, most recently in
the United States � cows, cats and house mice.
The voraciousness of the virus added link prompted Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist of the World Health
Organization in April to call it ""a global zoonotic animal pandemic.""
Along the way, people have been a kind of collateral damage. Humans can be infected, but we aren't really the
intended targets.
That could all change quickly, however.
""Influenza actually makes mutations, in the sense of making errors copying its genome, at a higher rate than a
coronavirus like SARS-CoV2,"" said Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist who focuses on influenza viruses
at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle.
These errors don't always work in favor of the virus. Most of the time, viruses with errors won't work or be fit
enough to continue to copy and survive. But every once in a while, a random error can result in a change to the
virus that give it an advantage in its environment, and that version of the virus will continue to spread and grow.
If humans happen to be that environment, and H5N1 changes at the right place at the right time, suddenly the
animal pandemic could become a major problem for people, too.
Naniot had seen wild birds come into Wild Instincts rescue with H5N1 � bald eagles, hawks and owls � but
nothing had prepared him for the red fox kits.
The baby foxes were brought in stumbling and uncoordinated, making him think they might have gotten into some
kind of poison. Then the seizures started.
""They would have these severe, severe seizures,"" Naniot said. ""Screaming very loud, whole-body tremors.""
The first seizures lasted for 20 to 30 seconds at a time. ""And then it would get longer and longer and longer,"" he
said.
Naniot hadn't known his young patients could get bird flu. Further research clued him in to the fact that foxes had
recently joined a growing list of species that could succumb, usually after eating the flesh of infected dead birds.
""The severity of the seizures is something I really hadn't seen before,"" Naniot said. ""It's a very sad thing to see,
the progression of the disease.""
Risks to humans
Though H5N1 is known to have infected nearly 900 people in the past 30 years, these infections have been
sporadic and usually self-limiting. The virus can still be deadly, however: More than 50% of people who are
known to have been infected with H5N1 have died.
Still, the virus isn't particularly good at infecting humans. Even when virus manages to get into a person and
cause symptoms, it rarely gets passed to someone else.
""We call these dead-end infections,"" said Dr. Scott Weese, a veterinarian and expert in zoonotic infections, at the
University of Guelph in Canada.
The way a dead-end infection happens, Weese explains, is that a person is around a large amount of the virus, or
their immune system is too weak to resist, and H5N1 gets in. But it is not a virus that's well-adapted to humans,
so it never really builds up in respiratory secretions � the fluid that coats the nose, throat, and lungs � which
would give it a way out through coughs, sneezes or even exhaled breath.
There have been at least three of these have apparently dead-end infections in dairy workers in the US, who
worked closely with infected milk cows. Two of the workers developed conjunctivitis, or eye infections. In one
case, the worker reported getting splashed with raw milk in their eyes. A third developed respiratory symptoms
after close contact with cows. All were successfully treated with an antiviral medication. None developed severe
symptoms or infected others.
Using a strain of H5N1 from the recent cattle outbreak, scientists recently confirmed that this version of the virus
is unlikely to transmit through the air. In experiments with ferrets, which are considered the gold standard for
studying how viruses transmit in people, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grew
a sample of the same H5N1 virus taken from a farmworker with the flu in Texas to experimentally infect six of the
animals. Then, three healthy ferrets were placed in the same enclosures with three of the sick animals. These
animals could touch, nose and lick the sick animals, and all of them became ill.
Next, the CDC tested airborne transmission by putting three healthy ferrets into an enclosure where they could
breathe the same air as sick animals but couldn't touch them. Only one of those three animals became ill,
suggesting that the virus carried by cattle in the current outbreak is not well adapted to respiratory spread, the
CDC wrote in a news release on the study.
So far, that seems to be what's happening in the real world, too. Though more than 80 dairy herds have tested
positive across at least 12 states, the number of human infections has apparently been low, though there's been
little testing to confirm that.
These early ferret experiments are good news, the CDC noted, because it means the virus would need to change
to become an infection spread person-to-person through the airborne droplets. The agency said it plans to repeat
the tests.
As Covid has shown, all of this could change in the the rub of an eye or a small cough. The more opportunity the
virus has to spread, the more opportunity it has to change in ways that will help it pry its way into human cells.
""It's really important to understand everything we know today is a snapshot of today, and these viruses can
change very quickly,"" said Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and former director of the US Biomedical Advanced
Research and Development Authority in an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta
for the Chasing Life podcast.
""They can adapt, and they can spread very easily when they do change,"" said Bright, who is now CEO of Bright
Global Health.
Dr. Erin Sorrell, a virologist and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says that while
humans have been exposed to seasonal strains of the flu, and flu vaccines help build immunity H1 and H3 flu
strains, H5N1 would look pretty different to our bodies.
""Our existing immunity to H3 and H1 is not necessarily going to protect us against exposure to an H5 virus,"" she
said.
The CDC's ferret study also had some sobering findings. In contrast to seasonal flu, which makes ferrets sick, but
doesn't kill them, H5N1 killed all the ferrets that were infected.
""While the three cases of A(H5N1) in the United States have been mild, it is possible that there will be serious
illnesses among people,"" the CDC wrote in its conclusions on the study.
In the more than two dozen human infections with H5N1 virus worldwide since 2022, with the most recent
iteration of the virus, there's been a wide spectrum of severity. Fourteen illnesses were severe or critical, seven
were fatal, six were mild and eight didn't have any symptoms at all, according to the CDC.
Dr. Seema Lakdawala, a microbiologist and immunologist at Emory University who specializes in the flu, thinks
the difference in symptom severity may be due to previous exposure to seasonal viruses. Her experiments in
ferrets suggest that our bodies wouldn't necessarily be totally defenseless. In her lab, ferrets with previous
exposures to seasonal flu strains didn't get as sick when exposed to new flu viruses compared to those with no
prior exposure to seasonal strains. She says she hasn't tested this with any of the strains involved in the cattle
outbreak, however.
So while we probably don't have any antibodies � the immune system's front-line soldiers � at the ready to fight
off an H5 infection, there are memory cells in our tissues that might recognize parts of a new flu virus and
respond.
How much help we might get from past exposures to flu viruses is difficult to predict, however, which is why
vaccination would still be important to tune up our immunity.
Plans to stop the virus from spreading
The US has vaccines against H5 viruses in its Strategic National Stockpile, and last month, government officials
said 4.8 million doses are being ""filled and finished"" so they would be ready for use, though there's no plan to give
them to anyone yet.
Finland has already ordered 20,000 doses of a different H5 strain � H5N8 � which, will be used as soon as
they're available to protect workers who might be vulnerable to the virus, such as scientists and those in direct
contact with infected animals on mink farms, local officials told health and science news outlet, STAT News.
For now, the CDC maintains its assessment that the risk to the general public from H5N1 is low, though people
who work with infected animals have a higher risk and should wear protective clothing and take additional
precautions to avoid getting sick. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, has
made that protective equipment available to states for use on farms, and the USDA has made additional funding
available to farms to support efforts to safeguard their livestock from disease.
But so far, wearing this equipment is voluntary, and there are concerns that it might be difficult for farm workers to
wear the full recommended kit, which includes coveralls, an apron, a mask, eye protection, a head covering,
gloves and boots during the summer, which is again expected to break heat records.
The government has also said it is working on the development of a rapid test for H5N1.
Bright thinks severity of symptoms may depend on how much virus a person is exposed to when they are
infected. Touching contaminated milk or the body of a dead bird and then rubbing your eyes or nose might deliver
a smaller dose of the virus, and ultimately result in milder symptoms. Whereas ingesting large amount of virus �
as some animals do when they scavenge for food or as humans in some countries do when consuming dishes
made with duck blood � could lead to severe disease.
""The virus is able to infect a number of internal organs. So it doesn't just locate, say, in the lungs, as we would
think most influenza viruses would,"" Bright said. It's also been found in ""the brains and then the spleens, the
intestines, and the heart and throughout the body of those animals.""
Dr. Richard Webby, who directs the WHO's Collaborating Centre on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds
at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, agrees.
""It's at the top of the list in terms of bad guy viruses,"" he said, noting that the virus is nerve-loving, or neurotropic.
""So it goes to the brain and causes very, very severe disease.""
Infected animals often behave strangely or aggressively. Ducks waddle in circles, twisting their necks, writhing on
the ground.
""I would hate to see it in humans,"" Webby said.
So far, the virus hasn't made the changes that would enable it to become a fully human pathogen, said Dr.
Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of
Minnesota. It's unclear whether it ever will.
""I've been a student of this virus. And I surely have been amazed at how it's changed over the course of the last
20-some years, but at the same time, you know, I'm looking for evidence that it is likely to become a virus
infecting humans and then transmitted by humans to other humans. And we just haven't seen that yet,"" he added.
Naniot at the Wisconsin animal rescue said they tried to save about seven infected fox kits in the summer of
2022, but all of them died.
Other rescue organizations in their network had a few foxes infected with H5N1 that survived, but they ultimately
went blind.
While all the precautions they took to safely work with the animals were arduous, Naniot said he's grateful they
were effective. They never spread the virus to any of the other animals in the facility � including themselves.
""Unfortunately, it's kind of like when Covid went through, you know, it first started someplace,"" he said.
Naniot says he hasn't encountered any infected animals since 2022, but he's watching the news closely in case
any cow herds become infected in Wisconsin, knowing that he could easily see H5N1 again.

"Opinion: Getting farmworkers to use PPE is hard, but it� the best way to stop an H5N1 bird flu epidemic",1718150400000,"Although a third U.S. dairy worker has been confirmed to be infected with the H5N1 bird flu, many dairy farms are still unwilling to use even freely offered personal protective equipment (PPE). This is cause for alarm.

Working with a pathogen assigned a biosafety level of 3 �meaning it �an cause serious or potentially lethal disease through respiratory transmission��ith at best BSL 2 level protections is playing with fire.

This lack of protection leaves farmworkers who interact with potentially infected animals, including dairy cows, chickens, and alpacas, at risk for infection with a virus that has killed half of the people in whom it was diagnosed. And the more H5N1 is able to interact with and infect people, the greater the risk that it might accumulate the handful of mutations it needs to become capable of human-to-human transmission, a stepping stone to a possible epidemic. The single most effective way to ward off a potential crisis of H5N1 bird flu and to protect farmworkers is to ensure they have usable and effective PPE. While several experts have rightfully called for widespread testing of farm animals and workers, many farm owners and workers have been reluctant to test due to concerns of losing work, the undocumented status of many workers in this sector, and financial loss. Even if uptake of testing did improve, it would still identify infections only after they occur. Workers would still be in danger and H5N1 would still be given chances to evolve and potentially leap to human transmissibility. Using PPE to seal the human-animal interface from spillover infections is the only way to protect workers and eliminate the chance for H5N1 to crossover in the first place. Species in the wild, into whom H5N1 has recently crossed, have little interaction with humans. Dairy cattle, chickens, and alpacas, however, are farm animals with whom humans interact on a daily basis. Dairy farms, in particular, pose a unique and heightened risk. The milking process requires workers to spend up to 12 hours a day in direct close contact with cows. Udders have high viral loads and spew infected milk that can readily get into eyes, noses, and mouths, or onto hands and surfaces from where infection could get seeded. There is also the possibility that some H5N1 virus is airborne and causes infection via inhalation. It’s no surprise that all three H5N1 bird flu cases detected in the U.S. have been among dairy workers. FURTHER READING Go deeper: H5N1 bird flu Here are the bird flu questions top scientists would like to see answered. Michigan is doing more bird flu testing than any other state. Will others follow? Producing a H5N1 vaccine is more complicated than you might think. And the world would need a lot of it. And finally, an important avian flu precaution: Don't drink raw milk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued recommendations for farmworkers to use PPE but, given the stakes, a more urgent and rigorous federal effort is needed to ensure that dairy and other animal workers use PPE that is effective and matched to their workflow and conditions. ADVERTISEMENT This is a solvable engineering and cost problem. Greater efforts should be made to understand and target the particular reasons why workers are not using PPE. With the CDC recommendations as a starting point, infection control experts should go through farmworkers’ entire workflow and, with their input, identify the best options for PPE that is adequately protective yet also practically wearable. The highest infection risk seems to be via the face — either infectious milk or secretions getting into the eyes, nose, or mouth, or possibly airborne inhalation. The CDC advises using N95 or elastomeric respirators with goggles or face shields. But the conditions in milking parlors make disposable N95s ineffective when they get wet, and cause goggles and face shields to fog. Elastomeric respirators and goggles remain somewhat effective when wet, but, like disposable N95s, are difficult to wear for long stretches, especially in the heat. Related: Farmers resist push for workers to wear protective gear against bird flu virus A better option for full head protection could be powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), which provide constant filtered airflow into an enclosed hood or helmet. Some PAPRs also have a temperature control. While these devices cost somewhere between $1,000 and $3,000 apiece, similar battery-powered industrial helmets could provide analogous filtration and protection without the potentially cumbersome tubing of a PAPR for about $500. Hands and forearms also need to be reliably protected to prevent infection via breaks in the skin or by later touching the face. Impermeable gloves with sleeves could be used with strict protocols for donning, doffing, and hand-washing. Securing the face and hands may eliminate most transmission risk. Fluid-resistant aprons could also be used to limit splashing on the rest of the body and clothing. Whole-body suits would be more thoroughly protective, but their impermeability may cause them to be difficult to wear in the heat and not worth pursuing if they offer little added infection prevention. If full body protection does, however, seem to be necessary, air or water-cooling garments as well as mandatory cooling breaks could be considered to mitigate the risks of heat stress. There are approximately 150,000 dairy workers in the U.S. Doing extremely simplistic back-of-the-envelope projections, even if it cost $2,000 to protect each worker, the total bill of about $300 million would pale in comparison to the costs of responding to an epidemic of H5N1 bird flu, not to mention the broader economic and social toll of such a crisis. Related: H5N1 doesn’t have to be a repeat of Covid-19’s ‘public health versus the economy’ These costs should be borne by the federal government. Expecting farm owners to foot this bill would kill any chance of it happening, and would unfairly lay on them a public societal responsibility. State governments should be tasked with coordinating with farm owners on distributing PPE and training workers on its use. The gravity and rationale of reliably using PPE should also be made clear to farm owners and workers. Once the potentially catastrophic implications are understood, many would likely be willing to do what they could — even when burdensome — to help avert a crisis. The U.S. is at a crucial juncture with the H5N1 threat. But it has the opportunity to prevent its crossover into humans if animal farm workers get the protection they need, and use it.

"You Don't Have to Worry About Bird Flu, for Now. Here's What to Know. The risk of getting H5N1 is currently very low unless you work on a farm, but there are several changes you should still make to stay healthy",1718236800000,"Avoid raw milk. Lay off cheeses made with unpasteurized milk. And cook your beef to medium- or well-done temperatures.

These are the precautions that public health officials and doctors recommend as they track the H5N1 bird flu outbreak in U.S. cattle. Ten states have H5N1 outbreaks in cows, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and at least three U.S. dairy farmworkers have been diagnosed with bird flu.

A man in Mexico contracted a different strain of bird flu�5N2�arlier this month and died, though he died from underlying conditions, according to the Mexican government.

Doctors and federal officials say the public health risk of getting H5N1 is currently very low unless you work on a farm, and stress that there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. What's raised concern is that the most recent case�ound in a dairy worker in Michigan earlier this month�ad respiratory symptoms unlike the previous two cases where the primary symptom was pinkeye.

Viruses with respiratory symptoms are more contagious and transmissible than conjunctivitis, or pinkeye, so doctors and scientists say they are watching closely. For now, it has been more than a week since the worker tested positive and there have been no known cases of transmission.

""Whenever we see an avian flu get into a new host we become nervous because these viruses tend to adapt to the new host,"" says Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine who is working on an H5N1 vaccine for use in cattle and humans.

The good news, he says, is that the avian influenza circulating now in cows and birds doesn't appear to be able to replicate very effectively in humans.

Still, scientists say that if the virus mutates and adapts, it could start spreading more efficiently in humans, which would require people and public-health systems to take more drastic measures.

At a news conference Thursday, federal officials said increased spread among cattle creates an increased risk for people getting the virus.

""The more infections there are among cows, the more risk there is for infections to occur among humans,"" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""And the more risk there is for infections to occur among humans, the more risk there is for some sort of change to the virus that could take this from what it is right now, which is a low risk to the general population.""

What is bird flu?

There are two main types of influenza, type A viruses and type B. Type A viruses typically produce more serious illness. The flu shots we get every year protect us against two type A viruses and two type B. The A viruses in the flu shot are usually a strain of H3N2 and H1N1.

Dr. Adam Lauring, a professor of infectious diseases, microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan, says there are more than 100 different kinds of influenza A viruses, most of which circulate largely in birds.

Every once in a while one of the flu types circulating in birds will infect another type of animal. This is what happened with H5N1, where it has spread to other animals, including chickens, sea lions and cows in recent years.

The worry right now is preventing exposure and transmission between cows and dairy workers.

""There are lots of potential exposures of people working on dairy farms coming in close contact with the cows and milk,"" says Lauring. ""Those are the people at high risk of getting this right now.""

Drinking pasteurized milk is safe, doctors say, and no virus has been detected in the beef supply despite regular testing over the past few months. Lauring and others recommend cooking meat to medium or medium-well to make sure that if meat is contaminated, any present virus is killed.

""We've always known heat is good at inactivating viruses and bacterial pathogens and it looks like it's effective in inactivating this virus in the milk and cheese and ice cream we buy at the grocery store,"" says Samuel Alcaine, an associate professor of food science at Cornell University focused on dairy food safety.

""I'm still buying my milk from the grocery store,"" he adds.

Raw milk and unpasteurized cheese�ot recommended for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems�hould be avoided for now, say doctors and scientists.

While no studies demonstrate that drinking raw milk from a cow infected with H5N1 could transmit the virus to humans, doctors and researchers say there are red flags. An epidemiological study conducted by the CDC in March found that cats on a Texas farm with cows infected with H5N1 died, presumably from being exposed to or drinking the raw milk, says Alcaine.

When to be concerned

The H5N1 outbreak in cattle has raised concerns because of their multiple interactions with humans in the transport and milking process, according to Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor at Emory University and expert on flu transmission and emerging pandemic threats.

Her group's research has found that influenza viruses are highly stable on milking equipment and may be a source of spread to other cattle and workers.

""If a worker were to get splashed in the nose or eyes and become infected, that human infection would give the virus new opportunities to adapt and start spreading among people,"" she said.

While H5N1 is a part of the class A strain of influenza, the fear from doctors and scientists is that when it spread to humans in a 2004 outbreak in Southeast Asia it had a high mortality rate, says Alcaine. Between 2003 and Dec. 21, 2023, there have been 248 cases of human infection with H5N1, according to the World Health Organization , 139 of which were fatal.

For now, the cows infected with the virus get sick, and their milk production drops, but most recover. ""So far the symptoms of this strain of H5N1 have been relatively mild,"" says Alcaine. ""But I think right now it's wait and see.""

A  Bird-Flu  Pandemic in People? Here� What It Might Look Like.,1718582400000,"There is no guarantee that a person-to-person virus would be benign, scientists say, and vaccines and treatments at hand may not be sufficient.

The bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle has so far spilled over to just three farmworkers in the United States, as far as public health authorities know. All of them have had mostly mild symptoms.

But that does not guarantee that the virus, called H5N1, will remain benign if it begins to spread among people. Accumulating evidence from the animal world and data from other parts of the globe, in fact, suggest the opposite.

Some dairy cows never recovered from H5N1, and died or were slaughtered because of it. Infected terns seemed disoriented and unable to fly. Elephant seal pups had trouble breathing and developed tremors after catching the virus. Infected cats went blind, walking in circles; two-thirds of them died.

� definitely don� think there is room for complacency here,�aid Anice Lowen, a virologist at Emory University.

�5N1 is a highly pathogenic type of influenza virus, and we need to have a high degree of concern around it if it� spilling over into humans,�he said.

In ferrets experimentally inoculated with the virus through their eyes �he presumed route of infection in the U.S. farmworkers �he virus rapidly spread to their airways, lungs, stomach and brain, according to a report published on Wednesday.

Other studies have found similar patterns in mice fed contaminated milk. The findings suggest that entry through the eyes or digestive system ultimately may not make the virus any less a threat.

H5N1 has shown itself to be promiscuous, rapidly gaining new hosts �ild birds and poultry, mice and bears, cats and sea lions. Since its discovery in 1996 in Hong Kong, it has also infected nearly 900 people.

An older version of the virus circulating in Asia has killed about half of those infected.

Of the 15 people known to have been stricken with the version that is now circulating in cattle, one in China died and another was hospitalized. Two patients in Chile and Ecuador had severe symptoms. Four Americans �ne last year and the three infected with the latest outbreak �ave fared better.

Crucially, no forms of the bird flu virus seem to have spread efficiently from person to person. That is no guarantee that H5N1 will not acquire that ability, said Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist and bird flu expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

� think the virus is clearly changing its property, because we never saw outbreaks in cows,�r. Kawaoka said. Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye and the primary symptom in two of the three farmworkers, is not typical of H5N1 infection. The appearance of the virus in mammary glands �n cattle and even in non lactating mice �as also unexpected.

The worry now is that as H5N1 continues to infect mammals and evolve, it may pick up the mutations needed to spread efficiently among people, setting off another pandemic.

The incubation period for flu is two to four days, and a human-to-human version could spread far before cases were detected, said Erin Sorrell, a virologist and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

�f it goes into the general public, it� too late,�he said. �e�e missed the boat.�

Flu is typically most severe in older adults and children under 5. (An outbreak of swine flu in 2009 was not as devastating as feared, yet it killed nearly 1,300 children.) The severity of illness also depends on how much virus the infected patients are exposed to and for how long, as well as the route of entry and their genetic background and general health.

Infected people generally have fever and respiratory symptoms; some cases advance quickly to pneumonia or death. If the bird flu virus were to adapt to people, the world would need billions of doses of vaccines and antivirals to stave off these outcomes.

The federal stockpile holds four types of flu antivirals, but the drugs must be taken within 48 hours of symptom onset to be effective. One recent review found too little evidence to gauge the effectiveness of three of the four drugs, including the commonly used oseltamivir, sold as Tamiflu.

Some new versions of H5N1 have mutations that make the virus resistant to oseltamivir and to the other two drugs, but those changes, fortunately, have not been widely transmitted in animal populations. No mutations have been observed against the fourth drug, baloxavir.

But there are only a few hundred thousand doses of that drug in the stockpile, according to David Boucher, the infectious disease director of the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.

Vaccines are a better bet to stem a pandemic, but enough doses are not likely to be available for many months, at the least. Even if global production of seasonal flu vaccines were entirely shifted to vaccines against H5N1, the number of doses manufactured would be enough for fewer than two billion people, assuming twodoses were needed for each person.

In the United States, the national stockpile holds hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses that could be rolled out to those at risk, including children. Companies contracting with the government could make more than 100 million doses in the first 130 days, Dr. Boucher said.

Officials recently announced that they had taken steps to ready 4.8 million doses that could be bottled without disrupting seasonal flu vaccine production.

But most of these plans will help only if the virus cooperates.

Since H5N1� first appearance, it has branched into many forms, and scientists have created a library of 40 so-called candidate vaccine viruses to match. Having them ready to go saves crucial time, because creating a new candidate can take three months, said Todd Davis, a virologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

So far, he said, the virus has changed only minimally, especially the part of the virus that binds to human cells, called hemagglutinin or HA.

If the virus were to spread among people, it would first have to change significantly, some experts noted. �f this virus jumps into humans, you can bet that the HA is going to change, because right now the HA of this virus does not bind very effectively to human cells,�aid Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania.

Traditional flu vaccines are made by growing candidate viruses in eggs or in mammalian cells, both of which are fraught with potential problems: The virus may not grow quickly enough, or it may mutate too much as it grows.

In 2009, the candidate virus grew well in eggs but evolved into a poor match for wild H1N1 virus, introducing long delays in distribution to the public. �y the time the vaccine stocks were made and distributed, the initial wave of pandemic had already subsided,�r. Hensley said.

CSL Seqirus, a leading manufacturer of seasonal flu vaccines, has a cell-based H5N1 vaccine that is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

In the event of a pandemic, once CSL Seqirus receives a candidate vaccine virus that matches the circulating virus, it could provide 150 million doses for Americans within six months, said Marc Lacey, an executive director at the company. (The firm also has contracts with 19 other countries.)

But 150 million doses would protect only about one in five Americans. Federal officials also are exploring mRNA bird flu vaccines, which could be made very quickly, as the Covid pandemic illustrated, to protect both cows and people. Dr. Hensley� team is testing an mRNA vaccine in cows.

Officials have hesitated to deploy vaccines for cows because of trade concerns, experts said: Some countries bar imports of products from vaccinated birds and animals.

But immunizing cows would curb the risk to farm workers, and to other cows, and limit the opportunities for the virus to keep spreading and evolving, experts said.

So far, federal officials have also been reluctant to vaccinate farm workers, saying that the risk is still low.

The real danger, Dr. Lowen of Emory said, is if a farmworker becomes infected with both H5N1 and a seasonal flu virus. Flu viruses are adept at swapping genes, so a co-infection would give H5N1 opportunity to gain genes that enable it to spread among people as efficiently as seasonal flu does.

The possibility underscores the importance of vaccinating farmworkers, Dr. Lowen said: �nything we can do to limit seasonal infection in people that are occupationally exposed to H5N1 could really reduce risk.�",NYTimes,yes,no,"The article reports that an older version of the H5N1 virus circulating in Asia has killed about half of those infected, indicating a high human mortality rate.

"Opinion: With the threat of H5N1 bird flu, hospitals must stay prepared",1718668800000,"A third case of mammal-to-human transmission of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus has been reported in the United States. This latest case, involving a dairy worker in Michigan, raises concerns due to the individual exhibiting respiratory symptoms, highlighting the pandemic potential of this virus. U.S. hospitals need to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

The three human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. �he first one in Texas and the others in Michigan �re not connected to each other. Fortunately, all three individuals experienced mild symptoms and have fully recovered, with no additional cases detected. These infections are part of a broader epidemic affecting dairy cattle, with more than 90 herds infected across 12 states. Wastewater surveillance has shown increased detections of influenza A in certain areas. Bird flu is in the family of influenza A so any increase observed can be implicated with H5N1 or other influenza A viruses, such as H1N1 and H3N2 that routinely circulate in people. While there is yet no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus, this could emerge at any time, underscoring the urgent need for hospitals to bolster their preparedness for potential additional human cases of H5N1. The current risk to the general public is low, though individuals with job-related or recreational exposure to infected birds, cattle, or other animals are at higher risk for infection. To date, no severe illness or deaths from H5N1 have been reported in the U.S., though the virus is known to be deadly. Since the first human outbreak in 1997 in Hong Kong, more than 900 sporadic cases have been reported in 23 countries, with more than half resulting in death. As leaders in health care and public health, we recognize the important role hospitals play in outbreak detection and response, and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. With H5N1 posing a potentially significant public health threat, hospitals must adopt proactive, comprehensive strategies to prepare for, reduce the threat of, and respond to potential cases. Here are four strategies we recommend hospitals implement: Actively check people for H5N1 infection Testing is the first step in detecting and managing people with H5N1 bird flu. Clinicians should consider testing people showing signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness or conjunctivitis with relevant exposure history, especially anyone who has had contact with potentially infected sick or dead birds, livestock, or other animals within 10 days of the onset of symptoms. Clinical presentations can range from mild conjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. FURTHER READING Go deeper: H5N1 bird flu Here are the bird flu questions top scientists would like to see answered. Michigan is doing more bird flu testing than any other state. Will others follow? Producing a H5N1 vaccine is more complicated than you might think. And the world would need a lot of it. And finally, an important avian flu precaution: Don't drink raw milk. It is crucial for clinicians to understand that cases of H5N1 bird flu can occur without any known links to infected animals, animal products, or contaminated sources (such as equipment), so it’s important to test individuals who exhibit H5N1 symptoms, regardless of their exposure history. Public health authorities, who control whether testing for H5N1 should be conducted at a public health laboratory, should be flexible and allow clinicians to test patients for H5N1 based on their own clinical judgement and who may not fit the specific criteria for H5N1 — like being in direct contact with an infected animal — as the risk for being infected with H5N1 is evolving. Strengthen communication and coordination with local public health partners Through the national and state Influenza Surveillance Report currently in place, hospitals, clinics, and community providers are essential for public health surveillance for seasonal influenza, including detecting novel strains like H5N1. Identifying various viral subtypes is typically done in public health laboratories. As such, effective communication and coordination between clinicians and local health departments are crucial for diagnosing and managing human H5N1 cases. Increased awareness of H5N1 among clinicians is important for recognizing potential infections in humans and initiating public health investigations. For individuals directly exposed to dairy cows, birds, or other animals that can carry H5N1, or those in at-risk groups, clinicians should be thinking H5N1 if there are signs, symptoms, and a positive influenza A test and immediately contact their local public health departments for subtyping. All hospitals have the ability to test for influenza A, since this family of viruses includes the normally circulating flu strains they see every flu season. Individuals who do not have obvious exposure to H5N1 but have flu strains that are not H1N1 or H3N2, the typical seasonal flu strains, should be evaluated for H5N1 at public health laboratories. Testing for other causes of acute respiratory illness, including SARS-CoV-2, should also be considered based on local epidemiology of circulating respiratory viruses. Related: In dribs and drabs, USDA reports suggest containing bird flu outbreak in dairy cows will be challenging Educate health care workers Health care workers are the frontline defenders in responding to outbreaks, acting as public health eyes and ears in the fight against infectious diseases. Their preparedness is vital for public health. To ensure effective monitoring and response to potential H5N1 cases, all clinicians must be educated on CDC guidelines for identifying infections, initiating antiviral treatment, and notifying health departments for testing. Training should cover H5N1 criteria and definition of risk factors for infection with H5N1, proper notification procedures to the health department to initiate testing, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent transmission. Early identification of infections is essential to control spread and protect health care workers. The CDC’s updated webpage is a valuable resource for current outbreak information. Incorporate public education and outreach Public education is vital for a hospital’s preparedness strategy. While the CDC states the current risk to the general public from H5N1 is low, preventive measures are essential, especially with the increased consumption of raw milk, a potential means of transmission. Public recommendations include avoiding contact with infected or dead animals and potentially contaminated surfaces or equipment, using PPE when necessary, and avoiding undercooked or raw foods such as unpasteurized milk. Hospitals should engage in community outreach to disseminate this information and encourage individuals to seek medical care if they suspect an infection. The emergence of an H5N1 bird flu epidemic in the U.S. highlights the persistent threat of this virus. Hospitals must beef up their preparedness by implementing robust screening protocols, strengthening communication with public health partners, educating health care workers, and engaging in public outreach. These steps support the public health response to H5N1 and mitigate risks. Ongoing vigilance and readiness are crucial to protecting public health and health care workers.

"U.S. is 'flying blind' with bird flu, repeating mistakes of COVID, health experts say",1719187200000,"It's been nearly three months since the U.S. government announced an outbreak of the bird flu virus on dairy farms. The World Health Organization considers the virus a public health concern because of its potential to cause a pandemic, yet the U.S. has tested only about 45 people across the country. ""We're flying blind,"" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. With so few tests run, she said, it's impossible to know how many farmworkers have been infected, or how serious the disease is. A lack of testing means the country might not notice if the virus begins to spread between people � the gateway to another pandemic. ""We'd like to be doing more testing. There's no doubt about that,"" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC's bird flu test is the only one the Food and Drug Administration right now. Shah said the agency has distributed these tests to about 100 public health labs in states. ""We've got roughly a million available now,"" he said, ""and expect 1.2 million more in the next two months."" But Nuzzo and other researchers are concerned because the CDC and public health labs aren't generally where doctors order tests from. That job tends to be done by major clinical laboratories run by companies and universities, which lack authorization for bird flu testing. Clinical labs say they're 'stuck on the bench' As the outbreak grows � with at least infected in 12 states as of June 18 � researchers said the CDC and FDA are not moving fast enough to remove barriers that block clinical labs from testing. In one case, the diagnostics company Neelyx Labs was on hold with a query for more than a month. ""Clinical labs are part of the nation's public health system,"" said Alex Greninger, assistant director of the University of Washington Medicine Clinical Virology Laboratory. ""Pull us into the game. We're stuck on the bench."" The CDC recognized the need for clinical labs in a . It calls on industry to develop tests for the H5 strain of bird flu virus, the one circulating among dairy cattle. ""The limited availability and accessibility of diagnostic tests for Influenza A(H5) poses several pain points,"" the CDC wrote. The points include a shortage of tests if demand spikes. Researchers, including former CDC director Tom Frieden and , who led the nation's response to COVID, cite as a key reason the U.S. fared so poorly with COVID. Had COVID tests been widely available in early 2020, they say, the U.S. could have detected many cases before they turned into outbreaks that prompted business shutdowns and cost lives. In published this month, Nuzzo and a group of colleagues noted that the problem wasn't testing capability but a failure to deploy that capability swiftly. The U.S. reported excess mortality eight times as high as other countries with advanced labs and other technological advantages. A COVID test vetted by the WHO was available by . Rather than use it, the United States stuck to its own multistage process, which took several months. Namely, the CDC develops its own test then sends it to local public health labs. Eventually, the FDA authorizes tests from clinical diagnostic labs that serve hospital systems, which must then scale up their operations. That took time, and people died amid outbreaks at nursing homes and prisons, waiting on test results. In contrast, South Korea immediately rolled out testing through private sector laboratories, allowing it to keep schools and businesses open. ""They said, 'Gear up, guys; we're going to need a ton of tests,'"" said Frieden, now president of the public health organization Resolve to Save Lives. ""You need to get commercials in the game."" Nuzzo and her colleagues describe a step-by-step strategy for rolling out testing in health emergencies, in response to mistakes made obvious by COVID. But in this bird flu outbreak, the U.S. is weeks behind that playbook. Ample testing is critical for two reasons. First, people need to know if they're infected so that they can be quickly treated, Nuzzo said. Over the past two decades, roughly half of about 900 people around the globe known to have gotten the bird flu died from it. Although the three farmworkers diagnosed with the disease this year in the United States had only mild symptoms, like a runny nose and inflamed eyes, others may not be so lucky. The flu treatment Tamiflu works only when given soon after symptoms start. The CDC and local health departments have tried to boost bird flu testing among farmworkers, asking them to be tested if they feel sick. list several reasons why their outreach efforts are failing. The outreach might not be in the languages the farmworkers speak, for example, or address such concerns as a loss of employment. If people who live and work around farms simply see a doctor when they or their children fall ill, those cases could be missed if the doctors send samples to their usual clinical laboratories. The CDC has asked doctors to send samples from people with flu symptoms who have exposure to livestock or poultry to public health labs. ""If you work on a farm with an outbreak and you're worried about your welfare, you can get tested,"" Shah said. But sending samples to public health departments requires knowledge, time, and effort. ""I really worry about a testing scheme in which busy clinicians need to figure this out,"" Nuzzo said. Labs ask for 'right to reference' but federal agencies' response is slow The other reason to involve clinical laboratories is so the nation can ramp up testing if the bird flu is suddenly detected among people who didn't catch it from cattle. There's no evidence the virus has started to spread among people, but that could change The fastest way to get clinical labs involved, Greninger said, is to allow them to use a test the FDA has already authorized: the CDC's bird flu test. On April 16 the CDC opened up that possibility by offering royalty-free licenses for components of its bird flu tests to accredited labs. Several commercial labs asked for licenses. ""We want to get prepared before things get crazy,"" said Shyam Saladi, chief executive officer of the diagnostics company Neelyx Labs, which offered COVID and mpox tests during shortages in those outbreaks. His experience over the past two months reveals the types of barriers that prevent labs from moving swiftly. In email exchanges with the CDC, shared with KFF Health News, Saladi specifies the labs' desire for licenses relevant to the CDC's test, as well as a ""right to reference"" the CDC's data in its application for FDA authorization. That ""right to reference"" makes it easier for one company to use a test developed by another. It allows the new group to skip certain analyses conducted by the original maker, by telling the FDA to look at data in the original FDA application. This was commonplace with COVID tests at the peak of the pandemic. At first, the CDC appeared eager to cooperate. ""A right of reference to the data should be available,"" Jonathan Motley, a patent specialist at the CDC, wrote in an email to Saladi on April 24. Over the next few weeks, the CDC sent him information about transferring its licenses to the company, and about the test, which prompted Neelyx's researchers to buy testing components and try out the CDC's process on their equipment. But Saladi grew increasingly anxious about the ability to reference the CDC's data in the company's FDA application. ""Do you have an update with respect to the right of reference?"" he asked the CDC on May 13. ""If there are any potential sticking points with respect to this, would you mind letting us know please?"" He asked several more times in the following weeks, as the number of herds infected with the bird flu ticked upward and more cases among farmworkers were announced. ""Given that it is May 24 and the outbreak has only expanded, can CDC provide a date by which it plans to respond?"" Saladi wrote. The CDC eventually signed a licensing agreement with Neelyx but informed Saladi that it would not, in fact, provide the reference. Without that, Saladi said, he could not move forward with the CDC's test � at least not without more material from the agency. ""It's really frustrating,"" he said. ""We thought they really intended to support the development of these tests in case they are needed."" Shah, from the CDC, said test manufacturers should generate their own data to prove that they're using the CDC's test correctly. ""We don't have a shortage such that we need to cut corners,"" he said. ""Quality reigns supreme."" The CDC has given seven companies, including Neelyx, licenses for its tests � although none have been cleared to use them by the FDA. Only one of those companies asked for the right of reference, Shah said. The labs may be assisted by additional material that the agency is developing now, to allow them to complete the analyses � even without the reference. ""This should have happened sooner,"" Saladi told KFF Health News when he was told about the CDC's pending additional material . ""There's been no communication about this."" Flashback to early COVID response Greninger said the delays and confusion are reminiscent of the early months of COVID, when federal agencies prioritized caution over speed. Test accuracy is important, he said, but excessive vetting can cause harm in a fastmoving outbreak like this one. ""The CDC should be trying to open this up to labs with national reach and a good reputation,"" he said. ""I fall on the side of allowing labs to get ready � that's a no-brainer."" Clinical laboratories have also begun to develop their own tests from scratch. But researchers said they're moving cautiously because of a recent that gives the agency more oversight of lab-developed tests, lengthening the pathway to approval. In an email to KFF Health News, FDA press officer Janell Goodwin said the rule's enforcement will occur gradually. However, Susan Van Meter, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, a trade group whose members include the nation's largest commercial diagnostic labs, said companies need more clarity: ""It's slowing things down because it's adding to the confusion about what is allowable."" Creating tests for the bird flu is already a risky bet because demand is uncertain. It's not clear whether this outbreak in cattle will trigger an epidemic or fizzle out. In addition to issues with the CDC and FDA, clinical laboratories are trying to figure out whether health will pay for bird flu tests. These wrinkles will be smoothed eventually. Until then, the vanishingly slim numbers of people tested, along with the lack of testing in cattle, may draw criticism from other parts of the world. ""Think about our judgment of China's transparency at the start of COVID,"" Nuzzo said. ""The current situation undermines America's standing in the world."" is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF�an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

"Covid Changed Everything, Including How We Cover the Bird Flu",1719187200000,"The Times� science and global health reporter shared how the pandemic shaped her current reporting on viruses, including bird flu, which is seeing an uptick in cases.

Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.

Many of the scientists Apoorva Mandavilli spoke to seemed convinced of the same thing: The bird flu virus, called H5N1, could cause the world� next pandemic.

That was in 2002. And though H5N1, which first surfaced in 1996, did not immediately become as widespread as once feared, it never went away. Since 2003, H5N1 has infected nearly 900 people around the world, about half of whom died of their illness.

In the two decades since she began covering bird flu, Ms. Mandavilli, a science and global health reporter for The New York Times, has reported on a number of infectious diseases, such as Covid-19 and mpox, previously known as monkeypox, as well as scourges like H.I.V., tuberculosis and malaria.

Recently, she� turned her attention back to H5N1, which is rapidly gaining new hosts, having made the leap from birds to various mammals, including dairy cows. According to public health authorities, three farmworkers in the United States, all of whom worked with dairy cows, became infected this spring with mostly mild symptoms.

In an interview, Ms. Mandavilli shared how the Covid pandemic has changed the way she covers viruses, including H5N1, and what we need to know about the current bird flu outbreak. This interview has been edited and condensed.

How does H5N1 compare with other viruses or infectious diseases you�e reported on over your career?

It� a bit of a slower burn, and you don� know where it� going quite yet. With Covid, we were thrust into the middle of a big crisis. Things like measles or H.I.V. are ongoing. And H5N1 has been around for quite a while. I started reporting on it in 2002. It� sort of been a distant threat: �aybe it�l happen.�

This particular clade �r family of viruses �tarted in 2020. It was killing all these different birds and poultry. Since then, we�e seen it in all kinds of mammals: foxes, raccoons, bears, mice, goats, sea lions, mink. It� not the kind of thing that everyone needs to start panicking about, but knowing the potential for what this virus can do, it� also not something we can ignore.

How, if at all, did the coronavirus pandemic, and your coverage of it, change how you approach reporting on viruses?

Covid influenced everything. If you� asked me before Covid if the world was prepared for a pandemic, I would have said, �arts of the world are prepared, and parts are not.�nd I would have included the United States and Britain in the parts that were prepared. Then we saw what happened. Now, I� aware of all the blind spots and all the things that can go wrong. When there� an outbreak �nd this happened with mpox, too �mmediately, I� laser-focused on, �hat are they doing about this?�

Can you elaborate on what some of those things are?

One is vaccine development. Do we have a vaccine ready to go? Obviously with Covid, we didn�, but with mpox, we did. But there were all these production issues with it. There was confusion at every level. Another is interagency communication. The current outbreak in dairy cattle requires three agencies to work together. The U.S.D.A., the C.D.C., the F.D.A. are all involved. And they don� talk to one another well, which may be the case with any zoonotic outbreak. The F.D.A. regulates milk and milk products. And the C.D.C. worries about human infections.

In this outbreak, the C.D.C. is doing OK. But the U.S.D.A., which oversees farms, livestock and meat products, seems to be confused. I don� think they are used to this level of attention, this level of scrutiny.

Why is it so important to shed light on the lack of communication between agencies?

It matters in terms of policy. If the right lawmakers pay attention, it could change things. It could make all the difference between this blowing up and it staying contained. We saw that with mpox.

It especially matters to the people who are affected. The ones who are most at risk are farmworkers. We should talk about how we can protect them. Right now, the farms are not testing people actively. They�e not testing cows actively. Nothing is mandatory; it� all voluntary.

How do you balance the need for direct and accurate reporting with a responsibility not to spread unnecessary fear?

We always think about the readers. What do they need to know?

This is something that people should know about. But at the same time, you don� want them to panic. One way I�e done it is to quote some expert saying: �his is something I need to worry about and all the people I talk to have to worry about, but not necessarily something you need to worry about.�

Based on your reporting, how worried do you think the public should be about H5N1?

There are all these things we don� know. H5N1 infections have not always been mild. The virus is changing and we don� know exactly how or when it might be able to spread among people. Every expert I know is wary. The profusion of hosts has made a lot of my sources very nervous. It� most adaptive to birds, but it� shown itself capable of infecting a wide range of animals, which is unusual. We�e now seen mammal-to-mammal transmission. It probably is capable at some point of getting to human-to-human transmission. We just don� know if or when it will get there.",NYTimes,yes,no,"The article reports that about half of the nearly 900 people infected with H5N1 have died, indicating a high human mortality rate.

Is New York Prepared for a  Bird Flu  Pandemic?,1719273600000,"The health care system has stockpiles of medicine and has worked out � lot of the kinks�ince the Covid pandemic. But experts still have some concerns about a bird flu outbreak.

Four years after a new coronavirus swept through New York in what was called a once-in-a-century event, public health officials are beginning to prepare for the possibility that a far worse pandemic is on its way.

The bird flu virus, H5N1, is not spreading among people. But the city is already preparing as if it could.

It is considering plans to set up isolation and quarantine hotels. One New York City hospital system is taking steps to start testing its sewage for the virus, so that it will know if bird flu is silently circulating among patients and staff.

But some epidemiologists worry that once again, the public health response in New York will be too sluggish in the early phases, should an epidemic break out in the city.

The virus has worried epidemiologists for its pandemic potential even before the first human patients were detected in Hong Kong in 1997. In the years since then, it has spread via migratory birds and periodically torn through chicken farms. Fewer than 1,000 people are known to have been infected in the past 20 years. But slightly more than half of those infected have died.

Now the disease has been found in herds of dairy cattle in 12 U.S. states. Human-to-human transmission has not yet been detected, but the worry is that the virus could evolve.

�here is still a huge amount of uncertainty about when it will jump to human-to-human transmission,�aid Dr. Jay Varma, a former epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who helped guide New York City� response during the Covid pandemic.

His guess: maybe months, maybe years.

How exposed is New York City?

New York City �isited by some 50 million Americans annually �ould well be among the first U.S. cities to be hard hit if a bird flu pandemic breaks out among people, as it was when the novel coronavirus arrived.

But for now, it is far from the front lines. Though New York is one of the nation� leading dairy-producing states, the virus does not appear to be circulating among its cattle. The state� agricultural department has imposed a number of testing requirements. Last week it announced mandatory H5N1 tests for dairy cattle appearing at county fairs.

Would there be tests to determine who has bird flu?

Epidemiologists fear a worrisome repeat of the early days of Covid-19, when only narrow categories of people �uch as travelers returning from China, or their contacts �were eligible for testing. Other New Yorkers struggled to get tested. As a result, public health authorities were slow to detect the virus �r to act.

At present, there is no readily available H5N1 test in wide supply outside government laboratories. The tests that doctors�ffices and hospitals rely on do not distinguish H5N1 from some seasonal flus, if the tests detect it at all. For now, only people with specific risk factors �uch as those who have been around sick farm animals or birds �re likely to have their samples immediately referred to government public health laboratories for H5N1 testing.

Without better diagnostics, the virus �ould fly under the radar for some time,�rof. Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said.

State authorities said they were not worried about testing. The state� public health laboratory �as more than sufficient testing capacity for H5N1 �everal hundred specimens per day �nd substantial additional surge capacity if needed,� spokeswoman for the Health Department, Erin Clary, said.

But what the government should do, according to epidemiologists, is encourage and authorize commercial and university laboratories to develop H5N1 tests, so that government public health laboratories would not become a bottleneck.

Wastewater surveillance could also help. A research team is working to set up an H5N1-specific test for wastewater samples at four of the city� 11 public hospitals. If the virus was detected, it would most likely mean a patient, staff member or visitor was infected, said Prof. Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at CUNY� School of Public Health, who is part of the team on the project.

Does New York have enough vaccines and antivirals?

Public health authorities have been planning for a deadly influenza pandemic for decades. Federal health officials have identified two vaccine viruses that they hope will prove effective against a pandemic H5N1 strain.

The number of vaccine doses in the national stockpile is under a million, though 4.8 million more doses have been ordered. If it becomes necessary, federal officials are optimistic that, within 130 days, manufacturers could make more than 100 million doses �nough for more than 50 million people.

During the Covid pandemic, children were vaccinated last. But small children are especially vulnerable to the flu and would most likely be prioritized in an influenza pandemic.

The federal government has also amassed a huge stockpile of influenza antivirals. New York has its own stockpile apart from the federal one, and the city and its public hospital system also have their own �n all, enough for more than 10 percent of the state� population.

Are hospitals ready to care for patients with bird flu?

Doctors in the city� public hospital system expressed confidence that it could handle an influenza pandemic without the health care system collapsing.

In interviews, doctors noted that the Covid pandemic had taught valuable lessons, such as how to rapidly build makeshift ICUs and the importance of trying to avoid intubating patients where possible.

� lot of the kinks have been worked out,�aid Dr. David Silvestri, an emergency room physician in the South Bronx who oversees emergency planning for the public hospital system. �n an absolute worst-case scenario, we could pull on all the same levers.�

Will there be lockdowns and school closures?

If H5N1 sparks a pandemic, public health experts said to expect a return to social distancing and lockdowns, especially if the fatality rates are as high as feared.

�hat will be the reality and that� what slows down transmission,�aid Dr. Bruce Farber, an infectious disease doctor with Northwell Health, the state� largest hospital system. �ust because we�e tired of pandemics and don� want to be thinking about another, that doesn� mean the viruses care,�e added.

What can I do to protect myself and my family?

Professor Krammer, an influenza expert, said he did not think the next pandemic was �mminent.�ut, he added, �on� get me wrong �t� not a good situation.�

Experts have advised people to take some basic precautions in the meantime.

In recent years, raw milk, as unpasteurized milk is called, has been rising in popularity from Brooklyn to Iowa. But cows�dders can be a reservoir of H5N1 virus. The C.D.C. advises drinking pasteurized milk.

Experts also advised staying away from wild birds and making sure pets steer clear of them, too.",NYTimes,yes,no,"The article reports that slightly more than half of the infected people have died, indicating a high human mortality rate.

"Pasteurization Kills Bird Flu Virus in Milk, New Studies Confirm",1719878400000,"Pasteurization�he process of using high heat to eliminate harmful microbes in foods�ffectively kills the H5N1 avian influenza virus that is currently circulating in U.S. cattle. In a new study scientists at the Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture pasteurized raw milk inoculated with high concentrations of the pathogen and found that the treatment inactivated it in all samples. The finding validates that this century-and-a-half-old technique can protect humans from infectious microbes. Both agencies recommend that people should not consume raw (unpasteurized) milk or raw milk products.

Concerns over the safety of dairy products have risen with reports of bird flu outbreaks at dairy cow farms in multiple states. As of June 28, there have been three human cases of avian flu in the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All identified cases were in dairy farm workers who had direct contact with infected cattle. The FDA and USDA had previously sampled retail dairy products that had been commercially pasteurized, about 20 percent of which contained H5N1 viral particles. None of the 297 samples�hich came from 132 processing sites in 38 states and were collected from April 18 to 22�ontained live infectious virus, however. (The results of the sampling study were initially released in May, prior to its upcoming publication in the Journal of Virology.)

The most common commercial dairy treatment process is high-temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurization, also called �lash pasteurization,�hich involves rapidly churning raw milk through large tanks at a temperature of at least 161 degrees Fahrenheit (72 degrees Celsius) for approximately three to 15 seconds before it� cooled. This kills most harmful pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. The new pasteurization study, which the FDA released on its site on June 28, replicated real-world pasteurization conditions to see how effective the process is at killing the currently circulating H5N1 strain in milk. The paper has been submitted to the Journal of Food Protection but has not yet been published.

The researchers collected raw milk samples from farms in states with known outbreaks. The average concentration of viable H5N1 in positive samples was about 3,000 viral particles per milliliter. The team then artificially contaminated homogenized, raw whole milk with even higher viral concentrations�bout five million viral particles per milliliter�nd treated the samples in a HTST continuous-flow pasteurization system similar to those used by the dairy industry. The system pumped the milk through two heating chambers: the first preheated it to 100 degrees F (38 degrees C), and the second brought it to 162.5 degrees F (72.5 degrees C) before holding it in a tube at 161 degrees F (72 degrees C). After about 15 seconds of that high heat, the liquid was transferred to a separate tank to cool.

Pasteurization completely inactivated the virus in all of the tested samples. This was true even when the team checked on the milk midway through the process, before it went into the holding tube. The researchers predict that pasteurization may be effective at killing as many as one trillion viral particles per milliliter.

�alidating the effectiveness of the pasteurization parameters critically demonstrates that commercial milk processing is capable of controlling the ... virus and further provides broad assurance that pasteurized milk and dairy products made from pasteurized milk are safe,�aid Nathan Anderson, a co-author of the study and director of the Division of Food Processing Science and Technology at the FDA� Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, in a recent press release.

At last week� meeting of the CDC� Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, agency researchers presented an update on the state of avian influenza surveillance in the U.S. Data so far indicate that the risk of H5N1 infection in the general public is low. But the CDC recommends people who come into close, prolonged contact with infected animals should take safety precautions, such as wearing a face mask, a face shield or goggles and disposable coveralls. The agency says its scientists are actively monitoring the situation and collaborating with the FDA, the USDA and state public health departments. Currently H5N1 has been detected in cattle in 132 dairy herds across 12 states.

H5N1 isn� a new threat; it� been present in bird populations since 1996. The pathogen has since been detected in a growing number of mammals, including cats, dogs, goats and seals. The currently circulating version of the virus emerged in 2020 from migratory wild aquatic birds, first resulting in outbreaks in poultry in 2022 before being detected in cattle this year.

"If bird flu sparks a human pandemic, your past immunity could help",1720483200000,"Older populations might be more protected than younger ones because of exposure to �atched�trains during childhood, but an H5N1 pandemic is likely to take a major toll all the same.

As the  H5N1 bird-flu virus spreads relentlessly in animalsaround the world, researchers seeking to understand how a human  H5N1 pandemic might unfold have turned to a rich source of clues: data on the immune system� response to influenza.

Such information provides hints about who could be most vulnerable in an H5N1 pandemic. Previous research also suggests that, in a confrontation with the virus, our immune systems would not be starting from scratch �hanks to previous infections with, and vaccinations against, other forms of flu. But this immunity is unlikely to prevent H5N1 from inflicting serious damage to global health, if a pandemic were to begin.

From feathers to fur

The  H5N1 strain now running rampant began as a bird pathogen before branching out to mammals. Classified as a �ighly pathogenic�irus for its lethality in birds, it has killed millions of domestic and wild birds around the world since it first emerged in 1996.1 It has also spread to a growing list of mammal species, including seals and foxes, and has caused more than 460 human deaths since 2003.

So far, the virus has not gained the ability to spread effectively between people, which has kept the potential for a pandemic at bay. But its repeated jumps from birds to mammals and evidence of transmission among mammals, such as elephant seals (Mirounga leonina)2, have alarmed researchers, who warn that the virus is gaining opportunities to become adept at spreading easily between people.

These worries were magnified when  H5N1 was detected in March for the first time in US cattle �nimals that interact frequently with humans. As of 8 July, US health officials have confirmed bird-flu infections in nearly 140 dairy herds in 12 states and in 4 dairy farm workers.

All of the workers had mild symptoms, but scientists caution that the virus is still a threat. It� possible that the workers escaped severe illness because they might have caught  H5N1 through exposure to milk from infected cows rather than the usual airborne particles, says Seema Lakdawala, an influenza virologist at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. Or perhaps it� because the workers might have been infected through the eye rather than the typical route of the mouth or nose.

Malik Peiris, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, says he is not surprised by these infections, �or reassured that mildness of these cases means that this virus is inherently mild�

Immune preparedness

The virus� inherent virulence isn� the only factor that would shape a pandemic, Peiris says. Another is the immune system� state of readiness.

Through a combination of past infection and immunization, by the time people reach adulthood, they have generally had considerable exposure to flu. Some estimates3 suggest that up to half of younger populations are infected annually with �easonal�lu viruses, which cause regular waves of infections.

Flu and colds are back with a vengeance �hy now?

But exposure to seasonal flu offers limited protection against the new flu strains that could cause pandemics. These strains are genetically distinct from circulating seasonal strains, meaning that they face less built-up immunity in humans and can thus be more dangerous.

For now, H5N1 does not spread easily between people. But scientists worry that if it gains that ability, it could spark a pandemic, given that it is genetically different from seasonal flu viruses now in circulation. Tests of people across the United States found that few have antibodies against today� strain of  H5N1. This implies that �ost of the population would be susceptible to infection from this virus if it were to start infecting people easily� according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which ran the tests.

Good news, bad news

That doesn� leave people completely unprotected, because exposure to an older pandemic flu strain can defend against a newer one, says Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. For example, in a 2009 pandemic caused by the swine-flu virus H1N1, 80% of deaths were in people younger than 654. Older generations were spared owing to immunity stemming from exposure to different H1N1 strains when they were younger.

Exposure to H1N1 during the 2009 pandemic and at other times might, in turn, provide some protection against the H5N1 strain on the rise today. Both the H5N1 and H1N1 viruses have a surface protein designated N1, and an immune system that responds to H1N1 might also respond to H5N1. Peiris and his colleagues found that the near-universal exposure to H1N1 in 2009 and subsequent years produces antibodies that respond to H5N1 in nearly 97% of the samples they collected5. He is now running animal experiments to determine whether this antibody response confers protection against infection and serious illness.

All-important first flu case

There� yet another complicating factor to the immune response to H5N1: a person� first bout of flu might have an outsized effect on their future immunity. In a 2016 paper6, Worobey and his colleagues analysed almost two decades�orth of severe infections caused by two subtypes of bird flu, H5N1 and H7N9. They found that people are generally unscathed by the flu strain that best �atches�he one that had caused their first childhood flu infection �hereas they are more vulnerable to mismatched strains.

How COVID-19 is changing the cold and flu season

Thus, people born before 1968 have tended to escape H5N1� ravages, because they probably had their first flu infection at a time when the dominant flu virus in circulation matched H5N1. But people born after 1968 eluded the worst of H7N9, because their first encounter with flu was probably with a virus that matched it rather than H5N1. Immunity from a first infection provided 75% protection against severe disease and 80% protection against death with a matching bird-flu virus, the authors found.

If an H5N1 outbreak were to occur, this first-bout effect predicts that older people could once again be largely spared whereas younger people could be more vulnerable, Worobey says. �e should have that somewhere between the back and front of our minds,�e says.

Extreme heat may be crucial factor in human spread of bird flu,1721347200000,"As heatwaves hit the US, farm workers struggle to wear PPE. The country now faces its biggest human outbreak

Extreme heat may be a crucial factor behind the biggest bird flu outbreak in humans in the US as officials continue to track the virus�pread.

A heatwave in Colorado likely caused personal protective equipment not to work correctly for workers culling poultry infected with H5N1, a highly pathogenic bird flu. Four people have tested positive for H5N1 and a fifth is also expected to have their case confirmed as bird flu, officials said this week.

It� the first time a cluster of human cases of bird flu has been reported in the US.

On dairy farms, it has also been difficult for workers to wear PPE, in part because of the heat spreading across much of the US. Colorado confirmed a case of bird flu in a dairy worker earlier this month.

Climate change, which hasbeenlinked to intense heat across the country, can amplify outbreaks of deadly diseases like these, experts say. Climate change has also been linked to the emergence and wider spread of pathogens like these, including new migratory patterns for H5N1-infected wild birds.

�hen you change a global system like climate so profoundly, small shifts can have seismic impacts, sometimes in unexpected ways,�aid Alexandra Phelan, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

In Colorado, the workers were culling a flock of egg-laying chickens that had tested positive for H5N1.

They went bird by bird �atching them, putting them in a cart and killing a few dozen birds at a time with carbon dioxide gas.

�t� a very, very manual �ifficult, laborious process,�ulie Gauthier, from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), said at a press briefing on Tuesday.

And it can be dangerous to work in such close and prolonged quarters with animals infected with bird flu, which has a mortality rate of about 50% among people.

It was 104F (40C) outside, but in the chicken houses, it was even hotter.

Between the sweat and the enormous industrial fans to stave off even higher temperatures, workers couldn� keep their goggles and masks sealed on their faces, Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told reporters. The fans also spread feathers and debris, which can carry the virus aloft, Shah said.

Of the 160 people working on the farm, 60 went on to develop symptoms, and five tested positive or are presumed to be positive. The remaining 55 workers tested negative for H5N1 at the Colorado state health lab, and some of them were diagnosed with other respiratory illnesses. Only symptomatic workers were tested.

�s the epidemiological investigation proceeds, it is important to note that additional cases may be detected,�hah said.

Workers will continue culling the chickens, which make up a flock of 1.8m birds, over the next 10 to 14 days, Eric Deeble, acting senior advisor for H5N1 response at USDA, said at the briefing.

�USDA considers it very important for depopulation to continue to stop virus amplification and shedding, prevent further spread and to reduce the viral load in the environment,�eeble said. �f depopulation were to be paused, workers would still be required to care for and feed animals, prolonging their exposure risk.�

Those involved with culling on the farm �ncluding poultry producers, employees, contractors and USDA employees �re required to wear Tyvek suits, N95 respirators, goggles, boots and gloves while working with infected chickens.

Upon detecting possible cases in people, Colorado immediately alerted the CDC, which dispatched a team of 10 experts �ncluding an industrial hygienist to work on procedures to reduce exposure risks for the workers as they continue to handle infected chickens, Shah said.

The CDC and the state of Colorado �ave been joined at the hip� Shah said �n contrast to other outbreaks at farms around the country, where the CDC typically has had limited access to affected animals and people.

The poultry operation is in the same county as dairy herds that have tested positive for bird flu.

Genomic sequencing shows that these cases are closely related to the outbreak in dairy cows; it seems to have jumped from cows to chickens to people, though it� not clear how at this point. A USDA report from Michigan last month found the virus may be transported by people between farms.

Climate change can negatively affect human health, making people more vulnerable to extreme weather and spillover events like these, and it remakes animal interactions and migration patterns that can lead to more spillover.

In fact, it may be responsible for the H5N1 outbreak in the Americas.

In late 2021, wild birds carrying the virus managed to fly from northern Europe to Iceland and then to Newfoundland.

�ne reason it happened is because of unusually strong winds,�aid Jean-Pierre Vaillancourt, a professor of veterinary medicine at University of Montreal. It� �ery unusual�or the birds to be able to travel that far, �ut when this happened, we had really unusual climate conditions� he said.

�t� not just the extreme heat. It� the fact that you have unusual climate events,�aid Vaillancourt. �t may disrupt usual migratory patterns�nd other human and animal behaviors, opening new avenues of risk.

These are the first cases in US poultry workers since 2022, when an inmate tested positive after culling infected chickens in Colorado.

The five workers in 2024 reported conjunctivitis (or �ink eye� and teary eyes, as well as more typical flu symptoms, like fever, chills, coughing and a sore throat, said Shah. None of them required hospitalization, and they are all recovering, he said.

The CDC has not changed its risk assessment for the general public or its policies for addressing the farm outbreaks, including recommendations on vaccines.

�DC is not recommending H5 specific vaccine for livestock workers, given the mild symptoms that have been noted thus far, in the absence of any changes to the virus� genetic makeup,�hah said.

Vaccines for cows are also being studied.

�e do believe that we can eliminate this within the dairy herds,�eeble said.

�nhanced biosecurity would get us to a point where we can arrest the spread, and hopefully in the future, we may get a vaccine which can further facilitate the elimination of this disease from the national herds,�e said.

Officials need to keep climate considerations top of mind in responding to �nd potentially eliminating �iruses like these, Phelan said. �cross all areas, governments need to actively and urgently incorporate climate considerations into all health and safety measures more than simply at the surface level.�",Guardian,yes,yes,"The article reports a human mortality rate of about 50% for bird flu.

New York� Preparations for a  Bird Flu  Pandemic Rely on a Single Drug,1722211200000,"New York State� stockpile of antiviral medications for flu contains only one drug, Tamiflu, leaving no fallback plan. New York� plan for confronting bird flu if it begins spreading among people relies heavily on a vast stockpile of flu treatment medicine. But experts worry the stockpile is missing a key tool. New York has only one type of flu antiviral drug, Tamiflu, which might prove less effective than hoped against a pandemic strain of bird flu, some experts say. There is another antiviral that might work, even if Tamiflu doesn� � drug called baloxavir marboxil. And yet the state has not stored a single dose of it in case of emergency. �here could be an Achilles�eel here,�aid Dr. Sean T. Liu, an infectious disease expert at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Given the uncertainty about how bird flu might evolve and what treatments might ultimately work best, some public health experts worry that New York might have too much riding on a single drug, when an alternative is available. �t is always wise, when there are unknown variables, to have more than one therapeutic option in your toolbox,�aid Dr. Howard Zucker, the former state health commissioner, who led the Health Department during the coronavirus pandemic and oversaw the state� epidemic stockpile until 2021. The next pandemic, some experts worry, could land soon in the form of H5N1, a flu virus that has long circulated in wild birds, occasionally causing outbreaks at poultry farms. The virus can infect people who come into contact with diseased birds and has killed about half of the 1,000 or so people known to have contracted it. It has shown little ability to spread from one person to another, but it has begun jumping to mammals, a worrisome development. Late last year it began spreading among dairy cattle, infecting herds from Texas to Michigan. Public health officials have long prepared for the possibility that it might one day be able to transmit efficiently from human to human. In New York, state health authorities have stockpiled ventilators and amassed enough Tamiflu for about 10 percent of the state� population. The federal government and New York City also have their own stockpiles. The state bought the Tamiflu more than 15 years ago, when it was the obvious choice as the leading flu antiviral. But in 2018, a promising new flu drug entered the market: baloxavir marboxil, which is marketed as Xofluza. There is no way of knowing how effective either drug would be against a pandemic flu strain that has not yet evolved. Tamiflu could work well, but it might not. The same goes for baloxavir. Some versions of H5N1 circulating have mutations that make them resistant to Tamiflu, and baloxavir works differently. When the flu virus infects a cell, it hijacks the cell� machinery to churn out new virus particles. Tamiflu targets the viral enzyme that allows newly formed virus particles to break loose from the infected cell. That limits their ability to infect new cells. Baloxavir blocks a different enzyme and prevents viral replication within the host cell. During a flu pandemic, antiviral medications could mean the difference between life and death for those infected �specially in the first wave before a vaccine is available. A Health Department spokeswoman, Erin Clary, noted that baloxavir is expensive, often $180 at a pharmacy. It is unclear whether other states have purchased it in bulk as part of their pandemic response plans. �tockpiling a costly drug that is not recommended by the C.D.C. is financially irresponsible,�he said, adding that oseltamivir �he generic form of Tamiflu �s the �rimary recommended antiviral�or bird flu. The C.D.C.recommendations that Ms. Clary cited, however, are guidance for doctors regarding what drugs and dosages to use, not instructions for how public health authorities should prepare for the unknown. Dr. Liu of Mount Sinai, who treated Covid-19 patients and previously worked on developing a universal flu vaccine, noted that some viruses are best treated with a cocktail of drugs, rather than with just one. In interviews, several doctors said that in a flu pandemic, they might want the option of treating patients with both Tamiflu and baloxavir at once. �f it were me and I got H5N1 right now and I was terribly sick, I would definitely ask for a combination of two things,�r. Liu said. Baloxavir is not in New York� stockpile of antiviral medications for a variety of reasons. In the mid-2000s, as the federal government built up its own stockpile of Tamiflu, it offered to subsidize states�fforts to do the same. New York bought 2,029,721 courses of Tamiflu manufactured in 2006 and 2007. Baloxavir was not approved for use until 2018. At that time, a committee of federal scientists recommended ordering eight million courses of baloxavir for the federal stockpile, said Dr. Rick Bright, who at the time headed the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a federal agency involved in disaster preparations. There was a pressing need to �iversify�he medications in the stockpile, Dr. Bright recalled. But higher-ups ignored this recommendation and opted for more Tamiflu, he said. The patent for Tamiflu had expired in 2016 and the generic form of the drug �seltamivir �ecame available and was relatively cheap. Dr. Bright filed a whistle-blower complaint in 2020, in part over the Trump administration� Covid-19 response, but also criticizing federal officials for their decision to forgo baloxavir. The complaint claims that �olitical connections and cronyism�layed a role in pharmaceutical contracts for the federal stockpile. The contract for the generic form of Tamiflu was awarded to a pharmaceutical company that was represented by a favored consultant who seemed to have an �utsized role�n contracting decisions, according to the whistle-blower complaint. At the time, the consultant issued a statement in which he �nequivocally�enied wrongdoing and said Dr. Bright� allegations were false. A spokesman for the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which oversees the stockpile, declined to comment on the specifics of Dr. Bright� complaint, noting that his concerns related to the prior presidential administration. The spokesman, Spencer Pretecrum, said his agency had sought to �uild a diverse inventory of medical countermeasures in the Strategic National Stockpile that most efficiently and broadly protect against a range of potential pathogens.� The federal government has since added between 500,000 and one million courses of baloxavir to its stockpile, according to Mr. Pretecrum, the agency spokesman. He said future orders were anticipated. But in New York, the Health Department has shown little interest in adding baloxavir to its stockpile. �he department is not considering stockpiling baloxavir at this time,�s. Clary, the spokeswoman, said. Jay Varma, a former C.D.C. epidemiologist who helped guide New York City� response to Covid-19 as a City Hall adviser, urged city and state health officials to conduct their own assessments. � do think it� important for New York State and New York City to be carefully assessing the potential needs for antivirals in the event that H5N1 evolves into sustained human-to-human transmission,�e said. The city� stockpile is smaller, with 427,000 courses of Tamiflu, and no baloxavir. Regardless of how bird flu develops, New York State may soon be forced to replenish its stockpile.

"Flu vaccine will curb bird flu risk for US farm workers, CDC deputy director says",1722556800000,"US launches major vaccination campaign in a bid to prevent healthcare strain and potential mutations of H5N1 virus

In the face of serious concerns over the spreading bird flu virus in US agriculture, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is pushing a major flu vaccination campaign among farm workers in a bid to prevent healthcare strain and combat potential mutations from the highly pathogenic bird virus.

Part of the campaign will seek to combat disinformation about vaccines, which has hampered previous efforts.

There are approximately 200,000 livestock workers in the United States, although the tally likely leaves out unofficial workers. It� not clear what vaccination rates look like in the livestock industry. On average, only 47% of Americans get the flu shot each year.

Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said he was optimistic the vaccine campaign will be successful.

�any agricultural and livestock workers come from countries where vaccination is very commonplace, well-accepted and rates are very high,�e said. If farm workers do have low rates of vaccination, �he reason is access, not reticence� he added.

The new $5m campaign will bring seasonal flu shots to farm workers and another $5m will go toward strengthening healthcare for them, including improved access to testing, treatment and personal protective equipment.

The campaign will distribute the seasonal flu shot, but not an H5N1-specific vaccine for bird flu, among communities that may have limited access to health care.

The US ordered 4.8m doses of an H5N1 vaccine in May, and vials are now coming off the production line. The US has also entered into an agreement with Moderna to produce an mRNA vaccine for bird flu, expected to begin trials in 2025.

The new vaccines have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), though there are options to use medications before clinical trials are complete through the FDA� expanded access program for people at high risk of severe illness or death.

Officials maintain the bird flu vaccines are not recommended for anyone at this time, while acknowledging the higher risk for farm workers compared to the general public.

For farm workers and close contacts of people who test positive, the CDC is instead recommending flu antivirals: preapproved drugs that may work better to block transmission than flu vaccines typically do. Antivirals may be used before or after a person is exposed to a virus.

The seasonal flu vaccine is being offered to protect the health of farm workers as well as the functionality of health systems, said Shah.

�ealthcare systems in rural areas can easily be overwhelmed �hat� true even in regular flu season,�e said. �accination against seasonal flu helps reduce the strain on hospitals.�

In the 2022, the flu shot prevented 6m illnesses, 65,000 hospitalizations and 3,700 deaths, according to the CDC.

Officials also hope the seasonal flu vaccine will reduce the chance of co-infection �hen someone gets sick with multiple strains of the flu at the same time. While the flu shot doesn� prevent all infections, it can lower the risks.

The seasonal flu shot could thus help prevent reassortment, where a worker might get bird flu and human flu at the same time and mix them to make an even worse variant.

�n theory, reassortment could lead to a new influenza virus that could pose a significant public health concern: a virus that has the transmissibility of seasonal influenza and the severity of H5N1,�hah said.

The new campaign will focus on increasing access, but strategies will likely differ depending on the state, Shah said. States may work with local health care providers and county health departments, they could go directly to farms and they could set up clinics and vaccination tents at social gatherings, churches, fairs and community centers.

There are a few reasons US officials don� recommend the bird flu vaccine for people yet, Shah said. So far, no one in the US has been hospitalized or died from H5N1, despite a global 50% mortality rate from this strain. The main symptom has been conjunctivitis, or pink eye, though some patients have developed more typical flu symptoms like coughing and sore throat.

The virus also isn� showing mutations to become more transmissible among people, and there isn� evidence that the virus is spreading from person to person, though testing remains very limited.

Health officials seem to see the US outbreak as a series of anomalies: no one has gotten very sick yet; they believe they can arrest the spread in livestock. A recent spate of cases among poultry workers in Colorado, where nine people tested positive, may be attributed to unusually high heat, making personal protective gear less effective, they say.

They weigh these concerns, which they see as relatively unusual, against longer-term issues like the spread of misinformation that may result in vaccine hesitancy.

�nything that happens following vaccination, whether caused by the vaccine or not, would and could be attributed to the vaccine, at least in the minds of the public,�hah said. �nd that could destroy confidence in that vaccine. It could destroy confidence in all vaccines for a number of years.�

In 1976, for example, an outbreak of a pandemic-potential swine flu led to a widespread vaccination campaign that was soon engulfed in misinformation. An extremely rare side effect known as Guillain-Barr�yndrome emerged �ut that� not what engendered skepticism, Shah says.

Several people had heart attacks after getting their vaccines in the same location. An investigation later ruled out a connection to the vaccine ��eople have heart attacks,�hah said �ut the association was already set among the public.

Similar anti-vaccine sentiment exploded from the fringes into the mainstream during the Covid pandemic. Some misinformation campaigns falsely attributed illness and death to vaccines.

�hat� different here is that this would be a new vaccine, and with anything new �ovid vaccines, a new drug, a new surgical procedure �ll eyes are on that,�hah said. �o the benefits outweigh the risks?�

It� a question health officials will weigh as the bird flu outbreak continues.

In the meantime, farm workers and others in close contact with animals continue to face elevated risks of bird flu.

The CDC recently changed its procedures to make flu antivirals like Tamiflu easier to access.

�amiflu is a very viable option before we get to this point of vaccination, and we are embracing it,�hah said. �n any kind of farm setting where any worker has been exposed, we have recommended it.�

Antivirals help reduce severity of illness, and they can also keep viruses from being transmitted by suppressing the amount of virus a person has in their body.

Workers could also take the medicine before they�e exposed, in order to prevent infection entirely.

�e�e discussing that, too,�hah said. �t raises some tough questions, though. How long should they be taking it? What about the side effects?�

But short-term use of the medication could be especially helpful for workers who are culling infected poultry and milking infected cows, particularly since the high-heat conditions implicated in the Colorado outbreak are expected to continue in many places.",Guardian,yes,yes,"The article mentions a global 50% mortality rate for the H5N1 strain, indicating a high human mortality rate.

Tens of thousands of seabirds swoop and squawk around us but just two come crashing through the canopy.

They are providence petrels, summoned by the quavering, high-pitched call of Jack Shick, a birdwatcher and tour guide on Lord Howe Island. Now he� cradling one in his hands.

�hey�e just got a terrific character,�hick says. �he island is their home. If anything happens they are gone.�

News from overseas has Shick worried. A bird flu strain, H5N1, is causing havoc in wild bird populations across the globe and experts have said there� a chance it could arrive in Australia this spring. The island� risk is low but its ecological value is high.

Australia remains the only continent in the world free from the deadly bird flu variant that, since a new variant emerged sometime in 2020, has caused havoc in poultry populations, wild birds and mammals worldwide. The virus has been linked to more than 900 cases in humans since 2003 and more than 400 deaths, and, since reaching the US in 2021, has spread to dairy cattle. A small number of human cases have also been confirmed in people working in the US dairy industry.

Nicholas Carlile, a seabird specialist who has worked on Lord Howe Island for more than 30 years, says there� a �ery remote�ossibility of a H5N1 outbreak because there� no �redible pathway�or it to reach the island via an infected sea or migratory bird.

And if the virus were to arrive, he says, few bird species live in dense enough colonies to transmit it. The colonies of burrowing species like the petrel have not been shown to have been affected overseas.

�here is still a risk, and we need to be ready for it �nd there� still a lot we don� know,�arlile says. ��e always said people should be informed, not alarmed.�

Australia-wide, there is a �oderate�isk the virus will reach the country this spring, as returning migratory birds have the potential to carry it, according to Dr Michelle Wille, a senior research fellow at the Centre for Pathogen Genomics at the University of Melbourne.

�e need to remain vigilant throughout �ost likely the first stop [of H5N1] would be in the northern parts of Australia, but we can� �ay that for sure,�he says.

Last year research led by Wille found no evidence of the virus in remote bird populations across the country, including samples taken on Lord Howe Island, but she says the prospect of the strain reaching Australia in the future is a matter of �hen, not if�

Lord Howe Island� head of biosecurity, Darryl Birch, says members of the island� citizen science network, many of whom own chickens, have bolstered its defences. The risk of the virus arriving is �ow�

The virus reached Antarctica in February and has killed thousands of Adelie penguins. It has killed an estimated 650,000 native birds since arriving in South America in late 2022, as well as 30,000 sea lions and 17,000 southern elephant seal pups.

A senior scientist at the CSIRO� Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness, Dr Frank Wong, says Australia is not in the flyways of migratory ducks and geese, the main hosts of bird flu viruses over long distances, so the chance of H5N1 reaching Australia is �elatively low�

But he says the H5N1 strain has shown the ability to infect a wide range of wild birds, increasing the chance of introduction via a �ridging�pecies.

The advocacy director of the Invasive Species Council, Jack Gough, says an outbreak in Australia could result in a �ildlife massacre�f similar scale to the black summer bushfires that ripped through the country in 2019-20.

�e were lucky last year, let� hope we�e lucky again this year,�ough says. �t could be catastrophic.�

A study released last year found an outbreak of the H5N1 variant would put the Australian black swan in �ignificant peril�

Gough says Australia� geographic isolation has so far kept the country virus-free, but could also mean native bird populations are more vulnerable.

A lack of funding for research to determine the effect on other endemic bird species has left the country even more ill-protected, Gough argues. �his has been a bottom-order priority for the government.�

In July the then federal agricultural minister, Murray Watt, allocated $7m to bolster Australia� defences against the H5N1 variant. �he arrival of migratory birds �eans we face a constant risk that is outside of our control,�e said.

The H5N1 strain is a particularly virulent type of high-pathogenicity avian influenza. State and federal governments are still monitoring outbreaks of several HPAI strains in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria.

The chief operating officer of Wildlife Health Australia, Dr Tiggy Grillo, says educating communities who live near migratory bird nesting sites about the signs of avian influenza, as well as surveillance and early reporting, would be critical to stomping out an outbreak.

Bird Flu Shows That the U.S. Learned All the Wrong Lessons From Covid,1723334400000,"Almost two years after the current outbreak of bird flu began in the United States, we are still flying blind.

Indications that H5N1 may have jumped to mammals first appeared the same year, when the virus killed hundreds of seals in New England and Quebec that summer, and then that fall there was a mass infection event at a Spanish mink farm. Epidemiologists have been warning about the risks of an overdue bird flu pandemic for decades, and so each new development arrived like the next beat in an already familiar story, almost too perfectly plotted to alarm. The outbreaks on American dairy farms began this March and the first human case in the United States since then was identified in April, which means that it has now been more than three full months since a pathogen long identified as among the most worrisome potential sources of a new pandemic infected an American this year. There is still nothing like a serious plan to even properly monitor the spread.

In Britain, the Health Security Agency recently raised its threat level to 4 out of 6, the stage immediately before large-scale human outbreaks. In Europe, countries are proactively vaccinating dairy and poultry workers against infection, with 15 nations already securing a total of 40 million doses through the European Commission. In the United States, despite having a stockpile of those vaccines, we are not distributing them, instead focusing on standing up voluntary supplies of seasonal flu vaccines to frontline workers. (The hope is that this will prevent animal infections of human flu that might aid in the further mutation of H5N1.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has cited the low number of cases to justify its inaction, but it has also moved remarkably slowly to promote the kind of widespread surveillance testing that could actually identify cases. Only recently has the agency begun to mobilize real funding for a testing push, after a period of months in which various federal groups batted around responsibility and ultimate authority like a hot potato. And as was the case early in the Covid-19 pandemic, the C.D.C.'s preferred test for bird flu ''has issues.'' Three months into the outbreak, only 45 people had even been tested; six weeks later, the total number of people tested had grown only to ''230+.''

Globally, H5N1 has infected more than 500 bird and mammal species, as Sharon Guynup has documented for Mongabay -- a global ''panzootic'' which some conservationists believe ''now presents an existential threat to the world's biodiversity.'' In the U.S., the bird flu has been identified in more than 100 million chickens in 48 states and 178 cattle herds spread across more than a dozen states, each a new cluster shedding virus out into a separate community. But delays in reporting details of even those dairy cases mean that the information is not especially helpful to any effort to control spread, and U.S. officials do not even appear to be sharing all the information they do have. Most American dairy farms are not regularly testing for H5N1, partly because the decision to do so has been left up to them, and in fact have ''refused to cooperate with efforts to chart how deeply the virus has infiltrated U.S. herds,'' as Helen Branswell of STAT has reported, ''seeing the possible stigma of admitting they have H5N1-infected cows as a greater risk than the virus itself.''

Most farms aren't supplying N95 masks, goggles or aprons to protect workers, either, and when Amy Maxmen of KFF News surveyed farm workers to ask why they weren't getting tested, ''no one had heard of bird flu, never mind gotten P.P.E. or offers of tests,'' she reported. ''One said they don't get much from their employers, not even water. If they call in sick, they worry about getting fired.'' Last month, a crew was deployed to slow the spread of the disease by killing every last chicken of 1.78 million on a large Colorado farm where H5N1 had broken out and six of the workers contracted the virus, partly because the gear they'd been provided was hard to use in the punishing 104-degree heat.

In June, Robert Redfield, former director of the C.D.C., echoed many epidemiologists in predicting that ''it's not a question of if, it's more of a question of when we will have a bird flu pandemic.'' In July, Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, warned that the steady beat of new cases ''screams at us that this virus is not going away.'' Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatician who studies global disease surveillance, marveled that the American effort to track the spread of the disease was absolutely amateurish and the country's apparent indifference ''unbelievable.''

In this cloud of ignorance, there is an encouraging silver lining: that the human cases we have identified suggest that in its current form, the bird flu does not appear to be as virulent as long feared or casually assumed.

According to the World Health Organization, the human fatality rate among previously recorded cases of H5N1 is 52 percent; Redfield estimated it was between 25 percent and 50 percent. These are terrifyingly high fatality rates, comparable to the deadliest viruses the modern world has ever seen. Experts had long believed those estimates were inflated by what is called ascertainment bias -- without widespread testing, officials only register the most serious cases, making every disease look more dangerous at first. But nevertheless, the eye-popping figures seemed to confirm those warnings, made over decades, that the world was overdue for a devastating bird flu outbreak.

And so it is at least something of a comfort, given how little understanding we have of the scope and scale of current spread, that what we do know suggests a much lower risk profile: Among 13 confirmed cases, none have been fatal or even especially serious, with the most significant symptom so far a form of pink eye. And because none of these cases appear to have come from other humans, it does not appear that H5N1 has yet acquired the sorts of mutations capable of enabling easy transmission between people. Although, as any specialist will remind you, the wider the spread, the greater the risk of such mutations.

Because the virus has spread much more widely than has been captured by testing, it's also fair to assume that it may be even less dangerous at the moment than it first appears. One very small-scale study published last week found antibodies in two of 14 farm workers who hadn't previously been tested for the virus, suggesting an ''invisible'' infection rate as high as 15 percent. But it's not clear what national picture might be responsibly extrapolated from such a small study, especially considering some possibly confounding cross-reactive immunity from exposure to other influenza. And another recent study found no such antibodies in farm workers. In the United States overall, more than 100 million birds have already been culled, but the true scale of the outbreak -- in animals and in humans -- remains a maddening matter of speculation.

As Covid-19 showed, diseases don't have to be especially lethal on a per case basis to brutalize populations and wreak havoc globally, particularly if they spread fast enough. And although this strain of H5N1 appears less virulent than once feared, the epidemiologist Michael Mina told me that in the event of large-scale human transmission we should probably brace for a true infection fatality rate in the low single digits -- a fraction of what was feared but still several multiples, at least, of Covid.

It's not clear when such a mutation might pop up, if ever. But one might've hoped that in enduring that punishing pandemic, we might have grown surer than ever that we would want to avoid repeating the experience. And yet, even before the real emergency had begun to recede, what Artie Vierkant and Beatrice Adler-Bolton have called ''the sociological production of the end of the pandemic'' helped usher in something like the opposite phase shift: an increasingly see-no-evil, hear-no-evil approach to public health.

As I wrote last year, America decided it went overboard on Covid, even though a major report in JAMA Health Forum last month suggested that nearly 250,000 lives might've been saved if the least restrictive states had followed the policy path of the most restrictive ones -- and that up to 200,000 additional lives might've been lost if the most restrictive states had instead followed the policy paths of the least restrictive. (And remember: These two poles are not ''do nothing'' and ''lock down like China in 2020 forever''; they represent merely the gap between American states that intervened more and those that intervened less.)

This growing indifference has affected those still worrying about Covid -- last year the C.D.C. stopped a lot of its pandemic data collection, making some basic facts like total deaths from Covid-19 much harder to track down than they once were, and over time, campaigns for paid sick leave and OSHA reforms to workplace safety standards have somewhat floundered, as well.

It has also helped bring about a more retributive phase of Covid retrospectives, in which mayors and governors, columnists and television commentators routinely and casually describe efforts at mitigation as excessive. More than half of states have passed laws tying the hands of public health officials in the case of a future pandemic. A much celebrated project testing wastewater for circulating pathogens in 41 states was abruptly shut down last month. And there is increasing enthusiasm among elected officials from New York to North Carolina for outright bans on mask wearing. Not mask mandates, which might require masking under certain worrying circumstances, but mask wearing at all. Some proposals have included vague mentions of medical and religious exemptions, but if they proceed it's not hard to imagine that an immunocompromised octogenarian boarding a city bus during the height of flu season would feel discouraged from wearing a mask for protection, then forced to justify it by disclosing his health condition. One such bill passed this week in Nassau County, New York. Undeniably, the country is in a different place regarding the risks from Covid than it was two or three or four years ago, and it is perfectly justifiable that many Americans are less interested in hearing about Covid than they were then. Perhaps it is also natural to not want to hear about public health matters at all -- the previous years were difficult and painful, after all. But to believe that means we should pass laws discouraging individuals from taking precautions, or to choose not to pursue surveillance measures to actually track the progress of a new disease threat, is a deeply pathological response to an experience of pandemic trauma, and one that implies it is more problematic to remind those around us of ongoing health risks than to take action to limit them. We seem to have memory-holed not just the suffering of Covid-19 but also the initial burst of inspiring if imperfect solidarity it produced, preferring instead to embrace the ''bipartisan'' indifference our pandemic tribalism ultimately yielded to.

"Will bird flu be the next pandemic? Vaccines are prepped, just in case.",1723420800000,"HOLLY SPRINGS, N.C. - quiet effort to prevent the next global pandemic began rolling off an assembly line this summer behind the gates of an office complex in suburban Raleigh.

In this sprawling factory, sheltered by thick pine groves, workers at CSL Seqirus are bottling millions of doses of a new vaccine targeting the H5N1 bird flu virus.

The virus, which first emerged in wild birds around 1997, has been spreading this year among dairy and poultry farms across the United States.

CSL Seqirus, in Holly Springs, N.C., where emergency bird flu pandemic vaccines are being readied by federal officials.

Thirteen farmworkers have been infected with the virus this year, some suffering eye redness, others a cough. No one became sick enough to require hospitalization, although, in other countries, about half of the people diagnosed with H5N1 over the years have died.

The virus is not being passed from person to person �nd that is key to why public health officials aren't hitting the panic button. Because the risk to the general public remains low, the federal government doesn� think it� worth vaccinating anyone against H5N1 yet �ven the farmworkers most at risk for getting sick from infected chickens or cows.

But behind the scenes, officials are getting ready at Seqirus' advanced facility in the biomanufacturing hub of Holly Springs.

Already, 4.8 million doses of a potential vaccine are sitting in an undisclosed Seqirus distribution center, ready for delivery if needed.

�n exercise like this gives our partners a chance to exercise that muscle, to make sure that the manufacturing� there,�awn O�onnell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told USA TODAY during an exclusive tour of the vaccine factory in late July.

In past disease outbreaks, she said, getting enough vaccine made in time to stop individual infections and slow the spread of disease has been the government's ""Achilles' heel.""

The syringe filler in the vaccine manufacturing facility at CSL Seqirus in Holly Springs, N.C. Federal officials are preparing emergency bird flu vaccine to avoid the next pandemic.

So here, in the heart of North Carolina� coveted Research Triangle, winding conveyor belts and hanging robotic arms are filling one thumb-sized glass vial at a time to avoid the next global pandemic.

True success would mean at some point the contents of those vials could essentially be flushed down the toilet �ecause bird flu no longer poses a theoretical threat to human health.

But at a time when the virus seems to be spreading to new farms every week, when America� healthcare system and treatment of farmworkers means infections are likely going undetected and fall flu season is rapidly approaching, public health officials say there� no such thing as being too careful.

�ou want to prepare for the worst case,�aid Dr. Raj Panjabi, who oversaw pandemic preparedness at the White House from 2021 to 2023 as a special assistant to President Joe Biden. �his gets the engine moving.�

On the production line

Through several security doors at the Seqirus facility, scores of workers in white zip-up plastic suits, hairnets and goggles worked along conveyor belts carrying small tubes along a packaging line.

Seqirus�ackaging lines are capable of producing 2 million flu vaccine doses every two weeks, said Jonathan Kegerise, vice president of manufacturing and the site head for the facility in Holly Springs. The 4.8 million doses of H5N1 were slotted in between batches of seasonal flu and didn� affect the production of those shots.

Robotic arms filled and capped vials as workers stood watch and prepared machines for the next batch. Along the way, lights flashed as cameras captured images of the vials for quality control. They would undergo additional inspections before they were packed away, ready for shipping if the federal government decided the H5N1 vaccines were needed.

The liquid was mainly divided into 10-dose vials. Seqirus produced an additional 250,000 pre-filled, single-dose syringes for times when opening a 10-dose vial would be wasteful.

Filled vials of commercial flu vaccines are inspected using a Brevetti inspection system at the CSL Seqirus vaccine manufacturing facility in Holly Springs, N.C. Seqirus recently produced millions of emergency bird flu vaccines as part of a federal response to avoid out the next pandemic.

The H5N1 vaccine had already been manufactured at the same Seqirus facility and stored at temperatures between 35.6 and 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Concentrated doses are made ahead of time as part of the national stockpile.

The vaccine has now been poured into vials allowing public health officials to more easily distribute doses if they are needed.

Making the substance for the doses takes about a month, followed by a day to formulate a batch, another day to fill the vials, and one last day to inspect and package them.

Seqirus is producing all 4.8 million doses under a $22 million agreement with the federal government, the company said.

Two types of vaccines are being prepared as defenses against the H5N1 virus. In addition to the vaccine being readied at Holly Springs, in July, the government also directed $176 million to Moderna to develop mRNA influenza vaccines, including for H5N1.

The two vaccines use different technologies �RNA can be made faster, in case a pandemic is spreading quickly; the more traditional, cell-based vaccine rolling off these assembly lines takes longer to produce.

It makes sense to now complete the cell-based vaccines that are already in the national stockpile, said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, the founding director of Boston University� Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases. She told USA TODAY an mRNA vaccine could help if the virus changes enough that a new vaccine has to be developed.

Still, Bhadelia, who worked in the Biden administration during COVID-19, worries that Congress hasn� allocated enough money to get ahead of the bird flu virus.

�othing can happen without money,�he said.

The vaccine we have now

Scientists hope the vaccine being poured into vials here would protect someone against a severe H5N1 infection, but they aren� sure.

So far it has been tested only in ferrets, the animal typically used by labs to test flu vaccines. Seqirus already manufactures an H5N1 vaccine that FDA has determined is safe and effective. This new bird flu vaccine replaces the H5N1 strain with the circulating virus.

The first human trials for the new vaccine have begun, starting with healthy people to ensure the vaccine triggers the desired effect on the immune system. Those results are expected later this year.

At this point, researchers believe the vaccine coming off this assembly line will be effective, but it's not guaranteed, Bhadelia said.

It� also possible that by the time the virus transforms enough to become truly dangerous to large numbers of people, it will have changed so much that the vaccine that has been prepared here will no longer work, said Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease and vaccine expert who directs the Vaccine Education Center at Children� Hospital of Philadelphia.

Even if the vaccine works well, there� the problem of scaling up production and getting it to enough people fast enough.

To work effectively, the vaccine requires two doses to be delivered at least three weeks apart. It� unclear how much protection someone gets after the first dose. In emailed responses, Seqirus wouldn� say when the vaccine doses expire and when they'd have to be replaced.

Delivering them to people will be challenging, too.

With the COVID-19 vaccine, it was more difficult than expected to get the doses from the warehouses to vaccine clinics and into arms. Cold storage, bottle size and other factors posed problems that had to be resolved on the fly.

The National Biodefense Plan, which Panjabi oversaw, was launched in 2022 with the goal of providing enough vaccines for all at-risk populations within four months of a pandemic� start.

If bird flu could be addressed early enough �ontained before it spreads beyond farmworkers and their families and not spread among the general public �t would be much easier to make enough vaccine and deliver it to the right people in four months' time.

Filled vaccines are inspected using a Seidenader visual inspection machine at the CSL Seqirus vaccine manufacturing facility in Holly Springs, N.C.

That� why some public health experts believe farmworkers should be offered vaccines before the virus has a chance to become more dangerous.

Vaccinating farmworkers would not reduce the number of people who become severely infected with bird flu, Bhadelia said, but she thinks they should be offered it as part of a research trial. ""It will just potentially help with severe disease and to further our scientific understanding,"" she said.

Still, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, doesn� think the time is right to start vaccinating anyone.

H5N1 has not caused serious cases of disease, it is not spreading person-to-person, and its genetics haven� changed substantially since the vaccine was developed against it. Right now, he told reporters in late July, a readily available antiviral is a better tool for anyone infected or exposed than the vaccine would be. , at this moment in time, is not performing the job that we really need,�hah said. A different vaccination Finland made a different decision. In June, Finnish officials began distributing 20,000 doses of a different Seqirus vaccine to people ages 18 and older exposed to animals they believed were susceptible to bird flu, including workers in the country� mink industry. In late July, fewer than 200 people in Finland had received shots, and the vaccines must be used by mid-September before they expire, said Mia Kontio, chief specialist for the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare's infectious disease control and vaccinations. Many Finns are on vacation in the summer, she added, so August is going to be �ery hectic�o quickly immunize people with the two-dose regimen. The return of wild migratory birds in the fall, potentially carrying the virus, add to the urgency, she said. �e felt that it's our responsibility to actually do something if we can,�ontio told USA TODAY. �ecause the situation might change very quickly.� Where are we now? In the U.S., federal officials expanded regulations on interstate transportation of livestock in recent months. They've added alerts on products such as unpasteurized milk, and warned that shared equipment can spread the virus among animals. They have also provided personal protective equipment, such as N95 respirators, goggles and gloves, in states affected by bird flu. Vials of un-inspected commercial flu vaccines are readied for inspection as they move through the CSL Seqirus vaccine manufacturing facility in Holly Springs, N.C. Recently, federal officials launched an effort to vaccinate livestock workers against the seasonal flu. That vaccine doesn� offer any protection against H5N1, which is a different strain of influenza, said Shah, from the CDC. Getting the seasonal vaccine, however, could prevent someone from simultaneously having both the seasonal flu, which is highly contagious, and H5N1, which can be extremely dangerous. A worst-case scenario would be a virus that combines the two, Shah said. Flu viruses are known to exchange genes with one another, so such a combination is always possible. �iruses are sort of smart,�ay Chu, a clinical professor of epidemiology at Colorado School of Public Health, told USA TODAY. �ur bodies offer the place where they replicate. And so if you don't let the virus into you, you aren't going to be contributing to the genetic growth of this virus. This is what you want to stop. Because the more people get infected, the more viruses grow, and the more chances of the genetic variant arising of deleterious effect.� Such a combination, she emphasized, would be �ad for us.�",USA Today,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that about half of the people diagnosed with H5N1 over the years have died.

Ecologists warn deadly H5N1 bird flu could arrive in Australia via Antarctica as preparations ramp up,1723593600000,"Influx of highly pathogenic strain a case of �ot if, but when�nd could devastate native wildlife, experts sayGet our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast

The Australian government is ramping up preparations for a highly pathogenic and contagious strain of bird flu potentially reaching Australia via its Antarctic territory and Macquarie Island, warning it could devastate wildlife and be passed to people.

Government agencies led by the Australian Antarctic Division at a planning exercise in Hobart on Wednesday were told an influx of the virulent H5N1 Avian flu strain that has killed millions of seabirds, wild birds and poultry overseas was a case of �ot if, but when�

Dr Louise Emmerson, a seabird ecologist with the Antarctic division, said there was a chance the strain could arrive in Australia� Antarctic territory or on Macquarie Island in the Southern Ocean when migratory species return in spring. H5N1 was confirmed in western Antarctica in February. It has also killed an estimated 30,000 sea lions and 17,000 southern elephant seal pups in the Antarctic region.

Emmerson said the strain had been spreading rapidly, including moving to other unexpected animals such as cats, raccoons and cows.

�t� had a very big impact on many different species �ome populations have been really badly impacted with in excess of 90% mortality,�he said.

The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, last week warned the highly infectious strain was �oming for us� and said it could push some bird species towards extinction if it arrived in Australia.

Plibersek said the risk applied to both birds in captive breeding programs and species that were currently doing well in the wild, and that the coming months would be a �articularly dangerous time�s birds migrated from the northern hemisphere. There needed to be an �ll-in�pproach across government and private organisations to minimise the threat, she said.

The planning exercise on Wednesday was testing emergency response and coordination in the event of an outbreak, preparations for seabird mass mortality and potential wildlife to human transmission.

Robb Clifton, the division� acting branch head of operations and logistics, said about 80 people were involved. He said scientists would be sent to Australia� Antarctica territory in spring to check for signs of the strain during summer breeding. Monitoring on Macquarie Island, a world heritage outpost about halfway between Tasmania and Antarctica and a haven for penguins, seals and seabirds, occurs year-round.

�hat we do know is spring and going into summer we get a lot more wildlife moving around the sub-Antarctic,�lifton said. �e know the risk of [transmission] is going up.�

Dr Brant Smith, from the federal agriculture department, said

early detection was key. He said anyone who saw sick, dying or diseased animals should contact authorities.

Forgotten epidemic: with over 280 million birds dead how is the avian flu outbreak evolving?,1725408000000,"New data reveals the virus has spread to endangered species in Antarctica �et the H5N1� risk to biodiversity, farming and human health is little explored

With at least 280 million birds dead since October 2021, the highly infectious H5N1 strain of avian flu has devastated poultry and caused the biggest sudden drop of the world� wild bird population in decades. The millions of wild birds killed includes tens of thousands of endangered and endemic species �nd tens of thousands of mammals have died too.

Today, new data, published in Nature Communications, documents the disease� spread to the southernmost tip of the planet �he Antarctic region �here it has inflicted significant die-offs in elephant seals and fur seals. This outbreak has affected every continent except Oceania, and yet there has been little coverage of the impact on global biodiversity and farming systems �r of potential risks to human health.

�� not sure the public is aware of the significance of the avian influenza,�aid lead author Prof Ashley Banyard, a virologist at the UK� Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) lab in Weybridge, Surrey. �t� not been front-page news.�

Experts are racing to find out more about the disease and understand where it might go next. �e can� rest on our laurels �e have to make sure we are continually monitoring and tracking the threat from avian influenza viruses,�aid Banyard. �t� almost impossible for me to predict what� going to flare up where.�

Dr Connor Bamford, an assistant professor in virology from Queen� University Belfast, said there could be further surprises. �ne major open space for the virus remains the human population.�

How did it start?

The bird flu variant that caused these deaths is more than a quarter of a century old. Highly pathogenic H5N1 was first reported in China in 1996, when it was found at a goose farm. The origins of all highly pathogenic avian influenzas �he ones that cause severe disease and death �ave been tracked back to poultry farms.

�he history of [bird flu strain] 2.3.4.4b goes back before we noticed these mass die-offs of wild birds,�aid Bamford. �ut something seemed to happen in 2021.�hat is when the strain became the dominant bird flu virus globally, and is now highly pathogenic and highly contagious.

What does an outbreak look like?

The ornithologist Peter Stronach was among the first people in the UK to witness the unfolding disaster in the breeding bird population. On 11 May 2022, he was walking along thebeach at Littleferry in Scotland, a walk he had done often, to watch birds flying overhead. But that day was different: �here were just corpses of birds scattered along the high tide line,�e said.

In total, Stronach counted 72 dead birds, including puffin, guillemot and great skua. The virus had killed birds from 17 different species, the first time several species had been killed in summertime (rather than overwintering species). �hat� really unusual. It signalled something was wrong,�e said.

As the season wore on �verything escalated� said Stronach. Fishers were reporting carcasses of birds far out at sea. �oing some primitive maths we were able to work out huge numbers were involved and no one was monitoring it.�

In the coming months, tens of thousands of seabirds would die. The virus survived the summer in Europe and quickly went global, spreading along bird migration routes.

What has the toll been?

Bird flu has caused the most significant and sudden loss of birds in decades, with some of the long-lived seabird species likely to take several years to recover. It has led to the death and mass slaughter of more than 280 million poultry birds since October 2021, based on data from the World Animal Health Information System. There is no total figure for wild bird deaths, though it is estimated to be in the millions.

It has been particularly destructive in species of birds with a small geographic spread. The first big outbreak in the winter of 2021 was among the Svalbard barnacle geese in the Solway Firth where at least 13,000 birds died : a third of the global population of that species. In March 2022, more than 2,200 dalmatian pelicans died in Greece, or 40% of the south-east European population. The UK, which is home to most nesting great skua pairs, has lost three-quarters of those on surveyed sites since bird flu struck, according to a study published in February. Across Europe, more than 20,000 sandwich terns died during the 2022 breeding season�r 17% of the population in north-west Europe �n an outbreak that killed almost all chicks within colonies. In total it has killed birds from 320 species, and mammals from dozens of species.

How does it spread?

One bird can infect as many as 100, with the virus present in faeces, mucus, blood and saliva. A teaspoon of faeces is enough to kill an entire house of chickens or turkeys, experts say, with mortality rates of up to 100%.

Where has it been detected?

Australia and New Zealand are the only places still free of outbreaks among wild birds. In November 2021, the first case in North America was recorded in Newfoundland, Canada, probably carried by a bird migrating from northwest Europe along the East Atlantic flyway. By mid-2022, more than 230 outbreaks had been recorded in wild animals, and it had spread throughout Canada and the US.

In October 2022 it arrived in South America. Data suggests there were three separate introductions. It spread the length of the continent (6,000km) in less than six months, arriving in Tierra del Fuego in April 2023. In total more than 500,000 wild birds have died in South America.

In October 2023, bird flu arrived on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. In total it has killed animals from about 10 species in the Antarctic region (most of them on South Georgia), including fur seals, elephant seals and gentoo penguins.

Researchers warned of large geographic �lack boxes�here it is not known whether there is bird flu in wild populations, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia.

�t� pretty unclear what� happened in Asia and Africa. If you do look, it is there, but it has not been well tracked,�aid Bamford.

There are endemic strains in Bangladesh and Cambodia. Japan has recorded recent cases in large-billed crows ; South Korea has reported it in whooper swans. Studies from west and south Africa confirm cases there : since January 2022, Burkina Faso has recorded 133 outbreaks, including three in wild birds. In early 2023, thousands of seabird deaths were recorded in Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau, including caspian terns, royal terns and grey-headed gulls.

What about other animals?

In South America, bird flu caused mass die-offs of mammals. More than 20,000 South American sea lions died in Chile and Peru, which is 9% of the regional population. An estimated 17,000 southern elephant seal pups died in Argentina �quivalent to 96% of all pups born in the country in 2023. This amounts to the loss of nearly an entire generation of seals, which take at least three years to reach maturity.

In March this year, bird flu started spreading among US cattle. It is the first time a bird flu virus has been found in cows, with more than 100 herds affected and probably more that have not yet been reported.

Poultry operations near farms have also reported cases, suggesting the virus may be spilling back into birds. Barn cats and mice have also tested positive for H5N1 so they could spread the virus out of farms into the wider environment.

What is the risk to humans?

As the virus evolves, it could become more of a threat to people, according to a recent report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There have been nine cases of H5N1 in humans in the US (although symptoms have been relatively mild) and officials said they expected to see more. �he more infections there are among cows, the more risk there is for infections to occur among humans,�aid Dr Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC.

The UN health agency� chief scientist has also said the risk of bird flu spreading to humans is an �normous concern� So far, there is no evidence that H5N1 is spreading between humans. But in the hundreds of cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals over the past 20 years the mortality rate is above 50%.

What� next?

In October 2023, bird flu arrived in the Antarctic region. Researchers on the ground have counted hundreds of carcasses of dead seals in South Georgia. But it is a big area with few eyes on the ground.

�t could be that the number we detect is only a fraction of the number that have actually died,�aid Norman Ratcliffe, a bird ecologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who has worked on penguins and seabirds on South Georgia. Although it has killed gentoo and king penguins, losses among penguins have been relatively small. �here is cause for optimism. It� not as bad as we thought it could be when we saw the first cases,�aid Ratcliffe. Generally, viruses evolve in a way that means they do not kill their hosts �hey tend to become less dangerous and more transmissible over time. The virus has also travelled around the whole world, so it has little new territory to cover �xcept for Oceania. �redicting the future of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is one of the biggest challenges facing the field,�ccording to Bamford. �t is possible this season could be less affected due to a build up of immunity in wild birds who were infected and survived in the preceding seasons. However, we continue to detect the virus in European birds sporadically so we should expect to see further outbreaks.�",Guardian,yes,yes,"The article mentions a human mortality rate above 50% for H5N1 in cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals over the past 20 years. It also provides nuance by discussing the potential for virus evolution to reduce lethality, as viruses tend to become less dangerous and more transmissible over time.","I'm not sure the public is aware of the significance of the avian influenza, it's not been front-page news.",Prof Ashley Banyard,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,8,3,7,5,4,2,6,8,2,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,7.9,9.62,0.0533913043,0.0971594203,0.0787463768,0.2204275362,0.0621521739,0.4905362319,0.3218913043,0.1379710145,0.0833913043,0.0791884058,0.1015,0.11125,0.1485,0.52225,0.0,1.07675,0.27325,0.3045,0.162,0.0,0.0,-0.375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.375,0.0,0.0,0.0,,We can't rest on our laurels – we have to make sure we are continually monitoring and tracking the threat from avian influenza viruses.

First person tests positive for bird flu without clear exposure to sick animals,1725580800000,"A Missouri resident has tested positive for bird flu even though there is no evidence the person came into contact with an animal infected with the virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a Friday evening news release.

Acquiring the virus without animal contact raises safety concerns because it may be an indication that the potentially quite deadly virus could develop the ability to transmit from human-to-human, although the CDC still considers such a risk ""low"" at the moment.

The person is the 14th infected with H5N1 in the U.S. this year and the first to be hospitalized and to test positive without coming into known contact with an infected animal. The others, who were all described as having ""mild"" symptoms, had worked on farms known to have H5N1-infected cattle or poultry.

It's unclear how the Missouri patient was infected or how sick the virus made them. The person, who has not been identified, was hospitalized Aug. 22 and treated with an anti-viral medication after a flu test turned positive. When that test didn't match the seasonal flu, it was sent for further testing and the H5N1 result was confirmed Thursday, the CDC said. The person has since been released from the hospital and recovered.

The ""biosecure"" sign is part of the farm's normal entry signage but federal officials were monitoring the farm on Tuesday, July 30, 2024.

Public health officials have been concerned about bird flu, because it has been lethal in about half of the people known to have contracted it worldwide. Other milder cases may have went undetected.

Tracing its path

The CDC will analyze the genetics of the latest patient's strain to understand if it is the same one that infected the other people and farm animals or a different one.

Understanding the origin is crucial for understanding the threat, if any, that the virus poses to the general public, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University and a former chief scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

If the person is infected with the same strain as the other people, there has to be a chain of transmission, either from the sick animals or from another infected person, Goodman said.

Lisa Cox, a spokesperson for the Missouri health department, said in an email that the Missouri patient's contacts remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period, so they did not pass the virus on to anyone else.

It's possible the person carries a new strain of the virus that has not been seen before. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he thinks the Missouri patient most likely caught a different strain of the virus after coming into close contact with an infected migratory bird.

Late summer is when many birds are migrating, he said, so ""this is the season we're going to see that virus moving."" A backyard bird feeder ""is the classic example,"" he said. Osterholm said he doesn't know if the patient has a feeder or was exposed to one, but ""that's the kind of exposure that would not be uncommon.""

Controlling the risk

The current U.S. outbreak was likely sparked by a wild bird that infected cattle on a dairy farm in Texas and then spread to farms in more than a dozen other states -ut has not been previously reported in Missouri cattle. Related strains of H5N1 have been circulating in wild birds since at least 1997.

So far, humans have not shown high susceptibility to the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious disease expert who directs the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The only people who've fallen ill so far were those on farms exposed to very high levels of virus, which penetrated deep into their lower respiratory tract. Perhaps the person in Missouri, whom state officials described as having an ""underlying medical condition,"" was particularly susceptible to such a lower respiratory tract infection, he said.

People, even those who have had the seasonal flu or who get annual vaccines, have no immunity to H5 flu viruses, and thus they could become quite ill if infected, Offit said.

CDC closely monitors data from influenza surveillance systems, particularly in states with known animal outbreaks. So far they've seen no sign of unusual flu activity in people, according to the release.

Dawn O'Connell, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services gets a look at the syringe filler during a tour of bird flu vaccine manufacturer CSL Seqirus in Holly Springs, NC.

Goodman praised the CDC monitoring, but thinks the agency and others need to be doing more to get ahead of any potential major outbreak. ""This was another warning shot,"" Goodman said. Just this week, Goodman, co-wrote an opinion piece in the Journal of the American Medical Association calling for more investment in public health, including in a vaccine strategy, to address H5N1 both in the U.S. and abroad.

""The time to prepare for a potential infectious outbreak is before it occurs, because when it occurs it's too late,"" he said. ""Hopefully, it doesn't turn into a public health threat and I think that's most likely, but we need to pay attention. We can't pretend that the world will never have another pandemic.""

The CDC said it continues to assess the risk to the general public from H5N1 as ""low"" and is not changing its recommendations related to the virus at this time.

Not enough information has been made public about the Missouri patient to understand how concerning the situation is, Offit said.

Missouri sees first positive bird flu case without known animal contact,1725667200000,"Also first time for someone with H5 virus to be hospitalized, and CDC says it is studying patient specimen more

A person in Missouri with no known animal contact has tested positive for H5 bird flu, the state� department of health and senior services said Friday.

It� the first time a patient in the US outbreak has had no known exposure to sick animals. And it is the first time someone has been hospitalized with bird flu �hough it� not clear yet whether influenza was the reason for hospitalization or it was incidental.

The patient, who has underlying health conditions, was hospitalized on 22 August and tested positive for flu A. Doctors sent a sample to the Missouri state public health laboratory, where it was found to be of the H5 subtype, which is also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza �r bird flu.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that it is H5 and said it is studying the specimen more.

In past cases, officials have sought to understand whether human cases are caused by the strain that has circulated in wild birds and mammals in the US since 2022 or whether it is more closely related to the variant specifically in dairy cows. They will also likely look to see whether it has picked up mutations to make it more transmissible or virulent among people.

In an exclusive interview with the Guardian in July, Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said there were several concerns officials were watching for in this outbreak.

�ne is increasing severity of disease,�uch as if a person were hospitalized or died from bird flu, he said.

The previous cases in the US have been mild, but they were among farmworkers, who tend to be healthy and strong. In the wider population, especially among those with other health conditions, bird flu could prove more dangerous. Globally, the mortality rate hovers at about 50% of confirmed cases �lthough there are likely less severe cases that go undetected.

�he second would be the nature of transmission,�hah said. �re we seeing person-to-person transmission?�

In the two decades since H5N1 was observed among people, onward transmission among people has been exceedingly rare, he said.

Another major cause for concern with transmission centers on who is getting sick.

�f we were to see individuals with no connection to a farm whatsoever, or chicken exposure, developing signs and symptoms �hat would be greatly concerning,�hah said. �ven if there was no other transmission route identified, that would be a sign that something else is happening.�

Officials will probably continue tracing the patient� potential exposures and contacts with other people to see how the virus spread.

Bird flu is usually found in domestic and wild birds, but in recent years it has significantly expanded its range to circulate widely in mammals, including dairy cows and other livestock.

Two indoor cats in Colorado recently tested positive for the virus. House mice have also tested positive.

No bird flu has been detected in cows in Missouri, but it has been found in poultry and wild birds.

It �an occasionally infect humans through close contact with infected animals or contaminated environments� according to the Missouri press release.

This is the 15th case of bird flu among people in the US since 2022 �nd the 14th this year. This is the first known human case of bird flu in Missouri.

The patient had recovered and was discharged from the hospital, the Missouri statement said.

Inquiry into unexplained bird flu case in Missouri broadens to a close contact,1726185600000,"A close contact of the person in Missouri who had an unexplained H5N1 bird flu infection last month was also sick around the same time, but was not tested for influenza, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday. The CDC revealed the previously undisclosed information in FluView, its weekly update on influenza activity. In an hour-long press briefing involving CDC officials on Thursday, no mention was made of this possible additional case. In a statement on Friday, the CDC reiterated that it does not believe there has been spread of H5N1 between the infected individual and any of his or her close contacts. “There is no epidemiological evidence at this time to support person-to-person transmission of H5N1, though, public health authorities continue to explore how the H5N1-positive individual in Missouri contracted the virus,�? the CDC said, adding it would support studies of contacts of the cases to try to determine if any of them also contracted the virus. A spokesperson for the agency told STAT that a health worker who had contact with the confirmed case in the hospital also developed mild flu-like symptoms, but tested negative for influenza. On Thursday, Nirav Shah, the CDC’s principal deputy director, suggested it was beginning to look like the Missouri case was a one-off — a case of unexplained disease caused by a non-human flu strain without ongoing transmission. Though rare and unsettling — any human infections with flu viruses that don’t circulate in people raise the specter of pandemic influenza — such events occasionally occur with swine influenza viruses. ADVERTISEMENT “Right now, evidence points to this being a one-off case,�? Shah said. When asked to explain that comment, he suggested there was no evidence of any onward spread from the infected individual. He did not mention the fact that a close contact may have been infected at the same time. “Thus far we have not seen any evidence of person-to-person transmission. None of this individual’s close contacts have any evidence of onward transmission. None of the individuals that this individual came into contact with have developed any signs and symptoms. So we haven’t seen any evidence of it at this time,�? he said. The FluView report gave no information about the timing of the second person’s illness, or whether an investigation into his or her movements might explain how the H5N1 virus made its way to at least one and possibly two people in a state that has not reported outbreaks in dairy cows. Lisa Cox, a spokesperson for the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services, said investigators learned that a second individual — a household contact of the confirmed case — had also experienced symptoms only after the individual had recovered. By then it was too late to be able to test by PCR. “The onset of symptoms for both the case and the case’s household contact occurred on the same day,�? Cox told STAT in an email. “The possible opportunities of exposures for this close contact were also evaluated as part of the investigation. Serological testing�? — in other words, testing of blood for antibodies to the virus — “is being considered.�? During the Thursday press briefing, Shah said that the agency hopes close contacts of the confirmed case will agree to give blood samples to see if there might have been undetected transmission from or around the individual. It is a bit too soon to conduct such tests, Shah said, because development of antibodies takes a little time after an infection. H5N1 viruses, which originate in wild birds, have long been high on the list of possible pandemic viruses. Humans do not have immunity to this family of flu viruses. The virus has circulated off and on since the late 1990s, triggering massive and deadly poultry outbreaks in many parts of the world, and infecting about 900 people. About half of the people known to have been infected with H5N1 have died. ADVERTISEMENT H5N1 bird flu has been spreading in dairy cows in parts of the United States since late last year or early this year. The unprecedented outbreak — the virus hadn’t been thought to be a risk to cows before — has spread to 203 herds in 14 states to date. And 14 people have been infected with the virus this year, including the case in Missouri. The U.S. cases prior to the Missouri case were all mild; none of the people needed to be hospitalized. That was not the case with the H5N1 case in Missouri, which was first reported last week. On Friday, the CDC revealed it had succeeded in subtyping the neuraminidase protein of the virus — the N of its name — and that it is indeed H5N1. The virus is genetically similar to those that have been circulating in dairy cattle. The Missouri individual, who had multiple health issues, was hospitalized on Aug. 22 for symptoms that did not immediately appear to be flu-related: chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness. While in the hospital the person was tested for flu and was given antiviral medication after testing positive. The person recovered and was discharged. To date public health investigators have been unable to explain how the infection occurred; the individual had no known exposures to animals or poultry, wild birds or wild animals, and did not consume raw milk products.

Possible Cluster of Human Bird-Flu Infections Expands in Missouri,1727395200000,"Seven people in contact with a patient hospitalized with bird flu also developed symptoms, the C.D.C. reported. Some are undergoing further tests.

A possible cluster of bird-flu infections in Missouri has grown to include eight people, in what may be the first examples of person-to-person transmission in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday.

If confirmed, the cases in Missouri could indicate that the virus may have acquired the ability to infect people more easily. Worldwide, clusters of bird flu among people are extremely rare. Most cases have resulted from close contact with infected birds.

Health officials in Missouri initially identified a patient with bird flu who was hospitalized last month with unusual symptoms. The patient may have infected one household member and six health care workers, all of whom developed symptoms, according to the C.D.C.

Investigators have not yet confirmed whether any of those seven individuals were infected with the virus, called H5N1, leaving open the possibility that they had Covid or some other illness with flulike symptoms.

Still, the news alarmed experts.

�e should be very concerned at this point,�aid Dr. James Lawler, co-director of the University of Nebraska� Global Center for Health Security.

�obody should be hitting the panic button yet, but we should really be devoting a lot of resources into figuring out what� going on.�

If officials confirm H5N1 infection in the household member or any of the health care workers, �t means the virus is inching closer and closer to what would be a real pandemic virus,�r. Lawler said. �hat is when Pandora� box is open.�

There have been 13 other confirmed cases of bird flu in people since the outbreak in dairy cattle was announced in March. Those cases were all acquired from interactions with infected dairy cattle or poultry.

Missouri has not reported any infected herds. The hospitalized patient was tested as part of routine flu surveillance. The infection worried experts, because the individual had no known contact with cattle or birds.

There have been no H5N1-related deaths reported so far in Americans, and most cases have been relatively mild, suggesting that the virus does not have the high mortality rate of up to 50 percent seen in Asia.

But the small number of confirmed cases so far makes it difficult to estimate its virulence, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

�f we�e thinking about pandemic influenza, even in a worst-case scenario only a tiny fraction of cases would be severe enough,�he said. �t the scale that we would expect pandemic influenza, you quickly get to numbers that overwhelm.�

In previous pandemics, health care workers have often been the sentinel cases, Dr. Rivers said: �cross outbreaks, health care workers are often an early sign that something has gone wrong.�

�f any of those six cases are confirmed, then that would definitely increase my level of alarm,�he added.

In a news briefing two weeks ago, federal officials referred to the hospitalized patient as a �ne-off�nd said no close contacts had become sick.

But the next day, the C.D.C. disclosed that someone who lived with the patient had developed gastrointestinal symptoms, which can sometimes accompany flu.

Two health care workers who had contact with the patient also developed symptoms, C.D.C. officials said at the time. One of those workers turned up negative for flu but may have been tested too late to pick up signs of infection.

On Friday, the C.D.C. added four more health care workers to the list of possible cases. Three of the workers developed symptoms after the hospital instituted precautions against respiratory infection, but they were not tested for active infection at the time.

Officials are now analyzing results of antibody tests that would reveal whether these individuals were exposed to the virus.

No one in the possible cluster has been identified, nor has the hospital at which the initial patient was treated. The investigation is led by Missouri health officials with remote assistance from the C.D.C.

Experts criticized this slow trickle of information and the lack of important epidemiological details, including the timing of symptoms in the initial patient and close contacts.

�pidemiologists can get a lot of information out of dates and timing and the nature of the contact,�r. Rivers said.

The tone of official communications has also been unduly optimistic, Dr. Lawler said.

�he messaging that has come out has been maybe a little more confident and a little more placating than it probably should be,�e said. �t does not help to build back the credibility of the public health sector.�

Ideally, the first case would have led to a full investigation, but Missouri health officials did not get confirmation of H5N1 until after the patient was discharged.

Even now, a thorough recounting of the investigation and timeline of infections would help clarify how the virus might have spread, experts said.

Because the initially identified patient had no known exposure to infected animals, he or she may have acquired the virus from another person who was infected.

H5N1 has infected a staggering array of birds and animals, including mammals, over the past few years, but it is has not proved capable of spreading easily among people.

C.D.C. officials were able to sequence only a portion of the virus isolated from the hospitalized patient. The analysis suggested that the virus had not diverged from the version circulating in dairy cattle, nor had it acquired mutations that would allow it to spread readily from person to person.

But every new infection gives the virus opportunities to acquire those mutations and evolve into a form that could set off the next pandemic.

With the advent of respiratory season, cases of seasonal flu, Covid and respiratory syncytial virus may muddy the picture further, making it difficult to identify H5N1 cases.

�t� not even a needle in a haystack, it� kind of like a needle in a stack of needles,�r. Lawler said.

In the wake of the backlash against public health measures during the coronavirus pandemic, officials have been reluctant to compel people to get tested. But there are other tools that help officials gauge the extent of the outbreak.

Wastewater analyses have shown H5N1 spikes in several states that are not linked to infected animals or birds, although the peaks are usually transient.

If there were large numbers of undetected infections, �e would see a really consistent wastewater signal,�aid Sam Scarpino, director of A.I. and life sciences at Northeastern University.

Still, health officials should test wastewater in areas where they suspect the virus might be circulating, and investigate the source of any signals.

�e need to get this thing out of the dairy cow populations, because if it continues to circulate in these populations, it� just a matter of time before we�e dealing with the big outbreak,�r. Scarpino said.

�e have more than enough evidence now to know that we really need to take decisive action.�",NYTimes,yes,yes,"The article mentions that there have been no H5N1-related deaths reported in Americans and most cases have been relatively mild, suggesting the virus does not have the high mortality rate seen in Asia.

Bird flu in humans flies under radar.,1721433600000,"Patchy testing makes it difficult to know how many people in the US are infected with H5N1 US HEALTH officials are struggling to monitor people who have been exposed to a bird flu virus circulating in dairy cows. The patchy surveillance means infections in people may go undetected, making it difficult to mitigate the virus’s spread and raising the risk of the pathogen developing mutations that could make it more dangerous to people. The virus, a strain of avian influenza known as H5N1, has killed millions of birds and thousands of mammals worldwide. It has been spreading in dairy cows across the US for almost five months, affecting more than 155 herds in 13 states. On 15 July, the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE) announced that five workers on a poultry farm in the state had tested positive for the virus. Earlier this year, four people who had close contact with sick cows tested positive for H5N1, and in 2022 a US poultry worker contracted the virus. Everyone infected has only experienced mild symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the CDPHE. However, H5N1 can cause severe illness in humans. Out of the almost 900 known cases in people worldwide, about half were fatal. Fortunately, the virus hasn’t been found to spread between people, though that could change if it develops mutations that increase its transmissibility in mammals. That is why it is crucial to monitor for signs of illness in people exposed to H5N1, says Meghan Davis at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. A spokesperson for the CDC says that as of 12 July, at least 1390 people have been monitored for the virus related to the cattle outbreak, and at least 61 of them have been tested for it. The organisation recommends that state and local health departments survey people who have close contact with sick cows for symptoms like eye redness, cough and fatigue until 10 days after their last exposure. But surveillance is a voluntary process and requires collaboration between the CDC, state and local health departments, farmers and workers. In some states, distrust of government has prevented officials from monitoring people on farms with sick cows, says Jamie Jonker at the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), a non-profit organisation in Virginia advocating for dairy farmers. Some farms may bar government agencies from checking on the health of their employees or fail to alert those agencies when a worker falls ill. This distrust may stem, in part, from the farms’ locations, he says. Most are in rural areas of the country, which have historically been underserved by government health agencies. The NMPF, which has relationships with both the CDC and dairy farmers, is trying to bridge some of these issues, says Jonker. In the meantime, H5N1 surveillance continues to vary across states, with some workers on affected farms not being monitored at all, says Davis.

Is another pandemic on the way?,1712966400000,"The first case of H5N1 bird flu passing from cows to humans should spark expert investigation, but not general panic, says Grace Wade NEWS of a bird flu virus infecting dairy cows across the US and a person exposed to the animals may raise concerns, but experts say we shouldn’t worry about another pandemic yet. “At this point in time, I would not think a pandemic is likely,” says Jodie Guest at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. “The risk to humans is quite low. It’s not nothing, but it is very, very low.” Since 2021, a subtype of the bird flu virus, H5N1, has devastated global bird populations. It has also infected an increasing number of mammals, including foxes, seals, mink and, most recently, cows. In late March, dairy cows across Texas, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Idaho tested positive for the virus. A person also contracted it after interacting with the cows – the first known case of H5N1 jumping to humans from another mammal. The individual’s only symptom is eye redness, and they are recovering, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But bird flu can be deadly. Around half of the 887 people confirmed to have been infected with H5N1 since 2003 have died from the virus. “Any case of H5N1 is concerning because it is highly dangerous to humans,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) on 3 April. The good news is the virus hasn’t been transmitted between people. Plus, initial testing of samples from the infected person and cows don’t show mutations that would significantly increase that risk, according to the CDC. “This particular virus is still very much a bird virus,” says Richard Webby at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Tennessee. Yet he says each time the virus infects or transmits between mammals, it could acquire mutations that may make it more dangerous to humans. That is why the WHO says it is working closely with the CDC to track the virus. The US Department of Agriculture has also stepped up surveillance efforts. One unknown is whether the virus is spreading between cows. Evidence suggests that is the case, says Fred Gingrich at the American Association of Bovine Practitioners (AABP) in Ohio. For instance, cows in Michigan became ill after those from a herd in Texas were introduced to the farm. “Probably our biggest question is how it is transmitted between cows,” says Gingrich. Genetic sequencing will help trace the virus’s spread, says Meghan Davis at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, but this will take time. In the interim, the AABP is advising dairy farmers to provide workers with masks, gloves and other protective equipment to prevent the virus’s spread. People should also avoid raw milk and raw milk products, which can transmit the virus. Otherwise, the general public’s risk is low. “If you’re an average consumer and you’re drinking pasteurised milk, don’t panic. Be aware, but don’t panic,” says Davis.

A 'highly pathogenic strain' of H5N1 bird flu has been reported in China's Hunan province,1580515200000,"* A ""highly pathogenic"" strain of the H5N1 avian flu has been reported in China's Hunan province, China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said.

* According to a report from Reuters 4,500 chickens died on the farm where the outbreak occurred.

* The government culled nearly 18,000 chickens as a result of the outbreak.

* Whether a strain of avian flu is deemed ""highly pathogenic"" relates to its ability to kill chickens, according to USGS.

* The World Health Organization says that while human cases of H5N1 can occur, it ""does not infect humans easily.""

* Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

A ""highly pathogenic"" strain of the H5N1 bird flu has been reported in China's Hunan province, Chinese officials said, according to a Saturday report from Reuters.

The outbreak was reported on a farm in the city of Shaoyang in the Hunan province, according to China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Of the 7,850 chickens on the farm where the outbreak occurred, 4,500 died of the H5N1 avian flu, Reuters reported.

The Chinese government said it culled 17,828 chickens as a result of the H5N1 outbreak, per Reuters.

Per the United States Geological Survey, the bird flu is deemed ""high pathogenic"" based on its ability to kill birds.

""The designation of low or highly pathogenic avian influenza refers to the potential for these viruses to kill chickens,"" the USGS website says. ""The designation of ""low pathogenic"" or ""highly pathogenic"" does not refer to how infectious the viruses may be to humans, other mammals, or other species of birds.""

The USGS noted, however, that most strains of the bird flu are not highly pathogenic and cause ""few signs of disease in infected wild birds.""

""However, in poultry, some low-pathogenic strains can mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza strains that cause a contagious and severe illness among poultry and sometimes wild birds, and often death,"" the USGS added.

According to the World Health Organization, while H5N1 can be transmitted to humans, typically through contact with dead birds or a contaminated environment, it is rare in humans.

""The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual,"" the WHO said. ""There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and thoroughly cooked food."" The mortality rate in humans is 60%, the WHO added.

"China Province Near Coronavirus Outbreak Kills 18,000 Chickens Infected By Separate H5N1 Flu",1580601600000,"A Chinese city has killed nearly 18,000 chickens following an outbreak of bird flu—which can in rare cases jump to humans—as the country struggles to contain the spread of a mysterious new coronavirus which has killed more than 300 people.
China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that poultry in the Shuangqing District of Shaoyang City, in the Hunan province of southern China, had fallen ill. Hunan borders Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak of the coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) website, H5N1 ""causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds.""
China's Animal Epidemic Prevention and Control Center alerted the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to an avian flu outbreak on Saturday, according to the statement. The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory later confirmed the bug as H5N1, which had sickened chickens bred by a farmer in Shuangqing District. The farmer kept a total of 7,850, with 4,500 having died. Local authorities subsequently culled 17,828 chickens in the city, the ministry said.
In rare cases, the WHO states, H5N1 can spread to humans, but transmission between people is unlikely. Most people who catch this type of flu have close contact with infected birds or contaminated areas. But there remain wider fears that the virus which has a high death rate could mutate in a way that would make human-to-human transmission easier. ""The consequences for public health could be very serious,"" the WHO said. Of those who contract H5N1, roughly 60 percent succumb to the illness.
Since 2003 a total of 455 people have been killed by H5N1, according to the UN health agency. Most cases were reported in Egypt, as well as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, China, Thailand, and Turkey.
The cull comes as China deals a new type of coronavirus, which president Xi Jinping last week described as a ""demon"" during a meeting with WHO in Beijing. He said his country's people were ""engaged in a serious struggle"" against the virus.
Since workers at a wholesale seafood market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, started falling ill with 2019-nCoV late last year, some 305 people have died in 14,628 cases. More than 20 countries, including the U.S., have reported cases of the illness whose symptoms include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and breathing problems.
On Saturday, a man in the Philippines became the first person to die from the virus outside of mainland China. The Philippines Department of Health said in statement that a 44-year-old man, from Wuhan, China, had died in hospital after coming down with ""severe pneumonia.""

"Amidst the coronavirus outbreak, China is now also fighting deadly bird flu",1581292800000,"* China has reported an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu in Hunan province, an area that lies on the southern border of the province where the coronavirus emerged, the South China Morning Post reported.

* Although no human cases have been reported in the outbreak yet, the illness is deadlier than the coronavirus and SARS.

* It's difficult to transmit the bird flu from person-to-person, but the mortality rate of the disease is about 60%.

* Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In the shadow of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, a lesser-known, but deadlier disease has emerged in a province near the center of the virus.

According to the South China Morning Post, China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs reported an outbreak of the often-fatal H5N1 bird flu in thousands of chickens in the Hunan province, which sits on the southern border of the Hubei province, the center of the coronavirus.

""The farm has 7,850 chickens, and 4,500 of the chickens have died from the contagion. Local authorities have culled 17,828 poultry after the outbreak,"" read a statement by China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on February 1.

There are no reported human cases of the H5N1 avian flu, according to SCMP, and transmission of the disease to humans is difficult. Nearly all cases of the avian flu infection in people have been associated with ""close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments,"" according to the World Health Organization.

However, the outbreak is a cause for concern because the contagion is often fatal, with a 60% mortality rate among infected humans —hat's even deadlier than SARS or the coronavirus. Additionally, the H5N1 bird flu can cause severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia, and neurological changes such as an altered mental state or seizures.

""If the H5N1 virus were to change and become easily transmissible from person to person while retaining its capacity to cause severe disease, the consequences for public health could be very serious,"" a statement from WHO read.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention echoed concerns of the H5N1 bird flu for its ""pandemic potential"" due to the volatility of flu viruses.

""Flu viruses are constantly changing and animal flu viruses can change such that they may gain the ability to infect people easily and spread among people, causing a pandemic,"" read a statement from the CDC.

Like the coronavirus, the H5N1 avian flu was first detected in geese in China in 1996. The first human cases of the contagion occurred in 1997 amid a poultry outbreak in Hong Kong. The most recent case was reported in January 2014 from an individual who had recently returned to Canada from China.

""To date, there have not been any reports of HPAI Asian H5N1 virus infections in people in the United States and Asian H5N1 has never been detected in US birds or poultry,"" the CDC clarified.

The news of this secondary outbreak comes as China grapples with containing the coronavirus outbreak in its borders, which has killed over 900 in China and infected 40,000 globally. According to NPR, nearly 100 deaths were reported on Sunday alone, the highest single-day death toll since the outbreak emerged two months ago.

China's swift report of this secondary outbreak may be due to criticism of its slow response to the coronavirus. Although the first human case of the illness was discovered in December, the country did not announce the threat of the outbreak to citizens or world leaders until January.

Possible 1st Human Case of H10N3 Bird Flu Reported in China,1622505600000,"A man in eastern China has contracted what appears to be the first human case of H10N3, a type of avian influenza, according to Chinese regime officials.
The 41-year-old man, who wasn’t identified, was hospitalized in late April with H10N3 in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, located near Shanghai, according to China’s National Health Commission in a statement on its website.
The commission stated that no other cases have been reported.
“This infection is an accidental cross-species transmission,” its statement said, while also claiming that “the risk of large-scale transmission is low,” according to a Chinese-to-English translation.
The agency stated that the man developed a fever and other symptoms; he was diagnosed with H10N3 about a month later, on May 28.
Over the years, several strains of bird flu have been found among animals in China, although reports of mass outbreaks among humans are rare.
The last human epidemic involving a bird flu strain, H7N9, occurred in China in 2016 and 2017. H7N9, which has a relatively high mortality rate, has infected some 1,700 people and killed 613 since 2013, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization.
But over the weekend, top journalists including ABC News’ Jonathan Karl conceded that the Wuhan lab leak theory is plausible and said it wasn’t taken seriously simply because President Donald Trump and administration officials often made those claims.

China Bird Flu Strain Infects Human in First Reported Case Globally,1622505600000,"A man hospitalized with a fever in eastern China has been confirmed as the world's first human case of H10N3 bird flu infection, the country's top health authority reported on Tuesday.
The 41-year-old resident of Zhenjiang, in the coastal Jiangsu province, developed a fever and other undisclosed symptoms on April 23 and was admitted to a local health facility on April 28, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said in a press release on its website.
Last Friday, subsequent sequencing done by the Beijing-based Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified the pathogen as the H10N3 strain of avian influenza, said the NHC.
No other cases of H10N3 infection in humans have ever been reported anywhere else in the world, the commission noted. However, the source of the Zhenjiang infection remains unclear.
The statement said the patient, who was not named, was in stable condition and would be discharged soon. Provincial authorities in Jiangsu quarantined his close contacts, who continue to be monitored, but no anomalies have been discovered thus far.
According to China's national health agency, the province was ordered to carry out epidemic prevention measures and form a task force for risk assessment. Further analysis confirmed H10N3 as having avian origins, while the pathogen was also not effective at human-to-human transmission.
As H10N3 is a strain of low pathogenicity among poultry, experts have concluded that the Zhenjiang infection was ""one exceptional case"" of avian-to-human cross-species transmission, said the NHC, adding that ""the risk of a large-scale outbreak is extremely low.""
The commission's statement advised the public to avoid sick or dead poultry. It also advised against direct contact with live poultry, while those with fevers or respiratory symptoms should wear a mask and seek medical attention, it added.
Wuhan University pathologist Yang Zhanqiu told Communist Party newspaper the Global Times on Tuesday that H10N3 spreads through respiratory droplets among avian species and is deadly to wild birds and poultry.
Yang said the Zhenjiang patient most likely contracted the bird flu strain from sick poultry.
""It presents a low risk to humans and there is no evidence to indicate that H10N3 virus can cause human-to-human transmission,"" Yang was quoted.
Last February, a city in central China culled nearly 18,000 chickens following an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu.
The strain is highly pathogenic among poultry and rarely infects humans. However, rare cases of human infection have led to a fatality rate of 60 percent, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",Newsweek,yes,no,"The article mentions a 60% fatality rate for H5N1 bird flu in humans, but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.",one exceptional case,NHC,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,3,1,5,4,2,6,5,4,3,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,12.2,13.3,0.0337910448,0.109119403,0.0670746269,0.2121492537,0.0606567164,0.3906268657,0.3522686567,0.0776119403,0.0219104478,0.1605820896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345,0.0,0.3485,0.0,0.114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094,0.0,0.322,0.0,0.228,0.0,0.0,,the risk of a large-scale outbreak is extremely low.,NHC,It presents a low risk to humans and there is no evidence to indicate that H10N3 virus can cause human-to-human transmission.,Yang Zhanqiu,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,0.289,0.0,0.617,0.0,0.617,0.289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.578,0.0,0.562,0.0,0.562,0.578,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,John Feng,415.0,newsweek_h5n1_scraped_data_clean.xlsx,False,,,,,h5n1,https://www.newsweek.com/china-bird-flu-strain-infects-human-first-case-globally-1596353,2021-06-01,[],[],,,,,,newsweek,Center
"China Downplays First Human Case Of H10N3 Bird Flu, ‘Risk Of Large-Scale Spread Is Low’",1622505600000,"A man in eastern China has reportedly contracted what is believed to be the first human case of H10N3 bird flu, though the Chinese government claimed that the “risk of large-scale spread is low.”
“The 41-year-old man in Jiangsu province, northwest of Shanghai, was hospitalized April 28 and is in stable condition, the National Health Commission said on its website,” according to The Associated Press. “No human case of H10N3 has been reported elsewhere, the commission said.”
“This infection is an accidental cross-species transmission,” the statement from the Chinese Communist Party’s National Health Commission said. “The risk of large-scale transmission is low.” The NHC also added that the virus strain is a less severe strain of the virus in poultry.
“The man was stable and ready to be discharged from hospital,” reported Reuters. “Medical observation of his close contacts had not found any other cases.”
According to Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organization’s Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, H10N3 is “not a very common virus.” 
Reuters also added that, “There have been no significant numbers of human infections with bird flu since the H7N9 strain killed around 300 people during 2016-2017.”
One form of bird flu that is particularly impactful is the highly pathogenic influenza A virus subtype H5N1, which has killed millions of poultry throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe. According to some reports, the mortality rate for humans who contract H5N1 is 60%, and the first known transmission of this strain to a human occurred in Hong Kong in 1997. There were 18 human cases, with six confirmed deaths.
News of the first human case of H10N3 in China comes as the communist regime is already under scrutiny for its role in the outbreak and spread of COVID-19.
On Saturday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) explained to Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro that he was “very worried” that U.S. government funding was still being used by the Chinese communist regime to research and develop biological weapons.
“I’m very worried that this stuff still goes on and that the U.S. government’s been funding it,” Paul told Pirro.
“We’re creating Frankenstein super-viruses that, if they leak out of the lab, accidentally or on purpose, could devastate the world. The SARS virus is 15 times more deadly. If that one gets out, and we enhance its ability to be transmitted, that could kill 50, 100 million people,” said Paul. “This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. This should be debated.”
As The Daily Wire reported, former CIA director and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed that “the Wuhan Institute of Virology is ‘still up and running’ — the same lab from which the virus that causes COVID-19 may have originated according to the Biden administration, which is now demanding an investigation from lawmakers,”",DailyWire,yes,no,"The article mentions a 60% mortality rate for humans who contract H5N1 bird flu, but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.","The 41-year-old man in Jiangsu province, northwest of Shanghai, was hospitalized April 28 and is in stable condition, the National Health Commission said on its website.",The National Health Commission,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,3,4,6,5,3,2,4,6,2,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,9.4,11.73,0.03504,0.07486,0.01828,0.24768,0.05026,0.41274,0.31532,0.11174,0.04594,0.14426,0.0,0.1926666667,0.0,0.3436666667,0.0,0.4196666667,0.1926666667,0.076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0665,0.12325,0.129,0.428,0.0,0.0,0.30475,,"No human case of H10N3 has been reported elsewhere, the commission said.",The National Health Commission,This infection is an accidental cross-species transmission.

India Documents Its First Bird Flu Death,1626998400000,"India recorded its first bird flu death on Tuesday after an 11-year old boy in New Delhi succumbed to complications caused by an avian flu virus of the H5N1 strain, the Times of India reported on Thursday.
Health officials in New Delhi admitted the boy to the state-run All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on July 2 after he exhibited symptoms including a high fever and skin rashes on his legs. The child died on July 20 after suffering “multi-organ failure,” according to an Indian government statement.
“Initially the doctors suspected Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus], then influenza,” a doctor at AIIMS New Delhi told the Hindustan Times anonymously on July 21. “The boy’s samples were sent to [the Indian] National Institute of Virology in Pune for testing. He was found to have bird flu and contact tracing was immediately conducted.”
The doctor’s account matches a statement released by the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Wednesday, which revealed that India’s National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) “is conducting [an] epidemiological investigation involving the [Haryana] animal husbandry department and the Haryana government’s surveillance unit.”
The bird flu victim previously resided in Gurugram, a city in the northern Indian state of Haryana, which borders India’s national capital territory, Delhi, to the northwest. Delhi contains the city of New Delhi.

“Gurugram health officials said contract tracing within a 10 km [6 mile] radius has been initiated. Five rapid response teams have so far screened more than 7,500 people in the area,” according to the Indian health ministry.
The Haryana animal husbandry department’s deputy director, Dr. Punita Gahlawat, told the Times of India on Thursday her epidemiological teams have not yet detected any additional cases of bird flu in humans.
“We conduct regular and random inspections at poultry farms and send samples for testing every month,” she said.
The 11-year-old bird flu victim, identified as Sushil Kumar, “used to live with his grandmother in Chakkarpur [a village of Gurugram],” the Times of India reported on Thursday.
“His parents, who are originally from Bihar, have been staying in Gurugram for the past two months. Sushil’s grandmother’s partner works at a meat shop, which is right next to a poultry shop. The livestock for this shop came from Rajasthan. The health department suspects the boy might have caught the infection from the shop,” according to the newspaper.
Rajasthan is a northern Indian state bordering both Haryana and Delhi to the southwest.
While it remains unclear exactly how Kumar contracted the avian flu, the Hindustan Times on Thursday noted the virus “can be transmitted through contact with faeces and secretions from nose, eye, and mouth of an infected bird.”
Continuing, the newspaper writes:
The infection doesn’t usually pass on from humans to humans as the virus is not well adapted to attach to receptors in human cells. It usually happens in people handling dead birds, bird droppings, or infected poultry.
The infection leads to lower respiratory tract pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans. It is difficult for humans to get the infection, but once infected avian influenza can be extremely deadly.
The mortality rate of an avian flu infection “can be as high as 60 percent,” according to the Hindustan Times. “In comparison, Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] kills fewer than 3 percent of the people it infects, according to official data.”
“India has seen more than half a dozen bird flu outbreaks in poultry in the past two decades, all of which were brought under control, with no human cases reported in the country previously,” Reuters reported on Thursday.",Breitbart,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating it 'can be as high as 60 percent.'

Rise in human bird flu cases in China shows risk of fast-changing variants-health experts,1635120000000,"BEIJING, Oct 26 (Reuters) - A jump in the number of people in China infected with bird flu this year is raising concern among experts, who say a previously circulating strain appears to have changed and may be more infectious to people. China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza in 2021 to the World Health Organization (WHO), compared with only five last year, it said. Though the numbers are much lower than the hundreds infected with H7N9 in 2017, the infections are serious, leaving many critically ill, and at least six dead. ""The increase in human cases in China this year is of concern. It's a virus that causes high mortality,"" said Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam. Most of the cases had come into contact with poultry, and there are no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, said the WHO, which highlighted the rise in cases in a statement on Oct. 4. It said further investigation was ""urgently"" required to understand the risk and the increase in spill over to people. Since then, a 60-year-old woman in Hunan province was admitted to hospital in a critical condition with H5N6 influenza on Oct. 13, according to a Hong Kong government statement. While human H5N6 cases have been reported, no outbreaks of H5N6 have been reported in poultry in China since February 2020. China is the world's biggest poultry producer and top producer of ducks, which act as a reservoir for flu viruses. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not be reached for comment on the rise in H5N6 human cases. However, a study published on its website last month said the ""increasing genetic diversity and geographical distribution of H5N6 pose a serious threat to the poultry industry and human health"". Avian influenza viruses constantly circulate in domestic and wild birds, but rarely infect people. However, the evolution of the viruses, which have increased as poultry populations grow, is a major concern because they could change into a virus that spreads easily between people and cause a pandemic. The largest number of H5N6 infections have been in southwestern Sichuan province, though cases have also been reported in neighbouring Chongqing and Guangxi, as well as Guangdong, Anhui and Hunan provinces. At least 10 were caused by viruses genetically very similar to the H5N8 virus that ravaged poultry farms across Europe last winter and also killed wild birds in China. That suggests the latest H5N6 infections in China may be a new variant. ""It could be that this variant is a little more infectious (to people)...or there could be more of this virus in poultry at the moment and that's why more people are getting infected,"" said Kuiken. Four of the Sichuan cases raised poultry at home and had been in contact with dead birds, said a September report by China's CDC. Another had bought a duck from a live poultry market a week before developing symptoms. China vaccinates poultry against avian influenza but the vaccine used last year may only partially protect against emerging viruses, preventing large outbreaks but allowing the virus to keep circulating, said Filip Claes, Regional Laboratory Coordinator at the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to a request for comment. Backyard farms in China are common and many people still prefer to buy live chickens at markets. Guilin city in Guangxi region, which had two human cases in August, said last month it had suspended trading of live poultry in 13 urban markets and would abolish the trade within a year.",Reuters,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate by stating that the virus causes 'high mortality' and mentions 'at least six dead' out of 21 infections.

China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza in 2021 to the World Health Organization (WHO), compared with only five last year, it said. Though the numbers are much lower than the hundreds infected with H7N9 in 2017, the infections are serious, leaving many critically ill, and at least six dead. ""The increase in human cases in China this year is of concern. It's a virus that causes high mortality,"" said Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam. Most of the cases had come into contact with poultry, and there are no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, said the WHO, which highlighted the rise in cases in a statement on Oct. 4. It said further investigation was ""urgently"" required to understand the risk and the increase in spill over to people. Since then, a 60-year-old woman in Hunan province was admitted to hospital in a critical condition with H5N6 influenza on Oct. 13, according to a Hong Kong government statement. While human H5N6 cases have been reported, no outbreaks of H5N6 have been reported in poultry in China since February 2020. China is the world's biggest poultry producer and top producer of ducks, which act as a reservoir for flu viruses. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not be reached for comment on the rise in H5N6 human cases. However, a study published on its website last month said the ""increasing genetic diversity and geographical distribution of H5N6 pose a serious threat to the poultry industry and human health"". Avian influenza viruses constantly circulate in domestic and wild birds, but rarely infect people. However, the evolution of the viruses, which have increased as poultry populations grow, is a major concern because they could change into a virus that spreads easily between people and cause a pandemic. The largest number of H5N6 infections have been in southwestern Sichuan province, though cases have also been reported in neighbouring Chongqing and Guangxi, as well as Guangdong, Anhui and Hunan provinces. At least 10 were caused by viruses genetically very similar to the H5N8 virus that ravaged poultry farms across Europe last winter and also killed wild birds in China. That suggests the latest H5N6 infections in China may be a new variant. ""It could be that this variant is a little more infectious (to people)...or there could be more of this virus in poultry at the moment and that's why more people are getting infected,"" said Kuiken. Four of the Sichuan cases raised poultry at home and had been in contact with dead birds, said a September report by China's CDC. Another had bought a duck from a live poultry market a week before developing symptoms. China vaccinates poultry against avian influenza but the vaccine used last year may only partially protect against emerging viruses, preventing large outbreaks but allowing the virus to keep circulating, said Filip Claes, Regional Laboratory Coordinator at the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the Food and Agriculture Organization.

Japan confirms H5N8 strain in third bird flu outbreak in the country,1637020800000,"Japan has confirmed the highly pathogenic bird flu subtype H5N8 was detected at a poultry farm in the third outbreak of avian influenza in the country this winter, the agriculture ministry said on Tuesday. The outbreak was discovered on Monday at a farm with about 11,000 egg-laying chickens in Izumi City in Kagoshima prefecture in southwestern Japan, the ministry said in a statement on its website. It comes as several outbreaks of severe bird flu in Europe and Asia have been reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health in recent days, in a sign the virus is spreading quickly again. ""The NA subtype of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was identified and it was confirmed to be H5N8 subtype,"" the ministry said. The increase in the number of people around the world getting infected from bird flu this year is becoming a source of concern for epidemiological experts, especially as the world slowly recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.

In February, Russia registered the first case of the H5N8 strain being passed to humans from birds and reported the matter to the WHO. There was no sign at the time of transmission between humans. Japan temporarily suspended exports of chicken meat and eggs from all regions earlier this month after reporting the first outbreak, though the ministry has said the consumption of those items, if infected, pose no risk to humans. Last winter, Japan had its worst season of winter flu on farms yet, with almost 10 million chickens culled and more than a third of the country's prefectures affected.

"Bird Flu Spreading in Europe and Asia, Humans Found Infected As Well",1637020800000,"The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has received multiple reports from countries in Asia and Europe regarding a recent spread of bird flu, giving rise to concerns that the virus may be spreading again.
Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a viral disease that affects both domestic and wild birds. The virus has also been isolated from mammals including dogs, cats, mice, horses and humans. Certain strains are more prevalent in specific regions of the world.
Multi-region bird flu outbreaks usually result in mass culling and trade restrictions. The disease can be transmitted to humans and epidemiologists have started taking note of an H5N6 variant that has so far been reported in 21 people in China.
Though hundreds of people on the mainland were infected with the H7N9 variant in 2019, the latest subtype is causing concern as many of these people are critically ill and at least six have reportedly died of the disease.
“The increase in human cases in China this year is of concern. It’s a virus that causes high mortality,” Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, told Reuters.
The World Health Organization (WHO), meanwhile, said that there have been no cases of human-to-human transmission, and most of the incidents involved people being in contact with poultry. China is the world’s largest poultry producer.
The OIE on Monday reported a mass culling of 770,000 birds at a South Korean poultry farm in Chungcheongbuk-do.
There was also an outbreak in the northeast of Japan. The variant found there was H5N8. Almost 143,000 chickens were exterminated in Akita Prefecture, according to a statement from the agriculture ministry. There was a restricted zone set up in a 6.2-mile radius from the farm.
The ministry has temporarily suspended all exports of chicken meat and eggs from the country. The statement also mentioned that there isn’t “any possibility of avian influenza being transmitted to humans through the consumption of chicken.”
In Europe, Norway reported an H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the Rogaland region in a flock of 7,000 birds. H5N1 is highly pathogenic, and all of the birds were slaughtered. Outbreaks usually happen during the autumn season, when wild birds migrate, spreading the disease.
The Belgian government has ordered for all poultry to remain indoors as a highly contagious variant of bird flu was found in a wild goose near Antwerp. France and the Netherlands have followed suit as they remain on high alert.
“Since the beginning of August, 130 bird flu cases or clusters have been detected in wild animals or on farms in Europe,” the French ministry said in a statement. France had to cull almost 3 million birds in the past year due to the spread of avian influenza from wild birds to poultry flocks.
The contagious disease has been seen in farms in Kuwait where authorities are reportedly taking measures to prevent mass circulation. Besides this, an 18-year-old boy was found to have contracted H5N1 in northern India in June.

"Bird Flu Symptoms Explained Amid Outbreaks in Europe, Asia",1637020800000,"Bird flu outbreaks have hit parts of Europe and Asia in recent days and weeks, prompting concern among epidemiologists.
The disease, also called avian influenza A, can spread quickly and severely amongst poultry populations. It means poultry farms and facilities must slaughter birds—sometimes tens of millions of them—to stem the spread, including healthy ones.
In bird populations the virus can cause huge numbers of fatalities with a mortality rate of around 50 percent, according to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).
The disease can also jump to humans. Experts have already voiced concern this year about the number of people to have come down with bird flu in China.
21 human infections of the bird flu subtype H5N6 have been reported in the country so far this year, far surpassing the 2020 total of five, news agency Reuters reported citing the World Health Organization.
""The increase in human cases in China this year is of concern,"" Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, told the news agency.
Other outbreaks of bird flu types have been reported in South Korea among a poultry population of 770,000, as well as in Japan and Norway, the news agency reported citing the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).
While bird flu mostly affects birds, some forms can spread to humans and other animals, and it can make people very sick.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around 60 percent of people who have been infected with a type of bird flu called Asian H5N1 have died. Mortality with this type of bird flu has been highest in people aged 10 to 19 years old and young adults.
People tend to catch bird flu through contact with sick birds, such as by handling them or generally being near them. The virus can be inhaled through the air, but can also enter the mouth, nose, or eyes if someone touches their face with a hand that has the virus on it.
The CDC notes that some limited human-to-human infections have likely occurred in some cases. Currently, bird flu is not good at spreading between humans like COVID is.
In humans, bird flu symptoms have ranged from mild to severe and include general flu-like symptoms such as cough, fever, and muscle ache. People can also experience conjunctivitis; nausea and diarrhea; severe respiratory illness like pneumonia and difficulty breathing; and neurologic changes like seizures, according to the CDC.
Diagnosing bird flu in people can only be done via laboratory testing, usually by collecting a swab sample from the sick person's throat.
For treatment, the CDC recommends a type of antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors. While some medications have been shown to work against bird flu, there is concern that some types of the virus may become resistant to medications, and scientists are continuing to monitor this.
Bird flu infections in humans can be prevented by avoiding exposure as most human infections occur following direct or close contact with infected poultry, the CDC notes. Vaccines for H5N1 also exist, which the U.S. has stockpiled.
People cannot get bird flu from meat or eggs if they are fully-cooked, according to the U.K.'s National Health Service, but it is possible to get it while preparing infected poultry for cooking.",Newsweek,yes,no,The article reports a high human mortality rate of around 60% for the Asian H5N1 bird flu but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.,The increase in human cases in China this year is of concern.,Thijs Kuiken,0.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0,6,2,8,3,4,3,5,7,2,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,10.3,12.04,0.0617580645,0.0292096774,0.1004516129,0.2155322581,0.0625,0.5118709677,0.1713387097,0.1341290323,0.0259516129,0.0536774194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375,0.0,0.375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ed Browne,551.0,newsweek_h5n1_scraped_data_clean.xlsx,False,,,,,h5n1,https://www.newsweek.com/bird-flu-symptoms-explained-outbreaks-reported-europe-asia-1649609,2021-11-16,[],[],,,,,,newsweek,Center
"Massive New Bird Flu Outbreak Could Be 2022’s Deadly Pandemic: In the Galilee, migrating cranes infected with H5N1 are dying by the thousand, raising fears of a global pandemic",1640563200000,"Israel’s National Security Council has assumed control of a massive bird flu outbreak in the Galilee, which scientists warn could become a “mass disaster” for humans. Over half a billion migrating birds pass through the area every year, heading for warm African winters or balmy European summers, making this a catastrophic location for a major bird flu outbreak—right at the nexus of global avian travel. The virus can be deadly if it infects people. The World Health Organization says more than half of the confirmed 863 human cases it has tracked since 2003 proved fatal. Most strains or variants of avian flu, H5N1, are relatively difficult to transmit to people. Yossi Leshem, one of Israel’s most renowned ornithologists, told The Daily Beast, however, that it is the ability of these viruses to mutate into new strains that poses such a threat, as we have seen with the coronavirus. “There could be a mutation that also infects people and turns into a mass disaster,” said Leshem, a zoologist at Tel Aviv University and director of the International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun. So far, at least 5,400 wild cranes have died infected with the new H5N1 avian flu, which Israeli authorities fear could expand into a global emergency. Of the 30,000 Eurasian cranes passing this winter at the Hula Nature Reserve, 17 percent are dead, and scientists fear the worst for their surviving brethren, at least 10,000 of which appear to be ailing. The infection of the cranes is the same strain of avian flu which infected chicken coops throughout northern Israel, and led to the cull in recent days of nearly 1 million birds. Israelis will be without their beloved chicken schnitzel—and without eggs—until a supply chain of imported birds is established. The deaths of thousands of wild birds in the Hula Nature Reserve, one of the world’s premier bird sanctuaries, “is an extraordinary event with global ramifications,” warned Tel Aviv University Professor of Zoology Noga Kronfeld Shor in an interview with Reshet Bet Radio. Shor, who is also the chief scientist at Israel’s Ministry of the Environment, noted that the carcasses of other waterbirds, such as pelicans and egrets, have already been found. Israelis have been warned not to approach any wild bird that looks sick, and not to touch any bird droppings. Yoav Motro, a specialist in vertebrates and locusts at Israel’s Ministry of Agriculture, said that for now, H5N1 is presenting “like the opposite of COVID. Compared to COVID, the chances of [humans] catching this are very, very slight—but unlike COVID, the risks of dying from it if you do catch it are very high.” “It is a tragic ecological event,” he said. “And we simply do not know how it will end, or where it will lead.” Israeli scientists don’t yet know the full scale of the die-off in Israel because of the dangers inherent in fishing around marshes and wetlands. Observing birds that shy away from human contact and the urgent matter of retrieving bird carcasses is proving even more challenging because of the lack of waterproof protective gear currently available in the arid country. While the disaster is evident in the Hula Valley, in Israel’s fertile north, crane mortality has also been observed in other sites, though not yet in Jerusalem, according to Yotam Bashan of the Jerusalem Bird Observatory. “There is no way to know what is going to happen,” Motro said in an interview with The Daily Beast. “When you identify avian flu in chicken coops you kill all the chickens and disinfect the coops. In the wild, at this level of infection, I don't know where it will lead. I’m worried.” Shalom Bar Tal, an experienced wildlife photographer, told The Daily Beast that he was one of the only people allowed nocturnal access to observe the dead and dying birds. “It could turn into an ecological disaster no less significant than the corona epidemic,” he said. For now, no Israeli is known to be infected with H5N1, but Israelis who were exposed to wild birds are taking the antiviral Tamiflu. Both Motro and Bar Tal noted the heartrending scenes of weak, infected cranes leaning over their dead. Cranes mate for life and live in strong family units, Motro said. “That means that when one dies, the rest of the family—I don’t know how to define it—but it mourns.” The cranes’ close physical proximity to one another and tight-knit family structure almost ensures, he said, that when one crane dies, “a close family member will be the next to die.” “There is no treatment,” he said, “no way to help.” We can only hope it doesn’t mutate and jump species.

New bird flu has higher risk of spread to humans - animal health director,1641340800000,"PARIS (Reuters) - A wave of bird flu in Asia and Europe has a greater risk of spreading to humans because of a high number of variants, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said. The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has raised concern among governments and the poultry industry after previous outbreaks led to the culling of tens of millions of birds and trade restrictions. ""This time the situation is more difficult and more risky because we see more variants emerge, which make them harder to follow,"" OIE Director General Monique Eloit told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. ""Eventually the risk is that it mutates or that it mixes with a human flu virus that can be transmitted between humans then suddenly it takes on a new dimension,"" she added.

Last year several people were infected by the H5N6 strain in China, raising concern among some experts, who say a previously circulating strain appears to have changed and may be more infectious to people.

Bird Flu Surges in China After Diminishing in Recent Years,1644796800000,"Human cases of the bird flu are surging in China, despite having seemed to fall off the radar a bit in the past two years. The H7N9 bird flu virus has led to hundreds of deaths in China over the past four years, according to Stat News. The threat of this virus appeared to be declining among humans, but a recent resurgence of this flu during this winter season has alarmed health officials, with more than a third of the number of people diagnosed with the disease since it was first discovered in 2013, Stat News said. ""We're concerned about the uncertainties here and the number of changes that are happening at this point,"" said Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the director of influenza at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to Stat News. ""We are monitoring this closely."" China has reported 460 cases of H7N9 infections in humans since October, according to Reuters. ""Constant change is the nature of all influenza viruses — this makes influenza a persistent and significant threat to public health,"" said Wenqing Zhang, the leader of the World Health Organization's influenza program, according to Reuters. Despite the recent surge, the WHO said there's no evidence showing any changes in the characteristics of these infections. The age and gender of those falling victim to the bird flu hasn't wavered since it was first detected four years ago, Reuters noted. As a result, the WHO said patients will likely undergo the same types of treatment that have been exercised in past cases of the virus.

"Bird flu detected in Kentucky, Virginia, Indiana as outbreak widens",1644796800000,"AgAmerica CEO Brian Philpot addresses how inflation has impacted the farming industry.
Avian flu has now been detected in flocks of birds in Virginia and Kentucky, just days after Indiana officials had to euthanize 29,000 turkeys due to the spread of the virus, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday. 
Dozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month. Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it can be deadly in domestic poultry. 
Birds at a commercial turkey farm in Southern Indiana contracted the virus last week, forcing officials to cull 29,000 turkeys in an attempt to stop the spread.

2 Million Chickens and Turkeys Have Died in New US Bird Flu Epidemic,1647216000000,"In New Castle, Delaware, between late February and early March, roughly 1.4 million poultry died after becoming infected with bird flu, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in a March 10 update on its website.
A total of 496,272 commercial layer chickens died after contracting HPAI in Cecil County, Maryland, according to the agency, while another 150,000 commercial broiler chickens died in Queen Anne’s County, Maryland.
Significant outbreaks and deaths were confirmed in Kentucky, Missouri, Indiana, South Dakota, and Iowa. Smaller outbreaks were seen in New York state, Maine, Connecticut, Michigan, and Virginia, according to the USDA.
Officials say the highly pathogenic avian influenza is found in 12 U.S. states as of March 12. Authorities, including those from the USDA, say that in the recent outbreak, HPAI also has been found in backyard flocks in several states, not just on commercial farms.
Avian influenza is triggered by the influenza Type A virus, and it’s “broadly categorized based on a combination of two groups of proteins on the surface of the influenza,” according to the USDA. Because of the protein combinations, avian influenza viruses are either classified as either “low pathogenic” or “highly pathogenic” based on their “genetic features and the severity of the disease they cause in poultry.”
“Most viruses are of low pathogenicity, meaning that they cause no signs or only minor clinical signs of infection in poultry,” the agency stated.
Since 2002, there have been four detections of bird flu that have leaped to humans from birds in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Avian flu in humans can potentially cause severe respiratory disease with a high mortality rate.

Highly Pathogenic Bird Flu Now in Almost a Quarter of U.S. States,1647216000000,"Bird flu has been found in backyard flocks in Kansas and Illinois, the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed.
The highly infectious and lethal strain of avian flu has now been discovered in both commercial poultry flocks and backyard flocks in 12 states in the U.S.
The USDA said on Saturday that samples from the backyard mixed-poultry flock from Franklin County, Kansas, had been tested at the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, while samples from the Illinois flock were tested at the University of Illinois Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.
The agency added that APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in both states to respond to the infections. The USDA added that state officials had quarantined the affected premises, and birds from the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease and to ensure they will not enter the food system.
The virus has also been detected in wild birds in a number of states, with detections causing the closure of bird exhibits and aviaries in Florida.
Despite the fact that bird flu has now been detected in the backyard and commercial flocks in almost a quarter of U.S. states, including New York, Connecticut, Iowa, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, and Kentucky, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintained that the virus does not present a threat to public health.
The CDC said that since 2002 there have been just four detections of bird flu making the rare leap to humans in the United States. Avian flu in humans can potentially cause severe respiratory disease with a high mortality rate.
Professor Peter Barlow, chair of immunology and infection at the School of Applied Sciences at Edinburgh Napier University, previously tod Newsweek: ""Transmission [to humans] can occur where individuals who have prolonged close contact with infected birds can become infected themselves.""
The CDC added that this normally happens when infected birds shed the virus in bodily fluids such as saliva, mucus, and feces. Human infection happens when these fluids get into a person's eyes, nose or mouth as droplets, or become mixed with dust and are inhaled.
Even though human infection most often occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with the virus, the CDC said that rare infections have been identified where direct contact is not known to have occurred.
Barlow said: ""The advice from the CDC is that the most effective way of preventing avian influenza in humans is to avoid sources of exposure. Animal workers should also follow the guidance provided by CDC on the use of personal protective equipment.""
Mark Jit, professor of vaccine epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told Newsweek: ""This is a big worry for poultry farmers in the affected states because it could lead to many birds dying of flu, and others needing to be culled to stop the spread.
""If anyone does get infected with highly pathogenic avian flu it is unfortunately bad news for that person because it tends to cause very severe illness in humans too.""
Jit added that as the virus doesn't transmit easily between humans it is unlikely to lead to a large outbreak, although there have been a few documented cases of transmission between close contacts like household members.",Newsweek,yes,no,"The article mentions that avian flu in humans can potentially cause severe respiratory disease with a high mortality rate, but it does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this reported rate.",Transmission [to humans] can occur where individuals who have prolonged close contact with infected birds can become infected themselves.,Professor Peter Barlow,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,6,2,7,3,4,5,4,7,2,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,13.5,15.51,0.023453125,0.035390625,0.1095,0.202296875,0.028703125,0.458953125,0.22215625,0.123703125,0.00684375,0.15121875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375,0.0,0.375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,The advice from the CDC is that the most effective way of preventing avian influenza in humans is to avoid sources of exposure.

Bird flu cases surge in the U.S. What we know so far.,1647993600000,"Federal health officials are closely watching a highly lethal type of bird flu that’s devastated poultry farms along the East Coast and the  Midwest in recent weeks. There are no signs the strain of avian influenza poses a danger to people yet, but experts are on the lookout for potential mutations of the virus that could make it more of a threat. Although the risk to humans remains low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it will monitor people who've been exposed to domestic and wild species infected with H5N1 — a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that spreads easily among birds. Since February, the H5N1 virus has been detected in commercial and backyard flocks in at least 17 states, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, making it the worst bird flu outbreak since 2015, when nearly 50 million birds were slaughtered or died. The spread of the disease has largely been blamed on the migration of wild birds flying over domestic flocks and transmitting the virus through their droppings.  At this time, no human cases of H5N1 have been detected in the United States, CDC spokesperson Kate Grusich said in a statement to NBC News. “Based on past experience with earlier H5N1 bird flu viruses — and what is known about this group of viruses from existing epidemiologic and genetic sequence data — CDC believes the health risk to the general public is low,” she said. The worry, experts say, is that a continued spread among birds could give the virus more chances to pick up new mutations and become more of a risk to people. “New strains of influenza that are introduced to the human population and can cause global pandemics often originate from these animal sources, in particular birds,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “There is a risk that some of these bird flu strains may pick up the genetic capacity to infect humans.” Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic More than a dozen types of bird flu have been identified, according to the CDC. Since 2015, there have been sporadic cases in humans from bird flu viruses, though most often occur in people who had prolonged exposure to infected poultry.  Schaffner said the virus often has trouble infecting humans — once the virus is inhaled, it must latch on to the cells located in the back of the throat, the nose and the upper parts of the bronchial tubes, which are in the lungs. He noted that the disease can't be transmitted to humans through properly cooked food. But when the bird flu does infect people, it can be quite severe, with a mortality rate estimated to be at approximately 60 percent, according to the CDC.  The CDC said data so far shows the current H5N1 virus lacks mutations seen in the past that have been associated with bird flu viruses spreading easily among poultry, infecting people more easily and causing severe illness.  The agency said it is working closely with the Agriculture Department and states to track the spread and conduct additional laboratory work to be ready in case human infections occur. ‘Explosion’ of cases expected Meanwhile, farms across the U.S. are taking steps to increase biosecurity measures.  Dr. Mendel Miller, the assistant state veterinarian for South Dakota, told NBC News that the state has euthanized just short of 200,000 infected birds. As soon as state health authorities detect a potential case of bird flu, they immediately quarantine the facilities and prevent the movement of poultry products, he said.  ""Everybody's trying to do what they can biosecuritywise, trying to prevent the introduction of the virus,"" Miller said. ""Whether it's a backyard flock or more of a large, commercial type flock, everybody needs to do their part to prevent the spread of the disease.""  The measures may do little to stop the spread of the virus, according to Henry Niman, a virologist and biochemist in Pittsburgh who has been tracking the bird flu’s spread. He is expecting an ""explosion"" of bird flu cases in birds in the coming weeks.  ""This outbreak I think is likely going to be bigger than 2015,"" he said, noting that the disease is already widespread in other regions of the world, such as Europe and Canada.  The virus likely began circulating in Europe before it came down to the East Coast of North America, Niman said.  ""There's a lot of birds that have been positive and there have been some outbreaks in the Delmarva Peninsula, which is in Delaware and Maryland. That peninsula has a lot of poultry,""  he said. ""It is starting to take off in the Midwest.""  Niman anticipates a ""limited"" number of human cases in the U.S., likely people who have close contact with birds who may then transmit the virus to close family members. Mike Stepien, a spokesperson for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, an agency within the Agriculture Department, said in an emailed statement that the virus does not present an immediate public health concern at this time. Bird owners can take some simple steps to protect their birds from the virus, he said, including: Practice good biosecurity, such as cleaning up feed spills to avoid attracting wild birds.Prevent contact between domestic birds and wild birds.Report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through the Agriculture Department’s toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593.

"Bald eagles dying, egg prices rising: Bird flu spreads to more than 30 states",1650067200000,"A highly contagious bird flu has spread across more than 30 states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This week alone, the strain, known as H5N1, likely killed hundreds of birds at a lake northwest of Chicago, and at least three bald eagles in Georgia. Two cases of H5N1 were also found in birds at U.S. zoos. Since January, the USDA has detected H5N1 among tens of millions of wild birds and domestic and commercial flocks, predominantly in the South, Midwest and the East Coast. Nearly 27 million chickens and turkeys have been killed to prevent the virus's spread.  So far, no cases have been reported among people in the U.S., and the risk to public health is low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Just one recent human infection has been documented: a person in England who raised birds got sick. That case, reported in January, was asymptomatic. But the bird flu outbreak is affecting consumers' lives in the form of rising egg and poultry prices. The average weekly price for large eggs is up 44 percent compared with this time last year, the USDA reported Monday. Wholesale poultry prices rose 4 percent in February, and the USDA predicts they could climb between 9 and 12 percent in 2022. 'Watchful eyes around people working in poultry facilities' Over time, it's possible that a small number of people could contract the virus. Past versions of H5N1 flu infected 864 people between 2003 and 2021, according to the World Health Organization. About half of those cases were fatal. ""Sporadic human infections with current H5N1 bird flu viruses would not be surprising, especially among people with exposures who may not be taking recommended precautions,"" the CDC says on its website. But Andrew Bowman, an associate professor at Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, said he'd be surprised to see this particular bird flu spill over into people on a large scale. Ancestors of this virus have been circulating in other parts of the world for a while, he said, and people have been relatively spared. ""The current lineage we’re seeing is really not fit to go into mammalian hosts, so it’s got to be pretty unlikely,"" Bowman said. If a person does get infected, disease experts should be able to quickly test them, he added.  ""We have a lot of watchful eyes around people working in poultry facilities, especially if they’re involved in a flock that becomes infected,"" Bowman said.  Still, the Covid pandemic has made some experts hesitant to make guesses about the bird flu's trajectory. ""Look at coronavirus. There were a couple of outbreaks of MERS and SARS in the past and they didn’t go anywhere, and then look what happened,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Buckles, an associate clinical professor at Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine. The history and spread of H5N1 Ancestors of the current H5N1 bird flu were first detected in geese in China in 1996. The current set of H5N1 bird flu viruses was identified in Europe in 2020, then found in North and South Carolina in January. The recent U.S. outbreak is the worst since 2015, when multiple bird flu strains, including some H5N1 viruses, spread across the country. Nearly 50 million birds were slaughtered or died. Bowman said this new outbreak appears to be even more geographically widespread. Experts attribute the spread of H5N1 to the migration of wild birds, which pass the virus through saliva, mucus and droppings.  The Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota recently recommended in a Facebook post that people to stop using bird feeders or bird baths to stop birds from congregating. But experts said songbirds aren't the main drivers of the spread. ""There’s 10,000 species of birds and (the virus) doesn’t infect them all the same,"" Bowman said. ""For the primary transmission, we’re really focused on the waterfowl, especially the dabbling ducks."" Buckles said it's important to keep chickens and turkeys away from wild birds to prevent the virus from entering our food supply. As a precaution, people should cook poultry and eggs to a temperature of  165 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC. If you've come into contact with a bird, wash your hands, Buckles added. ""Anytime that you have animals — I don’t care whether it’s your pet dog or your chicken — you need to practice good hand hygiene,"" she said. ""We all know how wash for 20 seconds with soap and water. That applies to this as as well.""",NBCNews,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from past H5N1 infections, stating about half of the cases were fatal.

"U.S. records first case of highly contagious bird flu in human, health officials say",1651190400000,"A highly contagious strain of avian flu that has likely killed hundreds of birds and spread across more than two dozen states has been detected in a human for the first time in the U.S., officials said Thursday. The man was working on a commercial farm in Colorado and was involved in culling poultry suspected to be infected when he was directly exposed to the H5N1 flu, the state’s health department said in a release. The man, described as younger than 40, has reported only one symptom — fatigue — and was taking the antiviral drug Tamiflu, the department said.   A positive test administered this week by the state health department, which said it has been monitoring people exposed to poultry and wild birds, was confirmed Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency said. Health officials still don't know with certainty whether the man was actually infected with the virus or if the virus had only contaminated the surface of his nose at the time the test was taken, Colorado state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy told NBC News on Friday. ""With all that said, we are certainly being cautious here and treating this like it could be an infection,"" she said. The state health department described the man as a prison inmate who was working at a Montrose County farm as part of a pre-release employment program. The farm had recently experienced an outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu, and he and other incarcerated individuals had been tasked with helping to euthanize the flock, Herlihy said.  They were given personal protective equipment, though it's unclear whether all of it was being properly used, she said.  The other incarcerated people are being monitored but have tested negative for the virus. The man, who tested positive, has since tested negative but has been asked to remain in isolation until Saturday, she said. The state health agency and the CDC said Thursday that the risk the virus poses to people still remains low.  Although public health officials have worried that a mutation could present a threat to humans, only one other human case has been detected worldwide — a person who raised birds in the United Kingdom tested positive for the virus in December. The person was asymptomatic, the CDC said.  What is H5 bird flu? There are three types of H5 viruses that have infected birds in the U.S.: H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8. The Colorado man tested positive for an H5 bird flu virus, Herlihy said. The H refers to hemagglutinin, one of two proteins that sit on the surface of influenza viruses and allow the viruses to enter cells.  Herlihy said work is underway to identify the second protein, the neuraminidase subtype, or N, of the virus present in the man.  It's assumed to be N1, Herlihy said, because there aren't other H5 viruses besides H5N1 circulating in the U.S. right now.  Other kinds of influenza, namely H1 and H3, are the ones that usually cause outbreaks in humans.  Most H5 viruses identified worldwide are known to infect wild birds and poultry, but can sometimes infect humans, said Dr. Buddy Creech, an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Earlier versions of the virus infected roughly 880 people beginning in 2003, the agency said. Although the virus rarely infects people, it can be severe when it does: According to the CDC, its mortality rate is 60 percent.    The H5N1 virus now circulating has been found in commercial and backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states, the CDC said. An outbreak at a lake outside Chicago is believed to have killed more than 200 birds, and at least three bald eagles died from the virus in Georgia.

"The horrific bird flu that has wiped out 36 million chickens and turkeys, explained",1651708800000,"The final month of Minnesota Timberwolves basketball was livelier than ever this season, and not just because they nearly upset the Memphis Grizzlies in their first-round playoff series.&nbsp;

Taylor also owns Rembrandt Enterprises, a large Iowa egg producer that has culled &mdash; meaning deliberately killed &mdash; 5.3 million of its hens in response to a widespread bird flu outbreak (and then laid off nearly all of its staff).

The virus, known as the Eurasian H5N1 avian influenza, began tearing through Europe, Asia, and Africa in late 2021 and is still raging, with Europe experiencing its worst bird flu outbreak on record. It was first detected in the US in January and has since spread to at least 32 states, resulting in the death of more than 36 million chickens and turkeys and triggering a spike in egg prices.
While the virus has a near 100 percent mortality rate among infected poultry &mdash; and can spread rapidly among birds, especially in packed industrial farming conditions &mdash; it&rsquo;s currently believed to pose little threat to human beings. It only rarely spills over to people, and only to those who come into close contact with infected birds. Even when there are human infections, &ldquo;the viruses are unable to efficiently transmit between humans,&rdquo; notes Michelle Wille, a virus ecologist at the University of Sydney.&nbsp;
But when certain strains of avian flu do manage to infect humans, it can be deadly. From 2003 to 2021, a little more than half of the 863 people who contracted an earlier strain of H5N1 died. The H5N1 strain currently spreading appears to be less transmissible and less severe to humans than those that infected people in the past, and only two people have tested positive for the strain &mdash; a man in the United Kingdom last December, and a man in Colorado last week.
The Colorado man &mdash; a prison inmate who had come in direct contact with presumably infected birds while working at a culling operation as part of a pre-release work program &mdash; experienced a few days of fatigue and recovered after being treated with an antiviral drug. Around 10 people who came into contact with him are under close observation.&nbsp;
Beyond the occasional one-off case in close human contacts, the bigger worry is that an unchecked flu that spreads among birds has plenty of opportunities to mutate in a way that allows it to transmit efficiently from person to person, thereby kicking off a new influenza pandemic. A widespread bird flu outbreak in 2005 raised alarm bells and prompted the US Senate to allocate $4 billion to prepare for a possible influenza pandemic &mdash; though when a new flu pandemic did break out in 2009, the origin was ultimately found in a swine virus.
So far, the bird flu has mostly been a problem for birds. It&rsquo;s not the disease that&rsquo;s killing most of them, however &mdash; it&rsquo;s their owners.&nbsp;
When chicken, turkey, and egg companies detect one infected bird, they kill the whole flock in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. And they&rsquo;re doing so using a variety of excruciating methods, including spraying birds with a suffocating water-based foam or closing off barn vents to raise temperatures so the birds die by heat stroke, a practice called ventilation shutdown, which can take 1.5 to 3.75 hours to kill them.
[Image: https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23438209/2LDKg_the_bird_flu_has_resulted_in_the_death_of_more_than_36_million_chickens_and_turkeys_since_february__2_.png?quality=90&strip=all]
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrendous,&rdquo; says Craig Watts, a former large-scale chicken farmer and currently a director of field operations for the Socially Responsible Agriculture Project, a nonprofit that advocates against industrial livestock operations. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in those houses when the power went out and the generator didn&rsquo;t kick on. In just a few minutes [the heat] is unbearable. &hellip; I can&rsquo;t imagine that going on for hours and hours.&rdquo;
According to the Storm Lake Times, a newspaper based near Rembrandt&rsquo;s operation, the company used ventilation shutdown plus, or VSD+, meaning they also pumped heat into their barns to kill the birds faster, a practice being employed in several states. Rembrandt Enterprises did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;
The situation is horrific, but given the industrialized nature of the US poultry industry and its response to past bird flu outbreaks, animal advocates say it&rsquo;s unsurprising. Nearly all birds raised for meat and eggs in the US are raised on factory farms, where producers raise hundreds of thousands to millions of animals per year. And most of these animals are genetically identical, which could make them more vulnerable to bird flu. Some experts say the intensification of animal farming &mdash; raising more animals closer together &mdash; could also be increasing the virulence and transmission rate of bird flu strains.
Dena Jones of the Animal Welfare Institute says the 2014-2015 bird flu outbreak in the US, which led to the culling of more than 50 million animals &mdash; the largest cull in US history &mdash; didn&rsquo;t prompt any real change in the industry. Instead, mega operations that raise millions of birds per year are continuing to be built across the country, from Oregon to Wisconsin and West Virginia to North Carolina as US chicken and egg consumption rises.

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re doubling down on this same system by raising more animals with less genetic diversity and higher density in larger operations, and all of that contributes to making it difficult to humanely kill an animal during an emergency,&rdquo; Jones said.
There are culling methods that kill the birds much quicker than ventilation shutdown, such as spraying them with nitrogen-filled foam or gassing them in small enclosures, a method some producers are using to address this outbreak. There&rsquo;s also a race to create an effective bird flu vaccine that could be used to slow the spread of future outbreaks, a race the USDA is partially funding.&nbsp;
Considering the speed at which bird flu spreads among commercial poultry flocks, and how painful it is for infected birds, the industry has no choice but to mass cull. But the USDA&rsquo;s approval of ventilation shutdown in 2015 and the rise of its use in recent years, combined with the slow pace of vaccine approval and adoption, mean that for the time being, the birds themselves will continue to receive little consideration in the fight against bird flu. The ongoing expansion and intensification of US animal agriculture, along with a rise in animal disease outbreaks, might also mean that we need to learn how to live with the bird flu and the looming threat it poses.
Bird flu spread, explained
Migratory waterfowl, like ducks, geese, and terns, are the natural hosts of highly pathogenic avian influenza strains, but can largely &mdash; though not always &mdash; carry and spread the virus without showing symptoms.
Wild birds rarely come into direct contact with farmed chickens and turkeys, most of which are raised in large indoor barns &mdash; especially in more developed economies &mdash; but instead spread the virus when their fecal droppings, saliva, or nasal secretions contaminate animal feed or land on surfaces like farmworkers&rsquo; clothing or farm equipment. Researchers say the global poultry trade also contributes to the worldwide spread of the bird flu through the import and export of infected poultry.
Once any birds test positive for the virus, the whole flock is culled, as the flu can quickly spread to the tens of thousands of other hens, chickens, or turkeys in a single farm. And the flu itself is agonizing for infected poultry. Chickens have trouble breathing and suffer from extreme diarrhea, and sometimes develop swelling around their head, neck, or eyes. Turkeys&rsquo; wings can become paralyzed and they might experience tremors.&nbsp;
[Image: A turkey farm in Illinois in 2019. Over the last few months, millions of chickens and turkeys have been culled — primarily at large-scale farms — to slow the spread of the bird flu. https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23433878/GettyImages_1182547600.jpg?quality=90&strip=all]
Bird flu outbreaks have been recorded in commercial poultry flocks since at least the 19th century, but the frequency accelerated &mdash; and became a bigger issue in the poultry industry &mdash; starting in 1997, when an outbreak of H5N1 in Hong Kong chicken farms led to 18 infections in people, six of whom died. Officials responded by culling all 1.3 million chickens in Hong Kong in the winter of 1997-98. Since then, outbreaks have occurred around the world every few years.
And not much beyond mass culling can be done to slow the spread once it starts. Adel Talaat, a professor of microbiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says we should improve disease surveillance and farm biosecurity to help prevent new outbreaks and slow the spread, but a vaccine that could reliably reduce transmission would go a long way.&nbsp;
At the moment, there aren&rsquo;t any highly effective vaccines on the market, but Talaat is working to develop one using a database of thousands of avian influenza antigens to create a &ldquo;composite&rdquo; vaccine that he hopes will protect against current and future virus strains. &ldquo;Our job is to try to stop this cycle of transmission,&rdquo; Talaat says. &ldquo;Because if you stop the cycle of transmission you will be able to basically stop the mutation and stop the replication of the virus.&rdquo;
[Image: Adel Talaat, a professor of microbiology at University of Wisconsin-Madison, is developing a bird flu vaccine he hopes can be used to slow the spread of future bird flu outbreaks. https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23433865/Talaat_Adel_lab20_3849.jpg?quality=90&strip=all]
He estimates it could take up to five years until he completes his work and hopefully receives USDA approval, and says a mass vaccination program in the early phase of a bird flu outbreak could be effective at slowing the spread of the virus.
&ldquo;In a big country [like the US], once we start seeing any one case, we know it&rsquo;s going to go throughout the states &mdash; state by state &mdash; so we really should start an aggressive campaign for vaccination right away,&rdquo; Talaat says.
Aside from the ineffectiveness of currently available bird flu vaccines, they&rsquo;re also made in such a way that it&rsquo;s impossible to distinguish vaccinated, non-infected birds from infected birds. And because no country wants to import meat from potentially infected birds, the vaccines have been a non-starter. Talaat hopes his vaccine will solve this long-standing problem.&nbsp;
A spokesperson with the National Turkey Federation told Vox over email that the trade group &ldquo;supports vaccine development and believes it can be done relatively quickly. However, World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) rules impose severe trade penalties for vaccine use, and we are encouraging USDA to work aggressively for a change in those rules.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Decisions on vaccinations require many data and we&rsquo;re investigating an avian influenza vaccine that could distinguish from the wild-type virus,&rdquo; Rick Coker, a USDA spokesperson, said over email.&nbsp;&ldquo;We do not have a time frame on any potential vaccine or how it would be used.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There are also efforts underway to create a gene-edited chicken breed immune to bird flu. But for now, the primary way to prevent the flu from killing poultry is by killing poultry.&nbsp;
Toward less cruel culling methods
During the 2014-2015 bird flu outbreak, the most common culling method in the US&nbsp;entailed spraying turkeys with suffocating water-based foam; with this method, it takes seven to 15 minutes for the birds to die, and it causes significant pain. The second-most common method was gassing hens with carbon dioxide in small enclosures, which can render birds unconscious within 30 seconds.&nbsp;
But according to the USDA, deploying these methods was sometimes too slow to meet the need of depopulating infected flocks within 24 hours. So, at the end of 2015, fearing another wave of outbreaks, the USDA approved ventilation shutdown &mdash; closing off air vents so the temperature rises, which can take hours for the birds to die by heat stroke. The USDA now says ventilation shutdown alone, without added heat or CO2, should only be used as a last-resort measure.
Over email, Coker with the USDA told Vox that ventilation shutdown plus should only be used under &ldquo;constrained circumstances,&rdquo; like when depopulation by water-based foam or CO2 gassing is not possible. Various factors, like epidemiological information and housing and environmental conditions are weighed by USDA personnel, farm operators, and state officials when deciding whether or not to use VSD+. &ldquo;Should VSD+ be authorized on-site, responders will carry it out quickly and as humanely as possible,&rdquo; he said.
Despite the policy to only use it under constrained circumstances, VSD+ has already been employed in at least six states and on millions of birds during this current outbreak.&nbsp;
Will Lowrey, an attorney with the animal rights group Animal Outlook who has submitted public records requests on VSD+, found that in addition to being used on the 5.3 million Rembrandt hens, it has also been used on commercial poultry farms in Kentucky, Delaware, Minnesota (Jennie-O/Hormel), Missouri (Tyson Foods), and Wisconsin.
Producers do have some incentive to use VSD+ over other culling options. To receive reimbursement for costs incurred during depopulation and disposal, they have to use a culling method permitted by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), a nongovernmental trade group, and VSD+ generally requires less labor and supplies than most other methods. But it&rsquo;s an inhumane practice.
In the AVMA&rsquo;s culling guidelines for VSD+, the organization cites research conducted at North Carolina State University in 2016 meant to replicate and study ventilation shutdown. Researchers placed one chicken at a time in a small enclosure and pumped in heat, carbon dioxide, or both. Animal Outlook obtained footage from that experiment via a Freedom of Information Act request and shared it with Marina Bolotnikova for the Intercept. You can view the experiment below (warning: it&rsquo;s graphic).
[Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ5drCCgrng]
In the video, a bird appears to be gasping for air, unable to stand, and according to a veterinarian interviewed by the Intercept, showing signs of attempting to vocalize (the video has no audio). It took around 91 minutes for the birds to die of just ventilation shutdown, 53 minutes when heat was added, 11.5 minutes when carbon dioxide was added, and nine minutes when both heat and carbon dioxide were added. Other research has found that times are much longer for hens in stacked cage systems, as opposed to turkeys and chickens raised for meat who live on barn floors.
A coalition of more than 1,500 veterinarians, appropriately called Veterinarians Against Ventilation Shutdown, say the process is inhumane and are calling on the American Veterinary Medical Association to classify it as &ldquo;not recommended&rdquo; for culling. An investigator with Direct Action Everywhere &mdash; the group that&rsquo;s been disrupting Minnesota Timberwolves games &mdash; says they entered a Rembrandt facility after depopulation and allegedly found some birds who had survived ventilation shutdown plus.
&ldquo;On the floor and in the cages we found &hellip; upwards of 100 chickens [still alive],&rdquo; the investigator, who spoke with me on the condition of anonymity, said. &ldquo;If you [extrapolate that for] the parts of the facility we didn&rsquo;t go into, maybe several hundred chickens were still stuck in cages or running around loose.&rdquo;

Jones says more humane methods need to be prioritized, like nitrogen-filled foam and small-enclosure gassing, which knock animals unconscious before they die.&nbsp;
Despite the challenges that come with these methods &mdash; increased costs and labor, among others &mdash; Watts, the ex-chicken farmer, says change would be a matter of the industry prioritizing animal welfare.
&ldquo;I hear the industry argument about everything costing too much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re serious about animal welfare, you and I [wouldn&rsquo;t be] having this discussion on what could be done better &mdash; they would already be doing it.&rdquo; He wants to see the industrialized model that dominates US agriculture today &mdash; the model he once raised birds in &mdash; replaced by farms with smaller flock sizes, and where birds are given outdoor access and more space.&nbsp;
Factory-farming animals is an inherently risky business. And when a system that crams tens of thousands of birds together is faced with a highly-transmissible, lethal virus, that system is largely defenseless. At best, industry can work to minimize harm, but only if it&rsquo;s willing to pay increased costs. But the conditions on today&rsquo;s meat and egg farms &mdash; and the approval and adoption of ventilation shutdown &mdash; demonstrate a drive toward efficiency, not welfare.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the short term, it would be my preference to see something more painless and quick&rdquo; used to cull the birds, says Watts. &ldquo;In the long term, what we&rsquo;re looking at is a very flawed system &mdash; it&rsquo;s time to just basically push it off a ledge and reboot and start over.&rdquo;",Vox,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that a little more than half of the 863 people who contracted an earlier strain of H5N1 died.

A new strain of avian flu is decimating wild birds. Humans should worry,1660780800000,"In a pre-Covid 19 world, the deaths of 86mn birds would have been a global news story

The sound of a seabird colony is overwhelming. The air is thick with kittiwakes, ​​uillemots, razorbills and shags. Shrieks and calls ricochet down the cliffs and the rhythmic flap-flap of wings cuts the air like ­tadium applause. Birds ride the wind in spirals, dive to the waves, burrow into shelves in the cliff face or settle on rocky promontories.

The summer breeding season is coming to an end for many of the species at St Abb’ Head nature reserve in Scotland’ East Lothian, 50 miles east of Edinburgh. Adult guillemots and their chicks have already migrated to their wintering grounds. I’ sitting on a grassy verge at the cliff’ edge, overlooking the rocky bay that houses the colony, with Ciaran Hatsell, a National Trust of Scotland ranger. “ get empty nest syndrome at the end of the season,”atsell says, half smiling. “t’ like 60,000 of your kids leaving all at once.”

Hatsell knows about loss. On June 5, he discovered the first signs of avian influenza in one of the gannets. Since then it has wiped out thousands of birds on the reserve. The flu is a highly pathogenic strain of the H5N1 virus. Since its early detections in poultry and wild birds in the spring of 2021, this new strain has killed more than 86 million birds in the US and Europe alone, predominantly through poultry culling, the mass slaughter of birds at sites where cases have been found. The European Food Safety Authority said the 2021-2022 ­pidemic season was the largest ever recorded on the continent.

Hundreds of thousands of wild birds have been affected too, particularly seabirds that live in densely packed colonies —ptimal conditions for the spread of disease. The level of transmission in wild bird species is unprecedented. Whereas previous strains have affected a handful of species before petering out by the end of the winter, the current one has infected hundreds of species and hung around in populations year-round.

In Rajasthan, India, locals looked on in alarm in November last year as Demoiselles cranes, elegant grey-blue birds with long black necks, began showing signs of lethargy and confusion. Three hundred of the three-foot-tall birds, which feature prominently in Indian poetry and mythology, are said to have died. The virus spread west, wiping out 8,000 common cranes in Israel, “he worst blow to wildlife in the country’ history” according to the environment minister. At Greece’ Lake Mikri Prespa, home to the world’ largest Dalmatian pelican colony, more than half of the enormous, prehistoric-looking birds perished. An annual census of the species across the Balkans in May revealed a 40 per cent decline in the population compared to last year.

In Scotland, among the worst-hit countries because of the concentration of seabirds on its coasts, the virus has wiped out more than half of the great skua colonies in Orkney and St Kilda. Scotland is home to about 60 per cent of the world’ great skuas, a predatory bird known as the pirate of the seas. Conservationists warn that the scale of mortality could push the species into local extinction.

In a pre-Covid-19 world, all this might have been a major global news story. But with the pandemic, Russia’ invasion of Ukraine, a looming recession and another infectious disease that presents a greater risk to humans —onkeypox —ominating headlines, avian flu has barely made the agenda.

“’e worked in conservation for 30 years and I’e never seen anything like this,”ays Susan Davies, chief executive of the Scottish Seabird Centre in North Berwick. The centre has for years organised trips to the Bass Rock, home to the world’ largest gannet colony, now site of one of the most significant H5N1 outbreaks. Drone images comparing the Bass Rock this June with September 2020 reveal the extent of the devastation. The rock, usually gleaming white with gannets, is muddy brown, with large empty patches.

At St Abb’, the virus spread through the colony at relentless speed. Of the 109 gannet nests Hatsell counted this breeding season, only one chick has survived. “his is a population level event, and it’ happening in our lifetimes,”e says as we walk along the cliff. “pecies that we’e been working [to conserve] are potentially going to be wiped out.”

It’ not just gannets. From where Hatsell and I are perched, we can see a group of dead kittiwakes lying on an outcrop below the lighthouse, near a roosting spot that Hatsell believes was a key point of transmission. The area around the bodies is empty, as though the other birds know to stay away.

Rangers like Hatsell have been the first and, often, the only responders in this outbreak. He and his colleagues at ecological sites around the UK, including his partner, who works on the Farne Islands off the coast of Northumberland, just over the border, have been donning PPE and clearing the infected carcasses in an attempt to contain the spread. “he jobs that they loved    ave turned into a dystopian dream,”atsell says of his colleagues. “hey are in full hazmat suits and respirator masks, putting birds in bin bags. It’ like something out of a film.”

There have only been two recorded cases of the new H5N1 strain in humans, but 456 people have died since 2003 after catching previous strains of the virus, according to the World Health Organization. Emerging infectious diseases are a growing threat to both humans and animals, as virologists have warned for decades, to little effect until Covid struck. The WHO reports that 75 per cent of new infectious diseases detected in the past three decades originated in animals. With mass urbanisation, industrial farming and the destruction of natural habitats, we are living in closer proximity to livestock, increasing the risk of mutations and spillover into other species. Meanwhile, a study published in Nature this month found that over half of the known human pathogenic diseases have been aggravated by climate change.

Hatsell hands me his binoculars so I can scan the cliff face for chicks. He explains how guillemots begin their migration before they have even learnt to fly. With their parents’ncouragement, they leave the nest for the first and last time with a leap from the high ledges down into the water, some as young as 15 days old. Many chicks don’ make it, dashed against the rocks. Nature is cruel, but the scale of the mortality rates among wild birds here and around the world seems far from natural.

Outbreaks of disease in domestic birds have been recorded since the late 1800s, with the term “owl plague”n use until the mid-20th century, and local cullings taking place from time to time. But the H5N1 virus was a game-changer, becoming the first avian flu to cross the species barrier to humans. First detected in a farmed goose in southern China in 1996, the virus was then discovered in poultry facilities across China and Hong Kong. In 1997, 18 people in Hong Kong were found to be infected and one-third of them died. In a desperate move to contain the outbreak, the Hong Kong government killed all poultry in the territory within three days. This was later hailed as helping avert a possible pandemic.

The virus re-emerged in Asia in 2003, and from 2005 was spread by wild birds to poultry in Africa, the Middle East and Europe, including Britain, causing periodic outbreaks. From there it has moved back and forth between domestic and wild birds, evolving as it goes.

Seabirds are long-lived and loyal creatures. Some live up to 50 years and don’ start breeding until the age of five or six, meaning their birth rates are relatively low. Provided they breed successfully, most remain with their partner for life. “hey have the kind of biology that doesn’ cope well with extraordinary additional mortality,”ays Ruth Cromie, scientific lead of the UN-led Task Force on Avian Influenza and Wild Birds. It can take decades to build up a population after mass deaths.

The task force, convened by FAO, the UN’ food and agriculture agency, and CMS, its secretariat on migratory species, was launched in 2005, in large part to prevent counterproductive responses like attempts to kill wild birds, as well as misinformation about the role of wild birds in spreading the virus. Ducks and geese were increasingly being demonised in the media. In October 2005, The Sun newspaper ran the headline “ucks of death”cross a photomontage of a flock flying over London. The coverage made Cromie and her colleagues fear for wild bird conservation efforts almost more than the virus itself. “t’ like what Jaws did for shark conservation,”he says.

Marco Barbieri, scientific adviser at CMS, notes that the initial H5N1 outbreak gained global attention because it could infect humans. The current mutation of the virus does not have the same “oonotic potential”e says, meaning the ability to jump from animals to humans. While there have been two cases in humans, that is low for an outbreak of this magnitude. This might explain the slower response by governments to the outbreaks in wild bird colonies. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has criticised the government for being “sleep at the wheel”uring the recent emergency. It called for an immediate response plan in England, where tern colonies in Northumberland have been ravaged, and a plan for further possible outbreaks this winter.

A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the FT it was developing an English seabird conservation strategy to be published in spring 2023, to assess the vulnerability of each species and propose actions to address them. But Cromie says that most government agencies have given little focus to wild birds in their response planning. “here’ always the sense that it’ wildlife, so we can’ do anything.”

It’ true that there is little that can be done to slow outbreaks in wild animals once they are infected. “lu is endemic in wild birds, and we can’ vaccinate them or track them with any great detail,”ays Paul Digard, chair of virology at the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh University’ animal science research centre. What can be done, however, is to improve biosecurity in commercial facilities to prevent the virus leaking in or out, and to limit human access to wild bird colonies that have been impacted by the virus, in case we unwittingly spread it to new environments. Governments, meanwhile, could ensure they are better prepared for future outbreaks by installing monitoring and reporting systems to understand the transmission of the virus in wild birds.

Many scientists believe that industrial poultry farming is the cause of the current, highly pathogenic strain. However, because of the difficulty of tracing the spread of the virus in wild birds, this is hard to prove. Digard says that while previous strains originated in chicken farms and can spread to wild species, there is as yet no evidence that this is the cause of the latest outbreak.

Barbieri and Cromie say one way to mitigate the long-term population losses of avian flu is by reducing the environmental pressures seabirds are already under and maintaining populations through conservation. “e need to recognise that all our healths are interconnected,”ays Cromie. “t’ not as if nature is something over there.”

“o you know how many gannets Ciaran has left?”sks Maggie Sheddan, as we speed out of the fishing port of Dunbar on a boat towards the Bass Rock. We skirt along the low, rugged coastline, past Tyninghame beach and the forests devastated by Storm Arwen last year. I tell her what Hatsell told me the day before: just the one chick. “ell, that’ something.”heddan squints, her pale blue eyes fixed on the horizon.

I follow her gaze. The sun has just hit the rock, which rises 350ft out of the sea, its steep cliffs shining. The wind has agitated the birds into orbit. They float in a halo of gold high above the island. Sheddan is smiling wide at the sight, gesturing with her hands as we draw in closer, and the magnitude of the colony becomes apparent. She has been leading landing tours on the island for 20 years. “ou’ be forgiven for thinking there was nothing wrong here,”he says, laughing up at the sky, which teems with life.

The boat draws nearer and I get a better look at the gannets. With a wingspan of two metres, they are the largest seabirds in the Northern Atlantic. Their plumage is white with black-tipped wings, yellow heads and piercing blue eyes.

During a normal breeding season the rock is blanketed in birds, almost every inch of its surface occupied. But now the population looks drastically thinner, even from a distance, and large areas of rock are empty, with birds lying dead on the lower promontories. We see a chick, recognisable from its fluffier plumage, lifeless in the water.

When a visitor first spotted dead birds on the cameras at the North Berwick Seabird Centre at the start of June, Sheddan headed straight out to investigate. After her boat landed at the rock, she walked up the path and through the gate, as she has countless times, and was immediately met by a couple of gannets dying at the gateway. By the time she reached the main colony, she realised the extent of the devastation. “ was out late in May and it was absolutely fine,”he says, shaking her head. “he speed and ferocity of this when it hit was just unprecedented. It was just wiping them out.”

The symptoms are distressing to see. Lethargy, confusion, birds unable to lift their head and wings, shaking and nodding their head and, when in water, swimming in circles. Sheddan shows me a video of a bird in the final throes of the disease, convulsing and fitting. She says it takes between 24 to 72 hours for the bird to die once infected. “his ­itting is horrendous to watch because this is a strong bird who has amazing control    ”he trails off. “nd how long it takes    ou just want death to come for them.”

We pull closer and watch the birds dive down to the cliff at intervals to reunite with their partners. They greet one another by bill fencing: stretching their necks high and tapping their bills back and forth, like a high-frequency double-cheek kiss. Sheddan says it strengthens the bond between partners. Each time she spots a pair reuniting she laughs with joy, pointing out that a pair means a new nest. “hat’ life, that’ hope for the future.”

“ can’ imagine going out to Bass Rock right now. It had to have been heartbreaking,”ays Bryan Richards, emerging disease co-ordinator at the US Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Center. He talks to me via video link from his office in Wisconsin. A model duck and an impressive-looking pair of binoculars sit on a cabinet behind him.

“ver the last couple of years, the impacts on wild birds in Europe and Asia have been escalating, both geographically in the number of species, and the scale of individual morbidity and mortality,”e tells me. During the last outbreak of high pathogenic avian flu in North America that began in 2014, approximately 100 infections were documented in 20 species of wild bird. During the 2021-22 outbreak, 96 species, and approximately 2,500 wild birds have been confirmed to have contracted it in the US and Canada. “bviously those are a small proportion of true mortality,”e says.

As with everyone with whom I have discussed the virus, one of Richards’hief concerns is the scale of mortality and the longer-term effect on bird populations. He tells me about a few island colonies on Lake Michigan that are home to Caspian terns. On Gravel Island National Wildlife Refuge, there were 391 active Caspian tern nests in early June this year. Two weeks later, only one active nest remained.

Virologists spend a lot of time trying to predict which zoonotic disease will become the next pandemic in humans, but there seems to be far less concern about the spread across wild species. The new strain of H5N1 has not only affected wild birds. In the spring, Richard’ colleagues began to detect cases in scavenging mammals. It has since been confirmed in striped skunks, virginia possums, raccoons, bobcat, mink, coyote and, in Maine, seals. “his is a function of our changing globe,”ichards says. “e continue to put stresses on remaining habitats, remaining wildlife species and we crowd in all our pathogens together in the same time and space, more frequently than we ever have before.”

Human activity poses all kinds of threats to seabirds, as it does to many species. A 2018 study by the University of Aberdeen showed the global population of seabirds had declined 70 per cent since the 1950s as a result of environmental pressures like industrial fishing, pollution, predation by invasive species and climate change. As the sea has warmed and industrial fishing has proliferated, stocks of seabird prey such as sand eels have dropped dramatically, leaving the birds with less food. Seabirds routinely die caught in fishing nets or from ingesting plastic, while heatwaves and extreme weather events mean they are producing fewer chicks.

At the Seabird Centre in North Berwick, a low stone building with a copper roof curved like the tail of a bird, Maggie Sheddan shows me the screens carrying live footage of the gannets from cameras placed on the Bass Rock. I watch a gannet who appears to be showing symptoms of avian flu. The bird seems confused, but is not yet showing signs of lethargy and fitting that occur in the later stages of infection. Just behind it lies a dead bird.

Spain detects two bird flu infections in poultry farm workers,1667433600000,"MADRID (Reuters) - Two Spanish poultry farm workers tested positive for bird flu following an outbreak in poultry, in what appears to be the first known human infections in Spain and the second in Europe since 2003, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. The poultry outbreak was confirmed by authorities on Sept. 20 and there has been no evidence to date of human-to-human transmission related to this event, the WHO said. The infections with influenza A (H5N1) of the two workers - males aged 19 and 27 - were detected in September and October, likely triggered by exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments at the farm in Guadalajara in central Spain. Both men did not have any symptoms and were isolated until they tested negative. Following the poultry outbreak, all farm workers and their close contacts were tested. Spain's Health Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Can you get bird flu?,1675209600000,"Maybe you&rsquo;ve noticed: Eggs are really expensive.
By late last year, the average cost of a dozen Grade A large eggs had more than doubled since January. They&rsquo;ve been so pricey &mdash;&nbsp;more than $10 at certain retailers &mdash; that some people are now smuggling them into the US from Mexico.
One major culprit? The spread of avian influenza, a.k.a. bird flu.
The viral disease has wiped out tens of millions of wild and farmed birds in the US, including egg-laying hens, many of which were not infected but were culled to stop the flu from spreading. The ongoing surge is now considered the largest avian influenza outbreak in US history.

There&rsquo;s some comfort in the name, avian influenza. The virus that&rsquo;s been tearing through poultry farms, known as H5N1, typically targets birds, not humans.
But a recent outbreak of H5N1 at a mink fur farm in Spain has some scientists worried. Farms with dense populations of minks &mdash;&nbsp;which are mammals, like us &mdash;&nbsp;are ideal places for this virus to acquire new mutations or other genetic changes that could help it spread more easily between humans. And testing at the fur farm revealed the virus had already acquired at least one such mutation.
Meanwhile, wildlife monitoring has shown some other mammals have recently contracted bird flu, including a few grizzly bears in Montana, skunks, and otters.
This makes us wonder: Is bird flu creeping closer to humans?
The short answer: no. In its current form, H5N1 doesn&rsquo;t have the machinery to easily infect humans or spread quickly among us. That&rsquo;s the good news. What is concerning is that avian influenza viruses are known to change quickly &mdash;&nbsp;especially when they&rsquo;re abundant and spreading among certain animal populations. Hence why some scientists are worried now.
&ldquo;Avian influenza is near the top of the list in terms of viruses that have pandemic potential,&rdquo; Daniel Olson, an epidemiologist at the University of Colorado, told Vox. &ldquo;Coronaviruses are up there, too, but avian influenza is just as high &mdash;&nbsp;and maybe even higher.&rdquo;
That doesn&rsquo;t mean avian influenza is about to become the next pandemic. Yet experts are on alert, and are looking for any signs that the situation might change. Here&rsquo;s what to know about the current human risk of bird flu.
What it would take for bird flu to become a human pandemic
The H5N1 virus that&rsquo;s spreading now was first detected in the &rsquo;90s, at a goose farm in southern China, making it a relatively new type of avian influenza. (There are other strains of bird flu, but for the purposes of this article, we&rsquo;ll use &ldquo;bird flu&rdquo; to mean H5N1.)
In the decades since, the virus has mostly been a problem for birds, especially domestic poultry. It&rsquo;s highly contagious, and infection can cause severe damage to birds&rsquo; internal organs. Outbreaks of the virus can wipe out 90 percent or more of farm birds within 48 hours.&nbsp;
[Image: Avian influenza infects wild birds like snow geese, pictured here. https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24401676/GettyImages_1246532789.jpg?quality=90&strip=all]
A number of mammals including humans have also become infected over the years. While it can kill us &mdash;&nbsp;H5N1 has a frighteningly high mortality rate &mdash;&nbsp;this virus has yet to become widespread or approach anything close to a pandemic.
For any pathogen to have the potential to cause a human pandemic, it has to have three important qualities, according to several flu experts. It must spread easily among humans, particularly through the air. It must cause human disease. And it must be something that most of our immune systems haven&rsquo;t encountered before &mdash; that is, it must be novel.
Thankfully, H5N1 doesn&rsquo;t meet all of these criteria.
For one, it doesn&rsquo;t have the right machinery to efficiently infect our bodies and isn&rsquo;t easily transmitted between them.
To infiltrate a host, viruses first have to bind to certain receptors on the surface of their cells. The virus that&rsquo;s currently spreading, H5N1, does this using a specific kind of protein known as hemagglutinin 5, or H5. You can think of H5 as a key and receptors as the locks.
Following this metaphor, H5 can unlock certain receptors found in cells that line the respiratory and digestive tracts of birds. By invading those cells and replicating, the virus can damage these vital systems, making it difficult for the birds to breathe and easy for them to spread the virus among themselves (through breath and feces).
Humans have some similar, avian-type receptors in our respiratory systems, too. But for reasons scientists don&rsquo;t fully understand, they don&rsquo;t make us as vulnerable to avian flu as birds are. Critically, we also have a higher number of different, non-avian-type receptor that bird flu viruses don&rsquo;t like to bind to quite as much. The abundance of those non-avian receptors in our noses seems to protect us from being easily infected by viruses like H5N1.
The upshot: H5N1 doesn&rsquo;t easily bind to cells in our airways, so it&rsquo;s harder for the virus to infect us. Humans can still be infected, but likely only if we&rsquo;re exposed to a large amount of virus or the conditions are just right for transmission (though scientists don&rsquo;t know what those conditions are, exactly). Most people who have come down with bird flu spent a more-than-casual amount of time around birds, usually while working with or around sick flocks.
&ldquo;If you look at all the H5 infections over the past two decades or more, the vast majority of those reported exposure to sick or dying poultry prior to the infection,&rdquo; said Richard Webby, a virologist specializing in animal and bird influenza at St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital.
Flu viruses that can&rsquo;t cause infection in humans&rsquo; airways are much harder to transmit among humans &mdash; and therefore, they can&rsquo;t cause a pandemic. Unless something changes.
Bird flu evolves quickly. That’s what makes it a threat.
If there&rsquo;s anything concerning about the current bird flu, it&rsquo;s that it could mutate and evolve. If it&rsquo;s not a threat to humans today, it could become one.
That&rsquo;s because influenza viruses are incredibly changeable. Like other viruses, H5N1 picks up small mutations as it replicates within a host; over time, that can give the virus certain benefits (though mutations are often bad for the virus).
But influenza viruses can also undergo much bigger and more consequential shifts through a process called reassortment.
Reassortment is like something out of science fiction: When two influenza viruses infect the same cell in the same host, they can trade entire chunks of their genomes with each other, yielding a variety of Franken-flus.
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a red flag for researchers when avian flu spreads among animals that can also easily get sick with other kinds of influenza. Pigs, for example, have flu receptors in their respiratory systems that both human and bird viruses easily bind to, so they can get infected with both. Should these two viruses meet inside these animals, they might swap parts, producing an avian flu that can more easily infect mammals.
The same is true for mink: They can be infected by both avian and mammalian influenza. (The famous and particularly devastating 1918 pandemic likely originated in birds and may have passed through a mammal before jumping to humans.)
Experts fear that in &ldquo;mixing vessels&rdquo; like pigs or mink, H5N1 could exchange a segment of its genome that makes it easily transmissible among birds for one that makes it easily transmissible among mammals &mdash; and, eventually, to humans. In theory, that could lead to the creation of a virus with all of H5N1&rsquo;s other bad personality traits &mdash; its ability to cause severe disease, for example &mdash; with the added advantage of, say, being able to easily infiltrate cells in our airways.
(There are some signs that the H5N1 virus that spread through the Spanish mink farm picked up a mutation that&rsquo;s known to help it replicate more easily in mammals. It&rsquo;s not clear, however, if the virus picked up the mutation before or after spreading to minks.)
[Image: A mink at a fur farm in Denmark on November 14, 2020. https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24401686/GettyImages_1229618539.jpg?quality=90&strip=all]
These major genetic shifts are so worrying because they can produce novel viruses that humans have never been exposed to. Although our immune systems likely would be able to recognize and fight off a common strain of flu that&rsquo;s mutated slightly over time, it&rsquo;s much harder to mount a quick response to a brand new strain.
The potential to evolve novelty is what puts bird flu on the pandemic potential radar, according to Seema Lakdawala, a virologist and influenza A transmission specialist at Emory University. &ldquo;Pandemics emerge with shifts,&rdquo; she said.
Rest assured, not all genetic shifts produce a pathogen with pandemic potential, said Lakdawala. Plus, even if H5N1 does evolve a way to more easily invade our airways, that doesn&rsquo;t guarantee it will be able to spread among humans. To be easily transmissible, the virus also needs to replicate efficiently once it&rsquo;s inside the cell, and survive in the air after it&rsquo;s expelled in a cough or a sneeze.
There&rsquo;s little evidence that bird flu has adapted to spread easily between mammals, much less between humans. Emerging evidence suggests that in many H5N1 cases among wild animals &mdash; and in the latest mink farm cases &mdash; infections among multiple animals likely occurred not because of transmission between animals, but because several animals all ate infected birds loaded with virus.
The real public health risk of bird flu
There&rsquo;s more good news: Even if bird flu does evolve tools to infiltrate a human host and spread among us, we have tools of our own to detect and combat the virus.
The US government already has a stockpile of human vaccines for bird flu, including those specifically for H5N1, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There are also vaccines available for farm birds (though they&rsquo;re not widely used, for reasons that Vox&rsquo;s Kenny Torrella explains here).
Meanwhile, oseltamivir, a drug commonly used to treat more common types of flu infections, has been effective at treating human cases of H5 flu. And surveillance of flu in human and animal populations is a global health priority.

Bird flu does, however, pose an immediate threat to humans, not because we&rsquo;re at risk of infection but because it&rsquo;s squeezing the global food supply, according to Carol Cardona, an avian health expert at the University of Minnesota.
Eggs and other poultry products, as well as some wild birds, have long been relatively cheap and vital sources of protein in much of the world. Should avian influenza continue to rip through large farms, or spread to backyard coops, it could extend the cost-of-living crisis.
&ldquo;The risk to humans is through food and food supply,&rdquo; Cardona said. &ldquo;And the people who are being cut off from food supply are at the lowest economic level.&rdquo;
The US Department of Agriculture and the CDC monitor flu viruses found in both people and animals for signs of a novel virus with the potential to cause human disease &mdash; a critical component of pandemic preparedness, said Tim Uyeki, a medical epidemiologist and bird flu expert at the CDC. Although the disruptive virus freshest in our minds might be a coronavirus, most human respiratory pandemics in recent memory &mdash; those of 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 &mdash; have been caused by novel influenza A viruses.
&ldquo;Constant vigilance and surveillance is needed worldwide to monitor the potential threat of these and other viruses as they evolve,&rdquo; Uyeki said.
Changes to the environment like deforestation and a warming climate are also leading to more intermingling of different species and the infectious organisms that call them home &mdash; including flu. &ldquo;We have humans and animals living closer together on a larger scale than we have in the past,&rdquo; Olson said.
That intermingling could at some point create a flu with human pandemic potential, said Lakdawala. &ldquo;The more attempts these viruses make right at jumping across these hurdles, the more likely they are that some of them may be successful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nature is so good at doing this.&rdquo;
Or as Cardona put it: &ldquo;Never bet against a flu virus.&rdquo;",Vox,yes,no,The article mentions that H5N1 has a frighteningly high mortality rate for humans but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.,"Avian influenza is near the top of the list in terms of viruses that have pandemic potential.

"As bird flu spreads to minks, sea lions and other mammals, scientists are on alert for dangerous mutations",1676073600000,"Hundreds of wild sea lions in South America, a farm of minks in Europe, and more than 58 million poultry birds have died. All of these animals fell victim to the impact of avian influenza — a virus rapidly circulating the globe, killing wild and domesticated animals, disrupting ecologies and hampering the food supply.  Human health is inextricably linked to animal health, and these events are spooky reminders that a widespread outbreak in animals has potential consequences for humans.  In the U.S., the most recent wave of bird flu has struck in 17 mammals and more than 160 birds. It’s the broadest outbreak of H5N1 since it surfaced as a concern in China in 1996.  The virus has been under close watch by scientists, even more so now that it has spread far and wide. “This is the number one potential pandemic virus everyone has been interested in for a long time,” said Richard Webby, an infectious disease researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and the director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director-general, said on Wednesday that avian influenza’s spillover to mammal species must be monitored closely, and that risk to humans remained low for the moment. “But we cannot assume that will remain the case, and we must prepare for any change in the status quo,” he said.  The sheer amount of H5N1 circulating has heightened the risk the virus could spill over into other species, develop the ability to transmit among people and become a pandemic. But the virus has yet to unlock a complicated string of mutations or genetic changes that would allow it to spread more rapidly in people. “It’s a series of events, each of which is fairly improbable. This is why I say the risk to humans is presently low. The evolutionary barriers are high,” said Anice Lowen, a virologist and associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine. “It is a numbers game. So that’s one reason why the scale of the current avian outbreak is concerning.” Researchers are particularly concerned about this version of avian influenza, H5N1, because most humans haven’t dealt with it before.  “We don’t have an immune response against H5. That’s why the virus has pandemic potential,” Lowen said. Scientists have also observed high death rates and severe disease in chickens and mammals that have contracted H5N1, which has made them concerned the virus could cause severe sickness in people, too.  The U.S. has counted a single human case of H5N1 in the United States — a prison inmate in Colorado culling infected birds on a farm. Previous spillovers to humans, mostly in people in Southeast Asia and North Africa who likely handled infected birds directly, had high death rates, though those numbers could be biased by limited reporting of mild cases.  H5N1 has long been a top pandemic concern. The version that’s been circulating in ducks and other wild birds has evolved and adapted for efficient spread. As those animals travel, the virus does too, through droppings, saliva and nasal secretions.  Wild birds are shedding virus and infecting animals “over a larger amount and a larger geographic footprint than ever before,” said Bryan Richards, the emerging disease coordinator at the United States Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Center. More than 6,100 wild birds have tested positive for the virus in the U.S. Poultry farm birds likely become infected from contact with wild bird feces or other secretions.  Scavengers like bears, raccoons and foxes have also been infected, likely after eating a dead or diseased bird, Richards said. Marine mammals — including dolphins — have tested positive, too.  Recently, more than 500 sea lions were found dead with H5N1 in Peru. It’s not clear if the virus was spreading among these species or if animals were infected through food.  The virus is poorly adapted for spread in people.  “The avian virus is not as good at attaching to human cells as they are in the birds airways. They’re just not adapted to humans,” said Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease physician and influenza expert at UW Medicine in Seattle.  To spread effectively in humans, the virus would need to make several genetic changes. That process would likely take place in other mammals.   Webby and Lowen said there were two main processes the virus could undertake to evolve a better bind with receptors in human respiratory cells. The first would be for the virus to change rapidly through reassortment, an “evolutionary shortcut” in which an animal becomes infected with both an avian influenza virus and a human virus, Lowen said. During the coinfection, the two segmented influenza viruses could exchange bits of genetic code and combine to create a chimeric virus. That virus would then likely need more replication to fix mismatched genes and develop traits that would allow it to flourish in humans.  “Reassortments would be very concerning to see, but probably they still wouldn’t be able to transmit in humans,” Lowen said. “Likely what would be needed is more evolution to fix the mismatches.” Previous avian influenza pandemics — which began in 1957 and 1968 — required both reassortment and additional mutations before they were able to spread widely among humans, Webby said. Each of these pandemics killed about 1 million people worldwide and about 100,000 people in the U.S.  The second option is for the virus to mutate within a dense group of animals. Researchers grew concerned after an apparent outbreak of H5N1 on a mink farm in Spain.  “They’re in small cages very close together. There’s a level of efficiency of transmission,” Chu said of the mink.  Studies more than a decade ago showed that ferrets could pick up mutations for airborne transmission of H5N1 after serial infections.  In the recent mink farm outbreak, the virus likely spread from mink to mink, Webby said. Although it picked up one mutation of concern, it largely remained adapted for birds. The mink were culled. “Luckily it was stamped out,” Webby said.  The virus faces steep genetic hurdles, but the more it spreads in animals, the more chances it has to surmount those barriers.  Lowen said governments should invest further in surveillance of potential hosts that could help the virus leap to humans, consider measures like vaccination to limit the spread in poultry and invest in science that will help determine what genetic changes could be worrisome for people.",NBCNews,yes,yes,"The article mentions high death rates in previous human cases of H5N1, but notes that these numbers could be biased by limited reporting of mild cases, indicating a potential ascertainment bias.",This is the number one potential pandemic virus everyone has been interested in for a long time.,Richard Webby,0.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0,7,2,8,5,3,4,6,8,2,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,yes,9.2,10.25,0.0463669725,0.0894495413,0.0802293578,0.2050183486,0.0539724771,0.4718990826,0.3290550459,0.1402844037,0.0485963303,0.1370366972,0.0,0.203,0.0,0.467,0.0,0.467,0.401,0.0,0.198,0.0,0.0,0.2305,0.0195,0.166,0.0,0.4015,0.2305,0.216,0.0,0.0,,"But we cannot assume that will remain the case, and we must prepare for any change in the status quo.",Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,"It’s a series of events, each of which is fairly improbable.

Explainer- Bird flu : what are the risks to people and animals?,1676419200000,"Countries ranging from the United States and Britain to France and Japan have suffered record losses of poultry in outbreaks of avian flu in the past year. The disease, which experts said is being spread by migratory birds, reached South American nations such as Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia for the first time. SHOULD HUMANS WORRY ABOUT INFECTIONS? The risk to humans is low, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization. As a precaution, people are advised not to touch dead or sick wild animals. Globally, 868 human infections with H5N1 avian flu - the type of virus circulating around the globe - were reported from 21 countries from January 2003 to Nov. 25, 2022, according to the WHO. Of these cases, 457 were fatal, about 53%. In January, the WHO reported the first known human case of the avian flu H5 virus in Latin America and the Caribbean - an infection in a nine-year-old girl in rural Ecuador. The girl, who was in contact with backyard poultry, was hospitalized, the agency said on Jan. 18. Human cases are usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments, the WHO said. WHICH COUNTRIES HAVE BIRD FLU? At least 60 countries have killed poultry in response to bird flu outbreaks since October 2021, according to data the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health provided to Reuters. Among the countries affected are India, Taiwan, Nepal, Peru, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Niger, the intergovernmental group has said. WHAT BIRDS CAN BE INFECTED? Wild birds including waterfowl like ducks can carry bird flu viruses without appearing sick and easily spread them to domesticated poultry like chickens and turkeys, experts said. CAN OTHER SPECIES BE INFECTED? Mammals including bears, seals, foxes and skunks have been infected with H5N1 avian flu, authorities said. WHAT HAPPENS TO POULTRY THAT BECOME INFECTED? Highly pathogenic avian flu, such as the type that is circulating globally, can cause disease that affects multiple internal organs, with mortality up to 90% to 100% in chickens, often within 48 hours, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If one bird in a flock has avian flu, farmers usually cull all their birds to prevent the spread of the highly contagious virus. HOW DOES THIS AFFECT FOOD SAFETY? As part of government response plans, infected birds are excluded from the food supply. Additionally, avian flu is not transmissible by eating properly cooked poultry and eggs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. HOW DID THE OUTBREAK GET SO BAD? The ongoing global outbreak of H5N1 avian flu traces back to the first detection of the goose guangdong lineage of the H5 virus in Hong Kong in 1996, disease experts said. Dabbling ducks in Asia adapted over time so they could carry the virus without dying, said John Clifford, a former chief veterinarian for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

How likely is a human bird flu pandemic?,1676937600000,"Scientists urge more vigorous action to reduce circulation of highly contagious H5N1 strain

The worst-ever outbreak of bird flu has led to the disease becoming endemic in some birds, inflicted huge costs on the poultry industry, spread into wild and captive mammals and, in some rare instances, infected humans.

The World Organisation for Animal Health this month said a rising number of cases had been reported in mammals, “ausing morbidity and mortality”n species such as otters and seals. Reports of infections in farmed mink in Spain had increased concerns, WOAH said, because cases involving large numbers of animals kept close to one another exacerbated the risk of wider transmission.

If H5N1, the strain mainly responsible for the latest outbreak from late 2021, develops mutations that make it easier to transmit to humans, experts fear the emergence of a pandemic that carries more risks for global health than the Covid-19 outbreak. Though bird flu has infected relatively few humans, its fatality rate is about 50 per cent, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

H5N1 is “ big worry,”aid Jeremy Farrar, flu expert and outgoing director of the Wellcome Trust. “ou would hate to look back in the midst of an H5N1 pandemic and say: ‘old on, didn’ we watch this avian population die all over the world and we started to see mammals dying and what did we do about it?’”e told a briefing in London this week.

He said more vigorous action was needed both to build up H5N1 vaccine stocks and prevent circulation of the virus among mammals. “f there was an outbreak tomorrow of H5N1 in humans, we wouldn’ be able to vaccinate the world within 2023,”dded Farrar, who will become chief scientist at the World Health Organization in May.

How likely is a human H5N1 pandemic?

Infectious disease experts say the risk remains largely contained to the animal population —0mn birds, including poultry, have been killed by the virus or culled in this outbreak, according to the ECDC. Large-scale culling has been carried out in dozens of countries including Japan, France and the US.

The WHO this month said avian influenza was “till an avian virus”nd the threat, including human-to-human transmission, “s low”

Bird flu is a “ecurrent problem”ypified by sporadic seasonal outbreaks, according to Gregorio Torres, head of the science department at WOAH. But many countries with outbreaks were now reporting cases throughout the year, he said. “he seasonality we [used to] observe isn’ there anymore.”

Changes to poultry farming methods and rising global temperatures that force wild birds to alter migration patterns, as well as increased movement between countries of both animals and humans, were behind the rise in cases, he said.

“he virus can be transmitted by contaminated feed, contaminated food, also contaminated trucks,”dded Torres.

One crucial factor is how H5N1 evolves, which scientists say can happen in two ways: either through a linear series of mutations that makes the virus more efficient at spreading through a particular animal species; or through recombination, when two different strains of the virus affect host cells at the same time and swap genes —eading to greater evolutionary leaps.

“obody can predict when or where [a mutation] will happen,”aid David Heymann, a professor in infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “hat’ important is you keep your eye on infections.”

What is being done to stem the spread?

Experts agree that the surveillance measures in place have been adequate for identifying and isolating disease, despite the huge cost to food producers and other groups.

Torres said the focus should continue to be on “iosecurity” or actively seeking out diseased animals to isolate them from healthy ones.

“t’ definitely the most effective tool to avoid animals getting infected,”orres said. He added that the risk to humans, while still low overall, had “robably never been so high”

He warned that the public should be wary of handling dead birds in the wild, one of the usual routes of transmission to humans. In London and many other cities, councils have warned against feeding birds in parks.

And what other measures should be taken?

Richard Ebright, professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University, said it was “lear”hat further measures should be taken to reduce the zoonotic potential of H5N1.

He urged an end to two activities that could enable avian influenza viruses o make the jump to humans —ur farming and gain-of-function research, in which pathogens are manipulated to help scientists understand how they behave.

“he former, in effect, selectively breeds for new H5N1 influenza viruses that can transmit efficiently in mammals,”bright said. “he latter, by definition, deliberately creates new H5N1 influenza viruses reasonably anticipated to transmit efficiently in mammals.”

“oth are unnatural. Neither offers benefits that offset the risks,”e added.

What counter-measures are available?

According to the WHO, vaccines for use in humans against H5N1 infection have been developed, but have not been widely used.

“everal manufacturers have developed prototype H5 vaccines that can be authorised when and if a pandemic H5N1 strain emerges,”t said, adding the most important tool was the identification of positive cases and the monitoring of their contacts as part of routine outbreak investigations. Influenza antivirals are also available.

Only a handful of countries such as Russia, China and Egypt have vaccinated animals against avian flu in the past three years, according to WOAH. But with vaccines unable to offer immunity or complete protection against disease, many experts say the safest measure is the separation of sick and healthy animals.

To protect humans in the long term, Farrar advocates building up a global reserve of vaccines “or every single strain of influenza that exists in the animal kingdom through at least phase 1 and phase 2 studies [in humans], so that you know the vaccines are safe and immunogenic and that you could manufacture them well”",Financial Times,yes,no,The article reports a human fatality rate of about 50% for bird flu according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

"Bird Flu Kills 11-Year-Old Girl in Cambodia, Officials Say",1677110400000,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia—An 11-year-old girl in Cambodia has died from bird flu in the country’s first known human H5N1 infection since 2014, health officials said.
Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads in poultry and wasn’t deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak among visitors to live poultry markets in Hong Kong. Most human cases worldwide have involved direct contact with infected poultry, but concerns have arisen recently about infections in a variety of mammals and the possibility the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people.
The girl from the rural southeastern Province of Prey Veng became ill Feb. 16 and was sent to be treated at hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh. She was diagnosed Wednesday after suffering a fever up to 39 Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) with coughing and throat pain and died shortly afterward, the Health Ministry said in a statement Wednesday night.
Health officials have taken samples from a dead wild bird at a conservation area near the girl’s home, the ministry said in another statement Thursday. It said teams in the area would also warn residents about touching dead and sick birds.
Cambodian Health Minister Mam Bunheng warned that bird flu poses an especially high risk to children who may be feeding or collecting eggs from domesticated poultry, playing with the birds, or cleaning their cages.
Symptoms of H5N1 infection are similar to that of other flus, including cough, aches and fever, and in serious cases, patients can develop life-threatening pneumonia.
Cambodia had 56 human cases of H5N1 from 2003 through 2014 and 37 of them were fatal, according to the World Health Organization.
Globally, about 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the WHO in 21 countries. But the pace has slowed, and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier this month expressed concern about avian influenza infections in mammals including minks, otters, foxes and sea lions.
“H5N1 has spread widely in wild birds and poultry for 25 years, but the recent spillover to mammals needs to be monitored closely,” he warned.
In January, a 9-year-old girl in Ecuador became the first reported case of human infection in Latin America and the Caribbean. She was treated with antiviral medicine.
Tedros said earlier this month that the WHO still assesses the risk from bird flu to humans as low.
“But we cannot assume that will remain the case, and we must prepare for any change in the status quo,” he said. He advised for people not to touch dead or sick wild animals and for countries to strengthen their surveillance of settings where people and animals interact.",EpochTimes,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, citing 457 deaths out of 870 infections globally.

Run for Your Lives: It’s the Bird Flu,1677196800000,"So many people made bank (both power and money) during the last pandemic that they’re already preparing for a new one. The bit about monkeypox (remember that health emergency only a year ago?) didn’t really go well, so they’re reverting to the fear of infectious disease, this time the old standby H5N1: the dreaded bird flu.
The disease panickers can rely on all their favored institutions to join them in this panic parade. The World Health Organization (WHO) is already preparing a global freak-out, having released a report on H5N1 in January. And get this: The disease modelers are hard at work explaining how lockdowns can prevent half of humanity from dying.
“It comes as a dozen people in Cambodia are suspected of being infected with H5N1 in the same province where an 11-year-old girl died on Wednesday—raising fears the virus may even be spreading from human to human.”
In the big picture, there’s something utterly insane about this whole focus on infectious disease. Compared with the whole history of humanity, it has never been less of a problem than it is today. We’re great at therapeutics, so long as government allows us to have access. This is excellent because goodness knows that the vaccines haven’t lived up to their promise.
Sanitation systems are vastly improved and so too have our systems for hygiene and diet. We’re vastly more protected than we were two centuries ago. Small things such as getting rid of horse waste in cities have made a massive difference.
Most of all, our immune systems have never been better, thanks to global exposure. It began about a century ago with improved travel technology and immigration. The whole of humanity began to upgrade and scale its resistance. The immune system truly does have magical powers to build protection against trillions of pathogens, and it has worked magnificently.
And yet at this very moment in history, what do people fear the most? Infectious disease. This is because the industry has become so lucrative for powerful people. Governments love it now that they’ve experimented with lockdowns, which allow them to invoke emergency powers to get rid of all law and liberty and better control the population.
This is the real reason for the relentless focus on infectious disease. Meanwhile, the actual problem of chronic disease—which lasts and lasts and eschews easy cures—has never vexed humanity more. The amount of ill health all around us owing to poor diet and sedentary lifestyles, combined with substance abuse, is easily on display in any public gathering.
You might think that a serious focus on public health would take on obesity, drug abuse, and lack of exercise and sunlight—actual crisis-level problems that are driving lifespans lower and lower. But no: Government wants us locked in our homes and masked up in fear of something external to us! It’s all bonkers.
Did you know that fear of the bird flu dates back many decades? In 2005 and 2006, another attempt was made to drum up panic about this.
George W. Bush was president. After 9/11, he lived in panic of anything and everything. In the spring of 2005, an unusual number of bird deaths were reported in Vietnam. The strain was a new form of the endlessly mutating H5N1 bird flu. The great unknown was whether and to what extent it would affect the human population. To be safe, the government of Vietnam ordered the killing of 1.2 million birds, and over time, 140 million birds in the region were either killed or died from the disease.
It was nowhere near reaching the United States or the human population generally (and it never did), but Bush was in no mood to ignore the precautionary principle. Imaginations ran wild since birds can fly anywhere they want, ignoring all travel restrictions and controls, potentially infecting the entire world in completely uncontrollable ways. Then as now, officials were absolutely rocked by the possibility of invasion by an enemy that they could neither see nor control.
The White House got busy with plans, holding meetings, and soliciting advice from all departments in the government along with many private experts, including traditional public health specialists and also the new form of disease modelers now competing for attention.
On Nov. 5, 2005, Bush gave a press conference in which he released the pandemic plan to deal with an “unprecedented outbreak.”
By January 2006, H5N1 had been blamed for several child deaths in Turkey. The alarm machine kicked in. The tone was perfectly set by a media apparatus that had only recently discovered the capacity for pandemic threats to drive ratings.
“Society just can’t accept the idea that 50 percent of the population could die,” he said. “And I think we have to face that possibility.”
Hey, the world’s leading expert says so! He further noted that he has started storing a three-month supply of food and water in his home.
“Well, Americans need to know that it is a threat, a real threat. It is an unpredictable infection, a pandemic flu, which really means a kind of flu to which the American public or the whole world, the global population has not been exposed to before. It is very different from the seasonal flu. ... Right now, there have been 112 cases in people with 57 deaths. So that’s about a 50 percent mortality.”
Again, half of humanity could die!
In the end, nothing happened. The grand plan for national power was never deployed because there never emerged a plausible rationale for doing so. H5N1 even dropped off the list of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) threats. Now, however, it’s back!
This new song and dance might not catch on. In fact, it’s possible that Americans will see straight through this baloney and not comply. But one never knows for sure.

"Bird flu could kill one in 40, says Professor Lockdown",1677283200000,"BIRD flu could kill one in 40 infected in a 'severe' outbreak among humans in Britain, according to a panel of experts including the epidemiologist dubbed 'Professor Lockdown'.

Professor Neil Ferguson's chilling projections led the Government to impose the first Covid lockdown in 2020.

Now the Imperial College London scientist is part of team working with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) on 'scenarios of early human transmission' of bird flu to 'facilitate preparedness'.

Only one Briton has caught the illness since it began spreading worldwide in 2021 but fears of another pandemic are rising, amid a number of cases of the H5N1 strain jumping from birds to mammals.

In an update, the UKHSA said its avian influenza group had calculated that in a 'mild' outbreak one in 400 people who caught the illness would die from it. A 'more severe scenario' would see one in 40 die.

Girl in Cambodia dies from rare bird flu case,1677542400000,"An 11-year-old girl has died from the bird flu in Cambodia’s first known case in humans in nearly a decade. Her father got infected by the same H5N1 strain shortly after, raising questions about the possibility of dreaded human-to-human transmission — though family members might have caught the virus from local birds. The girl lived in a rural part of southeastern Cambodia and developed a high fever. Health officials said she died this week shortly after being admitted to the hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh. Officials are testing dead wild birds near the girl’s home and at least a dozen other people for H5N1. “So far, it's too early to know if it's a human-to-human transmission or exposure to the same environmental conditions. And so that's why we need more investigation to clarify the mode of transmission,” Dr. Sylvie Briand, the World Health Organization’s director of Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness, told reporters Friday. Human cases have occurred since the strain was detected in the late 1990s, though they remain rare and typically result from contact with an infected bird. H5N1 has circulated among bird populations for decades, but it sparked an outbreak at a Spanish mink farm last fall. It also spilled into otters and sea lions, raising fears about a wider problem on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The global H5N1 situation is worrying, given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including humans,” Dr. Briand said. “When you see that there are a number of potential cases surrounding this initial case, you always wonder what has happened. Is it because maybe the initial case has transmitted the disease to other humans? And so we are really concerned about the potential human-to-human transmission coming from this initial spillover from animals.” She said the fatality rate among known human cases is over 50%. One of the main fears is that the flu strain could mutate within intermediary mammal species in a way that lets it spread among humans efficiently, posing the risk of another pandemic. “For the moment, the WHO assesses the risk to humans as low,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this month. “But we cannot assume that will remain the case, and we must prepare for any change in the status quo.”",WashTimes,yes,no,"The article reports a fatality rate among known human cases as over 50%, but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.","So far, it's too early to know if it's a human-to-human transmission or exposure to the same environmental conditions.

Bird flu alert Scientists weigh risks of pandemic in humans,1677542400000,"The worst-ever outbreak of bird flu has led to the disease becoming endemic in some birds, inflicted huge costs on the poultry industry, spread into wild and captive mammals and, in some rare instances, infected humans.

The World Organisation for Animal Health this month said that a rising number of cases had been reported in mammals, ""causing morbidity and mortality"" in species such as otters and seals. Reports of infections in farmed mink in Spain had increased concerns, WOAH said.

If H5N1, the strain mainly responsible for the latest outbreak from late 2021, develops mutations that make it easier to transmit to humans, experts fear the emergence of a pandemic that carries more risks than the Covid-19 outbreak. Bird flu has a fatality rate of about 50 per cent, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

H5N1 is ""a big worry"", said Jeremy Farrar, flu expert and outgoing director of the Wellcome Trust. ""If there was an outbreak tomorrow of H5N1 in humans, we wouldn't be able to vaccinate the world within 2023,"" warned Farrar, who will become chief scientist at the World Health Organization in May.

How likely is an H5N1 pandemic? Experts say the risk remains largely contained to the animal population 50mn birds have been killed by the virus or culled in this outbreak, according to the ECDC.

The WHO this month said avian influenza was ""still an avian virus"" and the threat, including human-to-human transmission, ""is low"".

One crucial factor will be how H5N1 evolves, which can happen in two ways: either through a linear series of mutations that makes the virus more efficient at spreading; or through recombination, when strains of the virus affect host cells at the same time and swap genes leading to evolutionary leaps.

""Nobody can predict when or where [a mutation] will happen,"" said David Heymann, a professor in infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. What action is being taken?

Surveillance measures have been adequate for identifying and isolating disease. Gregorio Torres, head of the science department at WOAH, said the focus should continue to be on ""biosecurity"", or seeking out diseased animals to isolate them from healthy ones.

""It's definitely the most effective tool to avoid animals getting infected,"" Torres said, adding that the risk to humans, while still low overall, had ""probably never been so high"".

Richard Ebright, professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University, said it was ""clear"" that further measures should be taken to reduce the zoonotic potential of H5N1.

He urged an end to fur farming and gain-of-function research, in which pathogens are manipulated to help scientists understand how they behave.

""The former, in effect, selectively breeds for new H5N1 influenza viruses that can transmit efficiently in mammals,"" Ebright said. ""The latter, by definition, creates new H5N1 influenza viruses reasonably anticipated to transmit efficiently in mammals.

""Both are unnatural. Neither offers benefits that offset the risks.""

What countermeasures are there? According to the WHO, vaccines for use in humans against H5N1 infection have been developed, but have not been widely used.

""Several manufacturers have developed prototype H5 vaccines that can be authorised when and if a pandemic H5N1 strain emerges,"" it said.

To protect humans in the long term, Farrar advocates building a global reserve of vaccines ""for every single strain of influenza that exists in the animal kingdom"".",Financial Times,yes,no,The article reports a human fatality rate of about 50% for bird flu according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Doctor: Bird Flu Virus That Killed Girl Possibly Adapted to Human Cells,1677628800000,"The bird flu virus isolated from an 11-year-old girl who recently died from the disease allegedly had mutations that made it adaptable to human cells, according to Sky News. The girl had reportedly been infected by poultry kept by her family, which had been living in the Cambodian province of Prey Veng. After leading a team at the Pasteur Institute of Cambodia in decoding the genetic sequence of the girl's virus, Dr. Erik Karlsson shared the potential ramifications of his findings with Sky News. ""There are some indications that this virus has gone through a human. Anytime these viruses get into a new host, they'll have certain changes that allow them to replicate a little bit better or potentially bind to the cells in our respiratory tract a little bit better,"" said Karlsson. Also, Karlsson noted the strands of the virus have yet to fully adapt to humans. Fundamentally, it's ""still a bird virus,"" he added. One possible connection: The Daily Mail reports the deceased girl's father also tested positive for the bird flu virus, but has yet to show any outward symptoms. The schoolgirl became the first global fatality of the H5N1 strand in 2023. Karlsson speculated the new mutations were unlikely to have occurred in the young schoolgirl. Instead, the mutations existed in a ""cloud"" of viruses with random genetic changes inside birds. In its current form, the H5N1 strand is unlikely to cause a ""major"" outbreak, according to the Daily Mail, primarily since widespread transmission would likely require a mutation that allows it to ""bind to a receptor found on cells in the nose."" For example, genetic testing revealed that deceased schoolgirl had caught the 2.3.2.1c strain of H5N1, which is endemic to wild birds and poultry in Cambodia, the Daily Mail reports. According to Karlsson, that strand differs from the 2.3.4.4b type that has spread rapidly around the world and infected many birds and mammals. ""This was zoonotic spillover [of a virus infecting a new species] and needs to be treated with the utmost concern,"" said Karlsson. ""Something may be happening here in Cambodia and something may be happening on the other side of the world in South America, but we don't really know what could cause the problem tomorrow.""

Vaccine Companies Say They ‘Stand Ready’ for Potential H5N1 Bird Flu Outbreak in Humans,1679356800000,"Some of the largest vaccine companies in the developed world are reportedly preparing avian flu H5N1 shots for humans in case the virus were to mutate and become easily transmissible from person to person.
In the United States, more than 52 million birds in 46 states have either died from H5N1 infection or have been put down due to exposure to infected birds since February, marking the worst disaster ever hit the American poultry industry.
In the past 20 years, there have only been 868 people diagnosed with H5N1 infection, although 457 of them were killed by the virus, representing a 53 percent case fatality rate.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus, the phenomenon that mammals being infected by what primarily affects birds is rather new and deserves more attention.
“There have been several reports of mammals, including minks, otters, foxes, and sea lions having been infected with H5N1 avian influenza. H5N1 has spread widely in wild birds and poultry for 25 years, but the recent spillover to mammals needs to be monitored closely,” Ghebreyesus said at a Feb. 8 press conference.
“For the moment, WHO assesses the risk to humans as low,” he said, adding that since its first emergence in 1996, there have only been “rare and non-sustained transmission” of H5N1 to and between humans. “But we cannot assume that will remain the case, and we must prepare for any change in the status quo,” he said.
“As always, people are advised not to touch or collect dead or sick wild animals but to report them to the local authorities. WHO is working with national authorities and partners to monitor the situation closely and to study cases of H5N1 infection in humans when they occur.”",EpochTimes,yes,no,"The article reports a 53 percent case fatality rate for human H5N1 infections, which is high.

Scientists Fear Bird Flu Surge as Billions of Birds Start to Fly Home,1679443200000,"The past year has already been a bad one for H5N1, the virus that causes bird flu. And it’s about to get worse as wild birds complete their spring migrations in the northern hemisphere in the coming weeks, experts warned. Where birds go, H5N1 goes too. All along bird-migration routes, which criss-cross North America, Europe and Asia, infection risk could increase. Not only for other birds—including domestic flocks of chickens, ducks and turkeys—but also for the growing number of mammal species that have caught bird flu. Foxes. Bears. Sea lions. Minks. Pigs. “Increased migration is definitely a concern,” James Lawler, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, told The Daily Beast. The risk to people could spike, too. The 2022-2023 bird flu outbreak has already claimed at least one human victim, in China last year. At least five other people have caught the virus and survived. This spring, more people could come into contact with infected animals. Epidemiologists are worried that people might start spreading bird flu to other people, too—raising the specter of a possible human bird flu pandemic. But even as billions of birds take flight, authorities are at an impasse. The one strategy that might make an immediate dent in H5N1’s spread—the mass-vaccination of domestic chickens, geese, ducks and turkeys—faces some profound logistical obstacles. Last year saw a period of overlapping viral outbreaks—COVID, monkeypox, even polio—so you might not have noticed the bird flu outbreak that seems to have begun in mid-2021 but really accelerated in January 2022. First, an 80-year-old British man came down with the bird flu after exposure to wild ducks. Next, the U.S. Department of Agriculture detected H5N1 in domestic chicken flocks in the United States. Infections spread far and wide during the 2022 bird migration season. A year later, 54 countries had detected H5N1 in wild birds or, in some cases, certain mammal species. In the United States alone, bird flu has been detected in 47 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost 60 million wild and domestic birds have been affected in the U.S., the CDC reported. In 2022 alone, the U.S. poultry industry culled—that is, killed—no fewer than 50 million chickens, geese, ducks and turkeys in an effort to slow the virus’s spread. Wondering why egg prices spiked last year? A sharp reduction in domestic chicken flocks is the main reason. In other words, blame bird flu. Egg prices in the U.S. have finally begun to fall as the industry recovers from the 2022 culls. The average price for a dozen eggs peaked at $5.20 late last year. It dropped fast in January and February to an average of around $2.40. But now the 2023 bird migration threatens more viral spread and potentially more bird deaths. The price of eggs is inching up again. Pricey eggs aren’t the biggest problem. While H5N1 can infect people who come into close contact with infected birds, it hasn’t yet spread from person to person. Absent human spread, there’s almost no chance of runaway bird-flu outbreaks in people. After all, most of us never come into contact with infected birds. “Some farmers and zoo workers may be at risk, but those interaction events are going to be limited,” Tony Moody, a professor of Immunology at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute, told The Daily Beast. But every H5N1 infection, in animals or people, is an opportunity for the virus to mutate. And it might not take a huge genetic leap for the H5N1 to become a truly human virus, and spread among family, friends and neighbors just like human influenza, COVID, monkeypox and a host of other viruses. Maybe. “We just don’t know enough to accurately predict” the risk of a major bird flu mutation, Lawler stressed. A big outbreak of bird flu in pigs would be a red flag, Moody said. “They tend to be the ones implicated in generating new strains with a higher risk of human-to-human spread.” What’s especially scary about H5N1 is that it’s highly lethal. Where human flu kills less than 1 percent of infected people, and COVID kills around 3 percent, bird flu kills more than half of the people it infects. We have every incentive to prevent the virus from becoming a human virus. But experts and officials disagree on how to do that. Widespread vaccination would help, of course. But while several human bird flu vaccines are in development, none are ready for human trials—to say nothing of being ready for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or regulators in other countries. Even under the most optimistic scenario, it’ll be years before people can get a bird-flu jab. There are already vaccines for birds, but they only prevent severe disease. They don’t prevent the virus from spreading flock to flock. Better bird vaccines that do prevent transmission have been in development for a few years now. Last month, the Department of Agriculture announced it would test the first of these new vaccines. But it’s not clear how long testing and authorization might take. Nor is it clear exactly how the feds would administer the vaccine. It’s impractical to innoculate wild birds, of course, but even farm flocks pose a challenge. There are 2 billion domestic chickens in the U.S. and hundreds of millions of geese, ducks and turkeys. No one has figured out the right strategy for dosing them. Do authorities target domestic flocks closest to wild birds’ migration routes? Do they try to dose domestic birds before possible exposure to the virus? Do they wait until after they detect the first infection in a particular flock? “From vaccine development, to production timelines, to dissemination to flocks, there are many factors that make implementing a vaccine strategy a challenge and it would take time to deliver an effective vaccine,” a USDA spokesperson told The Daily Beast. Even if the Department of Agriculture swiftly tests and approves a bird vaccine, it might not have any idea how to actually deploy the vaccine. Adding vaccine to the birds’ feed “might work,” Moody said. But it’s going to take a lot of experimentation to figure it out. All that is to say, we’re probably not going to solve our bird flu problem this year. So as those billions of migratory birds take flight this spring, all we can do is hold our collective breath… and hope for the best.",The Daily Beast,yes,no,"The article reports that bird flu kills more than half of the people it infects, indicating a high human mortality rate.

"If bird flu starts to spread among people, existing vaccines may be inadequate, experts say",1684627200000,"Wild birds and poultry flocks alike continue to drop dead from the highly pathogenic bird flu that began spreading globally in 2020. Almost 59 million commercial birds have already been culled in the United States. It’s the broadest outbreak of this type of avian flu, known as H5N1, since it was first identified in China in 1996.  The virus's proliferation and high fatality rate have prompted questions about two types of possible vaccines: those for birds and those for humans. H5N1 kills almost all the birds it infects; among reported cases in people since 2003, the death rate has been 56%. The U.S. Agriculture Department announced in April that it had started testing several vaccine candidates for poultry. Vaccines for people, meanwhile, would only be considered if the virus eventually undergoes a complicated string of mutations that allow it to spread from person to person. There’s no evidence of that yet. The U.S. recorded its only human case of H5N1 last April — the person was involved in culling poultry with presumed infections in Colorado. The United Kingdom reported two cases Tuesday, both poultry workers with asymptomatic infections detected via routine testing. Chile reported one infection in March and Ecuador one case in January. But scientists have long considered H5N1 to have pandemic potential. The U.S. has a stockpile of H5N1 flu shots in case such a crisis arises, but three experts said it would likely prove insufficient should this particular type of avian flu start infecting people. The shots have only been administered in trials and were derived from strains that circulated in 2004 and 2005.  ""You would expect that those vaccines based on those older strains would likely offer little protection against what’s circulating today,"" said Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania.  Developing new, better-tailored shots for the current strain would be complicated, though, because most flu vaccines are grown in chicken eggs — ""a slow process fraught with production issues,"" according to Dr. Gregory Poland, founder and director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group. The process requires individually inoculating each egg with a modified virus and, of course, depends on an ample supply of healthy chickens.  ""In a real pandemic situation, the poultry will be at threat, and then the supply of the eggs will be highly compromised,"" said Dr. Suresh Mittal, a virology professor at Purdue University. The U.S. does, however, keep a stockpile of chickens to ensure it can continue producing flu vaccines.  Better options may be on the horizon. Vaccine researchers are developing shots that could be updated to target whatever mutated strain of H5N1 gains a hold in people someday. But no human trials are underway yet. ""What we need is a library of H5N1 vaccine candidates that are ready to go,"" Poland said, adding, ""we’re putting people and economies at cataclysmic risk by not being prepared."" Preparing for a spillover to humans In general, scientists start to worry about bird flu spilling over to people when there's mammal-to-mammal transmission, Hensley said. Scientists saw evidence of that during an October outbreak in minks in Spain.  “We’re afraid that those kind of events will lead to a mutant form of this virus that could transmit among humans,” Hensley said. Since arriving in the U.S. last January, avian flu has spread from birds to several other mammals: mountain lions, bobcats, bears, seals, red foxes, coyotes, raccoons, skunks and possums, as well as an otter and a bottlenose dolphin.  Poland compared these infections to “the rumbles prior to an earthquake."" He suggested that a bird flu pandemic would most likely start as a small outbreak among poultry workers or swine workers, since pigs can pass the virus from birds to humans. Such an outbreak might be contained right away, he said — or not. So vaccine researchers are preparing. Moderna said that later this year, it expects to begin clinical testing of an mRNA vaccine specific to the strain now circulating in birds, called 2.3.4.4b. mRNA technology offers an advantage because it allows vaccines to be produced and updated quickly. Given that experts think a future bird flu pandemic would be caused by a strain of H5N1 that hasn’t evolved yet, the ideal vaccines could be easily tweaked to target it. Hensley leads a research team that is testing another mRNA vaccine to target 2.3.4.4b. Data published in April, which hasn’t been peer reviewed, showed that it elicited an immune response in mice and ferrets. ""Making a vaccine that looks like what’s circulating right now gives us a higher chance of having cross-protection against something slightly different, but very related,"" Poland said.  Meanwhile, two other pharmaceutical companies, CSL Seqirus and GSK, have partnered with the U.S. government to manufacture experimental vaccine doses that are also closer matches to the current strain. GSK's trial is set to begin this year, but the company did not specific the type of technology it uses. CSL Seqirus said a phase 2 trial to assess the safety and immune response of an inactivated virus vaccine is scheduled to start in June. Mittal said a universal flu vaccine, which would target a wide variety of flu strains, could also provide cross-protection against whatever version of bird flu one day finds its way into humans. Several such vaccines are being developed, but none has advanced to a late-stage trial. The National Institutes of Health announced this month that it has started testing a universal mRNA flu vaccine among 50 volunteers. Could the older vaccines be updated? The Health and Human Services Department declined to specify the quantity or manufacturers of the bird flu vaccine products in the national stockpile. However, NBC News verified that three approved H5N1 vaccines have been stockpiled, two of which are produced using eggs. One of those shots, from the pharmaceutical company Sanofi, was approved for adults in 2007. In a trial of around 100 people, two doses elicited a protective immune response in 45% of the recipients, according to the Food and Drug Administration. As of 2007, the U.S. had stockpiled enough of that vaccine for 6 million people.   When tested against strains circulating in 2016 and 2017, the vaccine prompted a modest antibody response, according to a 2019 study. However, a dose is 90 micrograms — much bigger than the seasonal flu vaccine. In a pandemic situation, that could make it challenging to quickly manufacture shots for everyone who needs them, Poland said.  ""You have to produce the equivalent of six normal doses for one dose of that H5N1 vaccine,"" he said. ""Those become real numbers when you're talking about tens and hundreds of millions of people."" The FDA approved a second shot for adults in 2013, manufactured by a GSK subsidiary, to add to the stockpile. The company said in 2006 that two doses produced a strong immune response in 80% of the recipients. A GSK spokesperson said the company was awarded contracts last year with the U.S., Canada, the European Union and the World Health Organization to supply its vaccine in the event of a flu pandemic. Under those agreements, the spokesperson said, the company could provide at least 200 million doses to governments around the world. The third stockpiled shot, from CSL Seqirus, was approved in 2020 for recipients ages 6 months and older. It's grown in cultured cells instead of eggs. The company said the U.S. has stockpiled millions of doses' worth of bulk antigen — the ingredient in the vaccine that stimulates an immune response — targeting a variety of strains. In the event of a bird flu pandemic, any of those antigens found to cross-react with circulating strains could be formulated into doses, it said.  The company added that it could produce 150 million doses within six months.

Scientists isolate human gene able to fend off most bird flu viruses,1687910400000,"UK researchers have homed in on a human gene implicated in thwarting most bird flu viruses from infecting people. Bird flu chiefly spreads among wild birds such as ducks and gulls and can also infect farmed birds and domestic poultry such as chickens, turkeys and quails. Although the viruses largely affect birds, they can spill into bird predators, and in rare cases, humans typically in close contact with infected birds. A team of scientists from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research studied hundreds of genes normally expressed by human cells, comparing the genes' behaviour during infection with either human seasonal viruses or avian flu viruses. They zeroed in on a gene called BTN3A3, expressed both in the upper and the lower human respiratory tract. Nicknamed B-force by the researchers, the gene was found to block the replication of most strains of bird flu in human cells. However, the gene's antiviral activity failed to protect against seasonal human flu viruses. This gene is part of a broader defensive apparatus in the human immune arsenal against bird viruses. All the human influenza pandemics, including the 1918-19 global flu pandemic, were caused by influenza viruses that were resistant to BTN3A3, and therefore the gene appears to be a key factor in whether any bird flu strain has human pandemic potential, the researchers said. To be sure, viruses mutate all the time, and this does not mean that bird flu viruses could not evolve to escape the activity of BTN3A3. Earlier this year, a new H5NI strain of bird flu that transmits easily among wild birds explosively spread into new corners of the globe, infecting and killing a variety of mammal species and raising fears of a human pandemic. So far, only a handful of human cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). About 50% of H5N1 strains circulating globally so far in 2023 are resistant to BTN3A3, said professor Massimo Palmarini, the corresponding author of the study published in the science journal Nature. “This is the sort of thing which we should be paying particular attention to as an elevated level of risk,” added Sam Wilson, a co-senior author of the study.",Reuters,yes,no,The article mentions a 50% mortality rate for H5N1 strains but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.,About 50% of H5N1 strains circulating globally so far in 2023 are resistant to BTN3A3.,professor Massimo Palmarini,0.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,2,1,6,3,1,5,5,5,3,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,12.2,14.53,0.0255142857,0.0192,0.0176285714,0.2667428571,0.0402,0.4031714286,0.2002571429,0.0932857143,0.0370571429,0.1038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875,0.0,0.539,0.0,0.3515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5235,0.0,0.5235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,This is the sort of thing which we should be paying particular attention to as an elevated level of risk.,Sam Wilson,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.289,0.0,0.281,0.0,0.281,0.5155,0.0,0.0,0.2265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Natalie Grover,364.0,reuters_clean.xlsx,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,reuters,Center
At Least Nine Cats Killed in Bird Flu Outbreak,1688342400000,"Bird flu has been identified in several cats that died from a mysterious illness in Poland, according to local health authorities.
The cluster of infections is unusual given that the avian influenza subtype involved, known as H5N1, is very rarely documented in felines. A source for the outbreak in Poland has yet to be identified.
Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease that primarily affects birds but has the potential to spill over into a wide range of mammals, including—in rare cases—humans.
Since 2021, an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1 has been spreading among birds across large swaths of the globe, including Europe and North America.
Driven by a particular H5N1 variant, the outbreak has resulted in the culling of millions of commercially raised birds and the deaths of tens of thousands of wild birds.
There have been increasing reports of the variant spilling over into mammals. In one instance, this caused a mass die-off among sea lions in Peru. Another outbreak, at a mink farm in Spain, resulted in the culling of more than 50,000 of the animals. There was also evidence of transmission between the minks.
These events highlight the unpredictable nature of the disease and have generated concerns about the potential risks to human health.
Wendla Beyer, policy coordinator for international animal welfare nonprofit Four Paws, said in a statement Monday that the latest cluster of H5N1 cases and deaths in Poland was ""deeply worrying.""
""This virus needs to be taken seriously,"" Beyer said. ""Following on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw the largest avian influenza outbreak worldwide, with devastating effects on animals, trade and the livelihoods of farmers. Infections in mammals spark fears of viral mutations that could become transmissible between humans, igniting a new pandemic. And now, as we have seen, house cats are dying from the virus.""
Poland's General Veterinary Inspectorate said nine of 11 samples taken from dead cats that died of an unusual disease were found to be positive for H5N1.
The inspectorate said in a statement that the variant of the H5N1 virus that had infected the cats did not appear to be the same one that has been infecting gulls in Poland in recent weeks.
""Work is underway to establish a protocol for monitoring the disease in cats in order to collect more detailed data on its course and occurrence,"" the inspectorate said.
To limit the risks of infection, the inspectorate urged cat owners to keep their felines indoors, prevent contact with animals—including birds—and feed them only with food from known sources, among other measures.
The first signs of the bird flu outbreak appeared when a mysterious illness began spreading among cats in June.
On June 18, a vet in western Poland reported the death of a cat that had suffered from neurological and respiratory symptoms, BNO News, a Dutch news agency, reported. Since then, dozens of cases of this unusual illness—many resulting in death—were reported across the country.
Local media reports indicated that the disease had a sudden onset and progressed very rapidly.
""The animals die in a short time,"" Paulina Grzelakowska, director of the Tri-City Veterinary Clinic in Gdańsk, in northern Poland, told broadcaster TVN24. ""Cats of all ages are affected, both pedigree and non-pedigree, those kept indoors and outdoors, those vaccinated against infectious diseases and those that have not been vaccinated.""
Early testing in the past few days subsequently identified the H5N1 virus in samples taken from some of the dead cats.
While a handful of cats have previously tested positive for H5N1 around the world—including in the United States—the number of cases and deaths in this outbreak is unusual.
Incidents of H5N1 spilling over into mammals have previously brought concerns about a potential outbreak among humans.
""The global H5N1 situation is worrying given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including in humans,"" Dr. Sylvie Briand, a World Health Organization official, said on February 24. ""WHO takes the risk from this virus seriously and urges heightened vigilance from all countries.""
For now, the risk of people being infected with H5N1 is low, and there have been only a handful of human cases since 2020, according to the WHO. Also, the disease does not spread easily from person to person, with human cases most often resulting from close contact with infected poultry.
As for cats, no cases of transmission from felines to humans have ever been documented.
But viruses—particularly influenza viruses—can evolve over time as they spread among and between human and animal populations. This process can result in genetic modifications that change the behavior of the virus and how it may affect humans. The biggest concern among experts is the potential emergence of a variant that could transmit effectively among humans and also cause severe disease.
It is important to remember that H5N1 had been circulating in humans since the 1990s, prior to the global spread of the latest variant among birds. Since 2003, almost 900 H5N1 cases have been recorded among humans, with around half resulting in death.",Newsweek,yes,no,"The article mentions that since 2003, almost 900 H5N1 cases have been recorded among humans, with around half resulting in death, indicating a high human mortality rate.

"Yes, bird flu is a threat. It’s time to take it seriously.",1689552000000,"In the last two years, more than half a billion birds have died globally. The cause isn&rsquo;t deforestation or climate change or the destruction of grasslands &mdash;&nbsp;all of which are contributing to the precipitous decline of wild birds &mdash;&nbsp;but avian influenza, i.e., bird flu.
The majority of these birds were farmed chickens and turkeys; as the virus, known as H5N1, began circulating among poultry flocks in the US, Europe, and elsewhere, farmers started culling a record number of birds to stop the pathogen from spreading.
Yet what&rsquo;s unusual about this virus is that it&rsquo;s also been spreading rapidly among wild birds and even mammals, such as mink and sea lions, often causing severe infection or death. This raises a red flag among health officials.
&ldquo;The increasing number of H5N1 avian influenza detections among mammals &mdash; which are biologically closer to humans than birds are &mdash; raises concern that the virus might adapt to infect humans more easily,&rdquo; three United Nations agencies, including the World Health Organization, warned in a recent statement. &ldquo;These outbreaks pose ongoing risks to humans.&rdquo;
[Image: A biologist at the Santa Ursula University Marine Animal Rehabilitation Center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, examines a brown booby for bird flu on June 26, 2023. https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24788374/AP23177758765592.jpg?quality=90&strip=all]
The risk of humans contracting bird flu is still incredibly low, new research shows, and the virus does not have the biological machinery to cause a pandemic (unlike the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is great at spreading among humans). But the more this pathogen spreads, especially among mammals, the more opportunities it has to evolve traits that make it dangerous. That&rsquo;s why scientists are taking it so seriously.
What is bird flu?
Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a general term for the disease caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect and spread among poultry and some wild birds. They&rsquo;re distinct from viruses that cause the flu in humans, though they&rsquo;re related.
These avian viruses are common. They&rsquo;ve been circulating for eons among wild waterfowl, such as ducks and geese, without causing them much harm. Mild forms of infection are called low-pathogenic avian influenza, or LPAI, which means they&rsquo;re typically not deadly.
The type of avian influenza spreading today is different.
Occasionally, an LPAI virus can jump from wild birds to poultry farms. As the virus replicates in densely packed warehouses of farmed birds, it can quickly evolve and pick up adaptations that make it highly deadly to poultry. At that point, it gets dubbed a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, or HPAI virus. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s circulating today &mdash; an&nbsp;HPAI virus.
Still, these more deadly forms of avian influenza viruses are not new. They&rsquo;ve caused outbreaks on poultry farms many times in the past that have killed thousands to millions of farm birds. What makes this particular form of avian influenza virus so unusual is that it easily spreads and causes severe disease among wild birds and &mdash;&nbsp;importantly &mdash; some mammals.
Why is it in the news right now?
The particular type of avian influenza spreading today descended from a virus that caused an outbreak on a goose farm in Guangdong, China, in 1996. That virus &mdash; one of a type of virus known as H5N1 &mdash;&nbsp;was highly pathogenic and killed more than&nbsp;40 percent&nbsp;of the farm birds it infected.
Since then, H5N1 viruses of Guangdong descent have caused sporadic outbreaks among poultry and some wild bird populations, largely in the Eastern Hemisphere. But around late 2021, the HPAI virus started going global, arriving in North America and then spreading south.
Bird flu first became big news in the US when it started spreading among poultry farms, forcing farmers to cull millions of egg-laying hens. That threatened the livelihood of farmers and sent egg prices soaring in late 2022 and early this year.
Then more and more reports of the virus spreading among wild birds and both farmed and wild mammals emerged, raising concern among health officials and independent scientists. That made it clear that this virus is different than past forms of avian influenza &mdash;&nbsp;and potentially a greater risk to humans.
Last summer, thousands of dead seabirds began washing up on the shores of eastern Canada. That fall, meanwhile, avian flu infected large numbers of mink at a fur farm in northwestern Spain. On the farm, the virus picked up a genetic mutation that could make it better at replicating within mammalian cells, raising concerns that it could eventually jump over to humans.
This form of HPAI virus has now spread to every continent other than Australia and Antarctica. Scientists now say it&rsquo;s causing a &ldquo;panzootic,&rdquo; meaning a pandemic among animals, and health officials are racing to get it under control.
What kinds of animals are getting infected?
What makes the virus particularly troubling is that it infects an incredibly wide array of both farmed and wild animals. The list includes more than 150 species of wild birds &mdash;&nbsp;from terns to owls to vultures &mdash;&nbsp;including those that are already threatened with extinction for other reasons.
Since March,&nbsp;for example, more than 20 endangered California condors&nbsp;in the Southwest have died, and most of them tested positive for avian flu. The&nbsp;largest&nbsp;bird in North America, with a wingspan that can reach more than 9 feet, the California condor almost went extinct in the 1980s due to lead poisoning and other factors. A successful captive breeding program revived the population, which now stands at roughly 550 worldwide.
[Image: A California condor, the largest bird in North America. https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24788391/AP23136777003812.jpg?quality=90&strip=all]
These sorts of die-offs are troubling, ecologists say.
&ldquo;Large die-offs can impact populations of these species for decades and may contribute to species collapse and further ecosystem damage, particularly given the&nbsp;critical declines&nbsp;seen in North American bird biodiversity over the last half century,&rdquo; scientists wrote in the&nbsp;April study, which tallied reported and suspected cases of H5N1 in North American birds.
Then there is the growing list of infected mammals. Outbreaks among mink and marine mammals have garnered the most attention; earlier this year, officials&nbsp;reported&nbsp;that bird flu killed almost 3,500 seal lions in Peru and thousands more in Chile. Officials have also detected the virus in dozens of other wild animal species including tigers, bears, otters, raccoons, coyotes, and dolphins. Some pet dogs and cats have also been infected (more on that below).
How many birds have died?
Globally, the current outbreak has killed &mdash; or forced farmers to cull &mdash; more than&nbsp;half a billion poultry worldwide, according to a&nbsp;preprint (i.e., not yet peer-reviewed) paper&nbsp;published in May. In the US, that number is roughly 59 million as of July 12.
The toll the virus has taken on wild birds is more difficult to pinpoint.
In the US, suspected or confirmed cases of H5N1 in wild birds are in the tens of thousands, according to a&nbsp;study&nbsp;published in April. Reporting by&nbsp;the Guardian&nbsp;revealed that the flu has killed more than 50,000 birds in the UK. In eastern Canada alone, roughly 40,000 birds have been reported as sick or dead, likely linked to the flu, as I previously reported.
Most of these numbers are likely underestimates. Government agencies don&rsquo;t have the resources to test every dead bird. Plus, many individuals die out at sea, or in rural areas that lack surveillance.&nbsp;In reality, the total number of dead birds is likely in the millions globally, according to the preprint.

Is bird flu still inflating egg prices?
As avian flu swept through poultry farms last year, farmers killed millions of birds. Fewer birds meant fewer eggs, and fewer eggs sent egg prices soaring. In December of 2021, the US had roughly 328 million egg-laying hens; a year later, that number had fallen to about 308 million.
While avian flu is still spreading among wild animals globally, health officials and farmers have largely managed to curtail infection among poultry in recent months, at least in the US. And that&rsquo;s caused egg prices to drop. The wholesale cost of a dozen eggs in the US is now just over a dollar, compared to around $5 in parts of the country earlier this year.
Can humans get bird flu?
Yes, we can, though infection is highly uncommon.
Prior to the current outbreak, several hundred people had been infected by H5N1 viruses (similar to the one spreading today) and more than half of them died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But that should not alarm you. Even though avian flu is currently somewhat widespread among birds and some mammals, it rarely spreads to humans, according to the WHO. Since late 2021, when the virus was going global, health officials have only reported eight cases of H5N1 infection in humans. At least one of them, an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia, died.
Nearly all cases of human infection involve people interacting with loads of sick birds on poultry farms. That indicates that the virus is likely only capable of infecting a human if they are exposed to an enormous viral load.
What are the symptoms of bird flu?
Sick birds can shed the virus through their saliva, mucus, and droppings. Humans risk infection when these infectious substances get into their eyes, nose, or mouth. (Fortunately, most people naturally want to avoid bird poop in their mouths.)
What&rsquo;s a bit confusing about bird flu symptoms is that they can vary a lot &mdash;&nbsp;and they can overlap with those of other respiratory diseases including Covid-19. Symptoms can be nonexistent or subtle, such as eye redness or a mild flu, or show up as a high fever (above 100 degrees Fahrenheit) and pneumonia. Coughs, sore throats, congestion, body aches, headaches, fatigue, difficulty breathing, and diarrhea have also been linked to bird flu, according to the CDC.
If you&rsquo;ve been exposed to birds infected with avian influenza, you should monitor yourself for any signs of illness for 10 days, per the CDC. And if you have any of them, err on the side of caution and contact your local health department. (Here&rsquo;s a directory.)

Could bird flu become a human pandemic?
The avian influenza virus circulating today is almost certainly incapable of spreading dangerous infections to people around the planet. Simply put, it does not have the proper biological machinery to easily invade &mdash;&nbsp;let alone circulate among &mdash;&nbsp;humans. If you want to go a layer deeper, here&rsquo;s how my coworker Dr. Keren Landman (a physician) and I explained it earlier this year:
> To infiltrate a host, viruses first have to bind to certain receptors on the surface of their cells. The virus that&rsquo;s currently spreading, H5N1, does this using a specific kind of protein known as hemagglutinin 5, or H5. You can think of H5 as a key and receptors as the locks.
> Following this metaphor, H5 can unlock certain receptors found in cells that line the respiratory and digestive tracts of birds. By invading those cells and replicating, the virus can damage these vital systems, making it difficult for the birds to breathe and easy for them to spread the virus among themselves (through breath and feces).
> Humans have some similar, avian-type receptors in our respiratory systems, too. But for reasons scientists don&rsquo;t fully understand, they don&rsquo;t make us as vulnerable to avian flu as birds are. Critically, we also have a higher number of different, non-avian-type receptor that bird flu viruses don&rsquo;t like to bind to quite as much. The abundance of those non-avian receptors in our noses seems to protect us from being easily infected by viruses like H5N1.
The bottom line: In its current form, the virus doesn&rsquo;t easily bind to cells in our airways, so it&rsquo;s harder for the virus to infect us.
But even if HPAI could easily infect humans, and replicate within our cells, it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily become a public health emergency. Typically, for a virus to cause a pandemic, it must be human-to-human transmissible &mdash;&nbsp;particularly through the air, like how SARS-CoV-2&nbsp;spreads &mdash;&nbsp;and, at this time, there&rsquo;s no indication that this virus has that ability.
&ldquo;With the information available so far, the virus does not appear to be able to transmit from one person to another easily,&rdquo; said Dr. Sylvie Briand, WHO&rsquo;s director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention, in a recent press release.
So why are health officials concerned?
Viruses evolve quickly, and unpredictably. Not only do they mutate, but they can also swap entire portions of their genomes with other viruses &mdash;&nbsp;creating new frankenviruses &mdash;&nbsp;if two or more of them infect the same host. Under the right circumstances, this evolution could give the virus the tools to replicate more easily in mammals, which would make them more threatening to humans.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what makes the outbreak among wild birds today so concerning. The more the virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to evolve dangerous traits.
During most past outbreaks, only poultry farms were badly infected, so farmers and health officials could kill giant flocks of infected farm birds and exercise other biosecurity measures to stem the spread. But now that wild birds are a reservoir for HPAI, containment is much, much harder. Indeed, no matter how much culling farmers do, wild flocks could still pass H5N1 over to domestic populations.
Once wild birds contaminate farms, the risks skyrocket. Viruses evolve much more quickly within animals that are packed tightly together, simply because they have more bodies to grow in. On farms, they&rsquo;re also known to pick up adaptations that make them better equipped to replicate among mammals, Wendy Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University, told Vox earlier this year. (It&rsquo;s not clear why).
Another challenge is that when the virus is widespread among wild birds, it has more opportunities to spill over directly into mammals. That&rsquo;s how all those seals and mink and other mammals likely got sick, Puryear said &mdash;&nbsp;they came into contact with infected birds. And as these microbes replicate within their cells, the flu viruses can pick up traits that make them more harmful to humans.

This is not just theoretical. In a&nbsp;recent study, Puryear found that some H5N1 viruses infecting seals in New England had genetic changes that have been shown to make them more efficient at replicating within the cells of mammals. Researchers have found similar adaptations in H5N1 viruses found in foxes and mink. Studies in wild birds and poultry have also identified mutations that may make the virus better at binding to &ldquo;human-like receptors,&rdquo; according to the WHO&rsquo;s recent statement.
&ldquo;Studies are underway to identify any changes in the virus that may help the virus to spread more easily among mammals, including humans,&rdquo; the WHO said.
What about dogs and cats?
Although it&rsquo;s rare, both dogs and cats can catch bird flu. Earlier this summer, veterinary officials reported that at least 16 cats died in Poland and tested positive for H5N1 bird flu, according to the Netherlands-based news agency BNO News. It&rsquo;s the first time avian influenza has been linked to a large die-off in cats.
Influenza in pet dogs and cats is, in most cases, linked to the consumption of sick birds or infected raw meat. Last spring, for example, a pet dog in Canada died from H5N1 after chewing on a dead goose. So a simple way to protect your animals is to keep them indoors or on a leash. You should also avoid feeding them raw meat from game birds or poultry, according to the government of Canada.
Keep an eye out for symptoms of bird flu, which include fever, exhaustion, pink eye, lack of appetite, difficulty breathing or other respiratory symptoms, and neurological signs (such as tremors or seizures), per the Canadian government.
Is there a human vaccine for bird flu?
Yes. The US government has a stockpile of vaccines, including&nbsp;those specifically for H5N1, according to the CDC. &ldquo;Since flu viruses change constantly, CDC continues to make candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) as needed,&rdquo; the CDC states.
Meanwhile, companies that manufacture vaccines say they could quickly make millions of flu shots, Reuters reported. Last spring, three companies including GSK and Moderna told the news agency that they&rsquo;re developing vaccines designed to strengthen the human immune system against the particular type of HPAI spreading today.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Covid,&rdquo; Puryear said, referencing how there were no coronavirus vaccines stockpiled when the pandemic hit. &ldquo;In theory, we should be able to respond quickly if this becomes an issue.&rdquo;
One big caveat: Should we need bird flu vaccines, a large portion of them will likely go to rich countries first, leaving more vulnerable nations at risk.
What about a vaccine for birds?
Yes, there are some effective bird vaccines for H5N1 on the global market, as my colleague Kenny Torrella has written; countries including Egypt, Mexico, and Indonesia are already using them.
In the past, the USDA has licensed a handful of bird flu vaccines, though none of them are approved for the current strain, according to the American Medical Veterinary Association. Still, the USDA hasn&rsquo;t approved them for actual use in mass vaccination campaigns on farms, Torrella writes, due to something called the &ldquo;DIVA problem&rdquo;:
> DIVA is short for &ldquo;differentiating infected from vaccinated animals&rdquo; &mdash; the challenge of identifying whether a bird is actually infected with avian influenza, or just has avian influenza antibodies after vaccination. Countries fear that importing eggs or slaughtered meat from vaccinated birds in countries where the virus is circulating could inadvertently spread it within their own borders by introducing the virus to wild or domesticated animals through discarded raw meat.
> That means that big poultry exporters like the US &mdash; which sends&nbsp;18 percent&nbsp;of its poultry abroad &mdash; don&rsquo;t vaccinate, for fear they&rsquo;ll miss out on a huge part of their revenue: international trade.
That said, the USDA began testing several potential bird flu vaccines in April to see how well they might respond to the current strain of influenza virus. Vaccines could be commercially available within 18 to 24 months, the agency said in April. Several other countries are also testing influenza vaccines for birds.
Separately, USDA has approved the emergency use of a bird flu vaccine for the critically endangered California condors &ldquo;in an attempt to prevent additional deaths of these birds.&rdquo; Veterinary officials will start vaccine trials for condors later this month, according to Joanna Gilkeson, a spokesperson for the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
How can I help?
If you have pets, prevent them from interacting with infected birds. That means keeping your cat indoors and your dog on a leash.
You can also help monitor the outbreak, especially if you already spend a lot of time outdoors looking for wildlife. Birders are &ldquo;the eyes and ears of this panzootic,&rdquo; Nichola Hill, an infectious disease ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston, told Vox earlier this year. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re being harnessed enough.&rdquo;
While people are used to photographing beautiful wildlife on their phones and uploading it to platforms like&nbsp;iNaturalist, right now it&rsquo;s more important that they document dead birds, she said. (iNaturalist actually&nbsp;has a webpage&nbsp;exactly for this purpose.) If you find a dead wild bird and are not sure what to do, check out&nbsp;this one-pager&nbsp;from the USDA.

Scientists Raise Alarm as More Cats Die from Avian Flu,1690329600000,"A cat shelter in South Korea has been put under quarantine after two of the felines tested positive for H5N1 bird flu in the capital city of Seoul.
The South Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement on Tuesday that this was the first time that this bird flu had been detected in cats in the country since 2016, as reported by Reuters.
The positive-testing cats were two of 38 cats that had recently died at the same shelter. Workers at the shelter are being monitored, although none are exhibiting symptoms of the condition.
H5N1 bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a highly infectious viral disease that usually spreads between birds, but can also jump species to mammals, and occasionally, humans. Cases of the H5N1 strain of the virus have seen a worldwide outbreak since 2021, being detected in birds around the globe.
Avian influenza comes in both ""low pathogenic"" and ""highly pathogenic"" forms, with low pathogenic strains only causing minor symptoms in birds, and highly pathogenic strains posing a greater threat.
Nearly 59 million poultry birds across the country have been affected by the outbreak, with around 7,000 wild birds testing positive for H5N1, according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data.
The South Korean deaths come only days after 34 cats in Poland were found to have been infected by the virus, many of which showed neurological symptoms like paralysis, with some later dying.
""This virus needs to be taken seriously,"" Wendla Beyer, policy coordinator for international animal welfare nonprofit Four Paws, said in a statement on July 17 regarding the Polish cat outbreak. ""Following on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw the largest avian influenza outbreak worldwide, with devastating effects on animals, trade and the livelihoods of farmers. Infections in mammals spark fears of viral mutations that could become transmissible between humans, igniting a new pandemic. And now, as we have seen, house cats are dying from the virus.""
Other cases of mammals being infected by the virus include grizzly bears, foxes, skunks and raccoons, and a variety of domestic mammals like dogs, cats, pigs and horses.
Only one person has tested positive for the infection in the U.S., which occurred in April this year in someone directly involved with culling poultry infected with the virus. The virus has been circulating for several decades, however, infecting over 700 people since 2003. Around half of the people infected died from the virus.
There is a very low risk of humans being infected by H5N1, both from birds and other humans, due to the low success of the virus spreading between people, according to the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO). No cases of a person catching the virus from cats has ever been recorded, with most cases stemming from working in close contact with poultry.
There is concern that the virus may mutate into a strain more infectious to humans, which would be a major worldwide issue.
""The global H5N1 situation is worrying given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including in humans,"" Sylvie Briand, a WHO official, said on February 24. ""WHO takes the risk from this virus seriously and urges heightened vigilance from all countries.""

Bird Flu Spreads Rapidly Across South America Killing Scores of Sea Lions,1693440000000,"Large numbers of sea lions have been found dead along the Argentinian coast as a result of avian influenza, or bird flu.
This most recent influx of dead sea lions marks another swath of marine mammals dying from the viral infection across South America. The Patagonian environmental authority said in a statement that 50 sea lions have been found dead so far with symptoms matching bird flu.
Earlier this month, around other 20 sea lions died off the coast of Tierra del Fuego, at the southernmost tip of Argentina, seven of which tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus. Positive cases of H5N1 bird flu have been detected across the country's coast, including in Buenos Aries, Rio Negro and Mar del Plata, according to the Argentinian National Agri-Food Health and Quality Service (Senasa).
H5N1 bird flu is a highly infectious strain of influenza virus that usually infects birds. The H5N1 strain initially emerged in 1996 from geese in China. The virus can also jump to mammals—including humans—and cases of the infection in both birds and mammals have soared since 2021 when a worldwide outbreak began.
In March alone, 3,487 sea lions were reported dead in Peru by the country's national parks service, many of which were as a result of the H5N1 virus. It is thought that over 20,000 mammals from over 15 species have died as a result of the virus across Peru and Chile since the outbreak began.
""This outbreak in sea lions began in Peru, then it passed to Chile and now it's reaching Argentina,"" Pablo Plaza, a biologist and researcher at CONICET, the main organization dedicated to promoting scientific research in Argentina, told Spanish newspaper El Pais.
""There are two hypotheses here: Either they were infected because they were in contact with infected birds—which is the most likely [scenario]—or the virus, in some way, underwent a mutation and is now being transmitted from sea lion to sea lion.""
Other mammal species that have been reported to have been infected by the virus include grizzly bears, as well as a recent outbreak in cats in Poland. Nearly 59 million poultry birds across 47 U.S. states have been affected by the outbreak, according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data, with around 7,000 wild birds testing positive for the virus.
The infection has been spreading in marine mammals along the South American coast in recent months, sparking fears that it may eventually reach Antarctica, especially with the seasonal migration of infected birds.
Only one person has tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu in the United States, with that individual having been directly involved with culling poultry infected with the virus. World Health Organization (WHO) data shows that 8 people have been infected since 2021 worldwide.
The virus has circulated for several decades, infecting over 700 people since 2003. Around half of the people infected died from the virus.
The risk of the virus being spread between humans appears to be very low, though there are fears that it may mutate to be more effective at transmission between mammals.
""With the information available so far, the virus does not appear to be able to transmit from one person to another easily, but vigilance is needed to identify any evolution in the virus that can change that,"" Sylvie Briand, the director of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention at WHO, said in a statement in July.
""WHO is working closely with [the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations] and [World Organization for Animal Health], and laboratory networks to monitor the evolution of these viruses, looking for signals of any change that could be more dangerous to humans. We encourage all countries to increase their ability to monitor these viruses and to detect any human cases. This is especially important as the virus is now affecting countries with limited prior experience in avian flu surveillance.""
Argentina's Senasa urges those who encounter a dead marine mammal or bird to steer well clear, avoiding contact and keeping pets away. They warn against touching surfaces that the birds or sea lions may have touched and left secretions upon and encourage people to contact Senasa if they come across a sick or dead animal suspected to be infected. These animals will then be buried by the authorities to avoid them infecting further animals or humans.

Virulent strain of avian flu detected in seals in Antarctic region,1704844800000,"H5N1 cases in South Georgia increase concerns about virus’ ability to adapt and infect mammals and humans more easily

The Antarctic seal is the latest species to be hit by a virulent strain of avian flu as the virus jumps from birds to wild animals around the world, increasing concerns it will adapt to infect mammals and humans more easily.

The UK’ Animal and Plant Health Agency said on Thursday that its experts had detected avian flu in seals and other animals on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia, which scientists concluded was most likely introduced by birds migrating from South America.

The spread to mammals of the virulent H5N1 strain, which was first detected in poultry and wild birds in the spring of 2021, has raised concerns that the virus will begin to adapt to mammals, boosting its zoonotic potential to spread to humans.

“iven Antarctica is such a unique and special biodiversity hotspot, it is sad and concerning to see the disease spread to mammals in the region,” aid Prof Ian Brown, APHA’ director of scientific services.

Ashley Banyard, an avian flu expert at APHA, said the team had found no evidence of adaptation among seals on South Georgia, indicating that the virus was not transmitted from seal to seal, but rather from birds scavenged by them or through their exposure to bird excrement.

However, scientists have found signs of adaptation in mammals in other parts of the world. For example, scientists found evidence of mammalian adaptation following a severe outbreak among seals on the New England coast of the US in June 2022. Adaptation was also identified in sealions in Chile.

South America has been badly hit by the virus in recent months, leading to thousands of deaths of marine mammals in Peru, Brazil and Chile. Its spread to the Atlantic Convergence —he marine belt encircling Antarctica —ill be a further cause of concern for epidemiologists.

“t’ a numbers game,”aid Banyard. “t the start of an outbreak you might not see adaptation in mammals, but if there is continued exposure there may be adaptation.”

In July last year the World Health Organization warned that the “larming rise in mammalian cases”f bird flu posed an increased zoonotic risk as it meant the virus could adapt to infect humans more easily. While the incidence of avian flu in humans is low, fatality rates are high.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 19 human cases had been detected worldwide from January 2022 to the end of December 2023, with nine severe cases leading to five deaths. Almost all of the patients had been infected through contact with diseased poultry and there was no evidence of the virus spreading between people.

The virus was first detected in the sub-Antarctic region in October last year following the deaths of several skuas, predatory seabirds. During a three-week expedition, an APHA virology team detected the virus in elephant seals and fur seals, as well as in birds including brown skuas, kelp gulls and Antarctic terns.

However avian flu has caused less infection among captive and wild birds across the northern hemisphere over the past three months than it did during the autumns of 2021 and 2022.

Bird flu strain raises alarm as virus kills South American wildlife,1710288000000,"SAO PAULO, March 13(Reuters) - The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus has spread more aggressively than ever before in wild birds and marine mammals since arriving in South America in 2022, raising the risk of it evolving into a bigger threat to humans, according to interviews with eight scientists. Of more immediate concern is evidence the disease, once largely confined to bird species, appears to be spreading between mammals. This strain has already killed a handful of dolphins in Chile and Peru, some 50,000 seals and sea lions along the coasts, and at least half a million birds regionwide. To confirm mammal-to-mammal transmission, scientists would likely need to test infections in live animals. ""It's almost certainly happened,"" said Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. ""It's pretty hard to explain some of these large infections and die off without having mammal-to-mammal spread."" The strain has shown up in dozens of bird species, including some migrating species, which can spread it beyond the region, scientists told Reuters. As climate change escalates, animals will be forced to move into new territories, mixing with one another in new ways and possibly boosting opportunities for the virus to further mutate. ""It's a matter of time before you will detect the first South American strain in North America,"" said Alonzo Alfaro-Nunez, a viral ecologist at University of Copenhagen. HUMAN RISK The growing concern has prompted the 35 countries in the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to convene regional health experts and officials at a meeting this week in Rio de Janeiro. The group plans to launch the world's first regional commission to oversee bird flu monitoring and response efforts, a PAHO official told Reuters. This has not been previously reported. Since the virus was first detected in Colombia in October 2022, there have been two known cases in humans on the continent, one each in Ecuador and Chile. Both came from exposure to infected birds. While those patients survived, H5N1 bird flu is deadly to humans in roughly 60% of cases worldwide. The World Health Organization is unlikely to raise the risk level for humans from the current ""low"" without evidence of human-to-human transmission or mutations adapted to human receptors, experts said. Drugmakers, including GSK and Moderna, have said they are developing bird flu vaccines for humans, and have the capacity to produce hundreds of million so doses within months utilizing production lines used for seasonal flu vaccines. ""We're seeing (the virus) doing little evolutionary steps that are on the long-term moving towards a potential human infection,"" said Ralph Vanstreels, a University of California, Davis researcher studying South American variants of H5N1. Every year, Argentina's Peninsula Valdes on the windswept Atlantic coast teems with densely packed elephant seals rearing pups. Last November, Vanstreels came across a grim scene: hundreds of dead and rotting pups on the beach. Researchers estimate 17,400 pups died, nearly all born to the colony that year. For each of those pups to have been infected by birds is highly unlikely, scientists said. Pups usually have contact only with their mothers, leading scientists to suspect this is how it spread. Vanstreels is part of a group of scientists working to trace the virus' genetic mutations in South America. In a draft paper posted on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, they analyzed samples from sea lions, seals and birds from up the coast from Peninsula Valdes. Comparing the genomes from these samples with those collected in North America in 2022 and Asia earlier, the team identified nine new mutations. The same mutations were found in samples collected in 2022 and 2023 in Chile and Peru, which were also hit by mass mortality of sea lions and birds. ""This is the first time this virus is so adapted to wildlife,"" Vanstreels said. ""Clearly something happened in Peru and in northern Chile where they acquired these new mutations."" In the draft paper, researchers noted that the same mutations were present in one of the continent's two human cases, a 53-year-old man who lived one block from the seashore where seabirds congregated. Researchers said that case ""highlights the potential threat posed by these viruses to public health."" REGIONAL RESPONSE With health officials and experts meeting in Rio this week, Latin American countries will be pressed to boost disease surveillance in the wild. The region's patchy data and limited resources has left scientists struggling to understand how the disease is spreading in the wild, with the number of cases likely much higher than reported. Some cases are not being sampled or lab-tested, scientists said. Bolivia, for example, did not register a case in the wild last year, though the disease has been detected in surrounding countries, said Manuel Jose Sanchez Vazquez, epidemiology coordinator for PAHO's veterinary health center. Managing the disease response can also be complex, Sanchez noted. Threats to humans are dealt with by public health officials, while threats to poultry or livestock fall to agriculture or veterinary authorities. In wild animals, the purview typically falls to environmental officials. The new regional commission, expected to be announced on Thursday, would aim to set standard protocols for monitoring, handling and reporting cases among various government agencies. It could also help in pooling laboratory resources, Sanchez said. ""We are worried and we are vigilant,"" Sanchez said. ""The more adaptation of the virus to mammals, the more likely it is that transmission to humans could happen.""",Reuters,yes,no,The article reports a human mortality rate of roughly 60% for H5N1 bird flu cases worldwide but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.,It's almost certainly happened.,Richard Webby,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0,7,2,8,3,4,5,6,8,2,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,11.3,11.8,0.0909195402,0.1092758621,0.0820229885,0.2210344828,0.0656551724,0.5225862069,0.3231034483,0.1286091954,0.0402298851,0.1079425287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5315,0.0,0.5315,0.426,0.0,0.426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,It's pretty hard to explain some of these large infections and die off without having mammal-to-mammal spread.,Richard Webby,It's a matter of time before you will detect the first South American strain in North America.,Alonzo Alfaro-Nunez,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,0.138,0.0,0.2553333333,0.1563333333,0.513,0.5493333333,0.2576666667,0.0,0.255,0.0,0.258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4805,0.0,0.0,0.2225,We're seeing (the virus) doing little evolutionary steps that are on the long-term moving towards a potential human infection.,Ralph Vanstreels,This is the first time this virus is so adapted to wildlife.,Ralph Vanstreels,Clearly something happened in Peru and in northern Chile where they acquired these new mutations.,Ralph Vanstreels,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3125,0.0,0.46,0.0,0.1475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.258,0.0,0.3515,0.0,0.3515,0.258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jake Spring,907.0,reuters_clean.xlsx,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,reuters,Center
"Human Contracts Bird Flu After Cases in Cattle, Goats: Officials",1711929600000,"The person came into contact with sick animals.

Avian influenza has been detected in a person in the United States, officials said on April 1.
The person became ill after coming into contact with cows that are likely sick with the influenza, also known as the bird flu, the Texas Department of State Health Services said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that its testing confirmed that the person has highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1).
The first human case domestically was confirmed in Colorado in 2022. That man recovered after experiencing fatigue.
Worldwide, hundreds of cases, as well as hundreds of deaths, have been recorded since 2003, according to the World Health Organization.
“This infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low,” the CDC said in a statement. “However, people with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.”
According to officials, the new patient’s main symptom was conjunctivitis, or pink eye.
The CDC said over the weekend that people who are exposed to confirmed or probable avian influenza cases should monitor themselves daily for 10 days and report any new respiratory symptoms or heightened temperatures. The incubation period is generally three to five days, but can be as long as 10 days, according to the agency.
The human case comes after cows in five states, including Texas, tested positive for the influenza.
Tests came back positive from New Mexico, Idaho, and Michigan, the Department of Agriculture said on March 29. Cows in Texas and Kansas previously tested positive for the illness, officials announced on March 25.
The cows in Idaho and Michigan came from Texas. The cattle did not appear sick when they were picked up from Texas and moved to Michigan, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.
Federal and state officials have been investigating the cases, which have been found among mostly older cows exhibiting symptoms such as decreased milk production and a diminished appetite. The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration are assisting.
Because the affected cows in Idaho came from another state that has identified influenza cases in cattle, the cases in Idaho may have been transmitted by cows, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture said.
The flu has been detected in birds before, and dead wild birds were found at the farms that reported the initial cases, the Department of Agriculture said. As of now, birds “are believed to be the source” of the infections, the agency said. But the spread of the illness among Michigan cattle, it said, indicates that transmission between cattle “cannot be ruled out.”
Farmers are being encouraged to quickly report illnesses among their cattle to veterinarians, particularly if cattle experience symptoms associated with the influenza.
“Dairies are required to send only milk from healthy animals into processing for human consumption; milk from impacted animals is being diverted or destroyed so that it does not enter the human food supply,” the Department of Agriculture stated.
“In addition, pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk. Pasteurization is required for any milk entering interstate commerce for human consumption.”
The Food and Drug Administration said the cases are a reminder that it can be harmful to ingest raw milk, which is favored by some people who believe that there are health benefits to drinking unpasteurized milk.
“This outbreak has quickly grabbed the attention of the agriculture industry on a national level. Understanding the details surrounding the transfer of avian virus to livestock is the top priority of animal health professionals and agriculture agencies,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement.
“While troubling, this outbreak is not currently expected to threaten our nation’s commercial dairy supply.”
The bird flu is affecting about 10 percent of each affected herd, and there has been “little to no associated mortality” so far, according to federal officials.
“Milk loss resulting from symptomatic cattle to date is too limited to have a major impact on supply, and there should be no impact on the price of milk or other dairy products,” the Department of Agriculture stated.
“Further, the U.S. typically has a more than sufficient milk supply in the spring months due to seasonally higher production.”",EpochTimes,yes,no,"The article mentions 'hundreds of cases, as well as hundreds of deaths' worldwide since 2003, indicating a high human mortality rate related to bird flu.","This infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low.

"Rare Human Case of Bird Flu Reported in Texas: The unidentified person came down with symptoms following close contact with infected dairy cows, according to state officials:   The unidentified person came down with symptoms following close contact with infected dairy cows, according to state officials.",1711929600000,"A person in Texas has been diagnosed with a rare case of bird flu, marking the second known human infection ever in the United States, officials announced Monday. The unidentified patient came down with the highly pathogenic avian influenza A, also called H5N1, after coming into contact with dairy cattle “presumed to be infected” with the virus, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). “Avian influenza A viruses have only rarely been transmitted from person to person,” the DSHS announcement said. “As such, the risk to the general public is believed to be low; however, people with close contact with affected animals suspected of having avian influenza A have a higher risk of infection.” The only other U.S. case of bird flu seen in a person occurred in 2022. The Texas patient reported conjunctivitis-like eye redness as their only symptom “and is recovering” after being treated with antiviral drugs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Human illnesses from bird flu “have ranged from mild (e.g., eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms) to severe illness (e.g., pneumonia) that have resulted in death in other countries,” the CDC said on Monday. Between 2003 and 2023, 248 people were infected with H5N1, resulting in 139 fatalities, according to the World Health Organization. Other symptoms of H5N1 infection may include: fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and seizures. Cases among dairy cows were first detected last week in Texas, Kansas, and Michigan, according to the USDA, which said “presumptive positive test results” have also been found in herds in New Mexico and Idaho. The H5N1 virus first emerged in 1996, in Chinese geese. The following year, H5N1 was first seen in humans, in Hong Kong. In 2020, a highly contagious form of the virus spread throughout Europe and the rest of the world, including chickens farmed in the U.S. Texas officials say people should avoid raw milk, and consume only milk sold in stores, which is required to be pasteurized and is safe to drink. Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said last week that “[n]o contaminated milk is known to have entered the food chain; it has all been dumped. In the rare event that some affected milk enters the food chain, the pasteurization process will kill the virus.” Cattle infected by H5N1 are said to “exhibit flu-like symptoms including fever and thick and discolored milk accompanied by a sharp reduction in milk production averaging between 10-30 pounds per cow throughout the herd.” Monday’s DSHS bulletin was issued so health-care providers would be “vigilant for people with signs and symptoms” of H5N1, with a special focus on those who have had close contact with infected animals (within six feet) or who have consumed unpasteurized milk from dairy farms where suspected cases have occurred. “Although this is an evolving situation, the risk to the general public is low,” the agency said. “People can protect themselves against flu by washing their hands often, covering their coughs and sneezes, not picking up dead birds and animals, and staying home if sick.”",The Daily Beast,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate of 139 fatalities out of 248 infections, which is approximately 56%.

Texas person diagnosed with bird flu after exposure to cow,1712016000000,"A person in Texas has tested positive for bird flu after encountering a potentially infected dairy cow, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday. The federal health agency said the patient had experienced only one symptom — eye redness ""consistent with conjunctivitis"" — and was recovering. ""The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with an antiviral drug for flu,"" the CDC said. ""This infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low."" The report comes one week after the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed a bird flu outbreak among dairy cows in Texas and Kansas. The USDA discovered the disease in a Michigan dairy herd recently enlarged with cows from Texas. The infection reported Monday is the second known human case in the United States, following a 2022 illness in Colorado caused by exposure to infected poultry. Also known as avian flu, bird flu is a rare type A influenza virus commonly spread by wild birds. Health officials first identified it during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. Exhibiting symptoms similar to those of the common cold, it is fatal to poultry and can kill human beings if left untreated after two days. The CDC said there is no danger of the recent infection spreading through the commercial milk supply due to the pasteurization that dairy products undergo before hitting stories. However, the agency also released interim recommendations urging Americans to ""avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cattle), as well as with animal carcasses, raw milk, feces (poop), litter, or materials contaminated by birds or other animals"" suspected of infection. ""People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or related uncooked food products, such as unpasteurized (raw) milk, or products made from raw milk such as cheeses, from animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI A(H5N1)-virus infection (avian influenza or bird flu),"" the CDC said.

Bird flu in cows — and now in milk. How worried should we be?,1712016000000,"Bird flu is, famously, a disease that infects birds. Yet in recent months, it&rsquo;s been spreading to all kinds of other animals &mdash;&nbsp;including dairy cows. In the last month, government officials detected avian influenza in more than 30 herds across eight US states, raising concerns about the safety of cow&rsquo;s milk and the potential for the virus spreading in humans.
Federal regulations say that any milk from sick cows must be tossed before it reaches the grocery store. But on Tuesday, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it detected evidence of avian influenza in commercial, pasteurized milk,&nbsp;suggesting bird flu has infiltrated the dairy supply.
This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;ll get sick from your morning cereal. Here&rsquo;s what to know about your risk.
---
What you’ll learn
* Why it’s spreading from birds to cows
* Whether it’s safe to drink milk
* If humans can get sick from bird flu
* Where bird flu comes from
---
Does this mean milk is unsafe?
The short answer is that there&rsquo;s still uncertainty, but it is unlikely that you&rsquo;ll get sick from drinking store-bought, pasteurized cow milk. The FDA and other government agencies said Wednesday that the pasteurization process should render the virus harmless in commercial milk, though officials still have more testing to do. &ldquo;Our commercial milk supply is safe,&rdquo; Donald Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA, said on a press call Wednesday. Independent experts tend to agree.
Still, the news raises concerns about what risk bird flu will ultimately pose to humans, especially given the recent detection of influenza in a Texas farmworker. The patient &mdash;&nbsp;who was recovering swiftly after infection, sustaining only eye inflammation &mdash; was the second person in the US to contract avian influenza. If these people can catch avian flu, what risk does everyone else face?
Since the initial outbreaks on poultry farms in 2023,&nbsp;which sent the price of eggs soaring, bird flu has flared up only sporadically among farmed birds. Yet the virus has continued to spread &mdash;&nbsp;to different places and to different kinds of animals, including both wild and domestic mammals.
Early in 2023, the virus killed thousands of sea lions. This spring, meanwhile, officials found bird flu in Minnesota goats and among 33 dairy cattle herds in eight states (bird flu has likely been spreading among cattle for weeks or months before it was detected).
&ldquo;Although we don&rsquo;t yet completely understand the factors that led to infection of the dairy cows with HPAI, it is possible that unique viral properties combined with epidemiological and environmental conditions all played a role for the spillover of HPAI into cattle,&rdquo; said Diego Diel, an associate professor at Cornell University&rsquo;s college of veterinary medicine.
What makes cow-borne bird flu troubling&nbsp;is the obvious fact that humans, too, are mammals. As the virus makes the jump from birds to cows and other mammals, what&rsquo;s stopping it from jumping to all of us?
In the last few years, a couple dozen people worldwide &mdash;&nbsp;mostly in parts of Asia &mdash;&nbsp;have tested positive for this kind of bird flu, all of which likely came into close contact with infected animals. Symptoms may be nonexistent or subtle, such as eye redness or a mild flu, or they may show up as a fever (above 100 degrees Fahrenheit) and pneumonia and can prove fatal. In the last two decades, more than 800 people have been infected with bird flu globally, and more than half of them died.
In the US, however, human infections &mdash;&nbsp;let alone deaths &mdash;&nbsp;are rare. The first human case of avian influenza from the current outbreak was in 2022, when a Colorado farmer who was involved in killing chickens tested positive. The man said he was tired for a few days but quickly recovered. The person in Texas, meanwhile, tested positive earlier this year, after he was exposed to dairy cattle that were &ldquo;presumed to be infected&rdquo; with highly pathogenic bird flu, per the CDC. The patient is taking an antiviral medication and recovering, the agency said.
As for the rest of us?
First, the good news: The bird flu that infected the farmworker earlier this month in Texas is almost certainly incapable of spreading dangerous infections to other people around the planet, experts say. Simply put, the virus currently does not have the proper biological&nbsp;machinery to easily invade &mdash; let alone circulate among &mdash; humans. We have very different physiologies than birds and other animals that HPAI readily infects. These workers got sick because they were likely exposed to very high levels of virus. (If you want to go deeper, check out our earlier explainer on this.)
The bottom line: The chances of you getting bird flu anytime soon are extremely slim.
Bird flu will continue to evolve
That said, influenza viruses evolve quickly and unpredictably. Not only do they mutate, but they can also swap entire portions of their genomes with other viruses if two or more of them infect the same host at one time. Under the right circumstances, these changes could give the virus the tools to replicate more easily in mammals, which could make future strains of bird flu more threatening to humans.
Scientists are now racing to figure out what, exactly, those circumstances might be. More specifically, they&rsquo;re looking for signs that the virus is picking up adaptations that make it more likely to replicate within mammalian cells and &mdash;&nbsp;critically &mdash;&nbsp;to spread from mammal to mammal, such as cow to cow or seal to seal. &ldquo;There are many unanswered questions about the current HPAI outbreak in cattle, but one of the key questions is whether the virus is being transmitted from cow to cow,&rdquo; Diel said.
A recent study suggests that the virus has adapted to marine mammals and may be able to spread among them. The virus also appears capable of spreading among cows within the same herd, Mike Watson, who leads the US Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said on a call with reporters this week. Still, Watson said, &ldquo;we have not found changes in the virus that will make it more transmissible to humans.&rdquo;
Obviously it&rsquo;s not great that another human tested positive for bird flu, or that the virus is showing up in commercial milk. But we&rsquo;re not on the cusp of (or even close to) another pandemic.
This story, however, is not yet over. Scientists are still trying to figure out how the virus is changing and what it means that cows are getting sick. The virus could evolve to become a risk &mdash;&nbsp;especially to farm workers and people who work with wild animals &mdash; underscoring the importance of monitoring the outbreak closely.
How did this all start?
Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a general term for the&nbsp;disease caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect and spread among poultry and some wild birds. They&rsquo;re distinct from viruses that cause the flu in humans, though they&rsquo;re related.
These avian viruses are quite common in the wild. They&rsquo;ve been circulating for eons among waterfowl, such as ducks and geese, without causing them much harm. Mild forms of infection are called &ldquo;low-pathogenic avian influenza,&rdquo; or LPAI, which means they&rsquo;re typically not deadly to wildlife.
The type of avian influenza spreading today is different.
Occasionally, a low-pathogenic virus can jump from wild birds to birds on poultry farms. As the virus replicates in densely packed warehouses of farmed birds, it can quickly evolve and adapt in ways that make it highly deadly to poultry. At that point, it gets dubbed a &ldquo;highly pathogenic avian influenza virus,&rdquo; or HPAI virus. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s circulating today &mdash; an HPAI virus. The specific version of the virus is called H5N1.
Highly pathogenic bird flu has caused outbreaks on poultry farms many times in the past that have killed thousands to millions of farm birds. But what makes this particular form of avian influenza virus so unusual is that it easily spreads and causes severe disease among wild birds and an increasing number of mammals. That&rsquo;s rare, leading some experts to say that we&rsquo;re in a new era of bird flu.

The strain of avian influenza currently spreading descended from a virus that caused an outbreak on a goose farm in Guangdong,&nbsp;China, in 1996. The US first experienced one of these goose farm virus outbreaks in 2014 and 2015, which caused the death and culling of tens of millions of poultry birds and an unknown number of wild birds. Then in 2021, a related version of the virus arrived in the US &mdash;&nbsp;the cause of the current outbreak &mdash; that appears much better equipped at infecting wild animals.
Bird flu became big news in the months that followed, in 2022, when it started spreading through poultry farms. Farmers were forced to cull tens of millions of turkeys and egg-laying hens, often using a gruesome approach. It cost the federal government and the poultry industry hundreds of millions of dollars to manage and sent&nbsp;egg prices soaring&nbsp;in late 2022 and early this year.
As the virus continues to spread to poultry flocks and dairy cow herds, it raises complex questions about our food system, and how we can make it healthier for humans &mdash; not to mention farmed animals and wildlife. Industrial animal agriculture, with thousands of animals packed together in warehouses, is a breeding ground for bird flu. So, even if this current outbreak among birds wanes, we&rsquo;ll likely continue to see new outbreaks in the decades to come, across different species. Eventually, that could pose a more serious risk to humans; the more chances bird flu gets to evolve, the more opportunities it has to turn into something dangerous.
To prevent or slow the spread of zoonotic diseases, like bird flu and Covid-19, governments, food companies, and farmers will need to invest heavily in surveillance (including of wild birds) and even vaccines, and they may ultimately need to make much more serious changes to animal agriculture.

"Lack of immunity raises risk of bird flu pandemic, EFSA says",1712102400000,"PARIS, April 3 (Reuters) - The EU's Food Safety Agency (EFSA) warned on Wednesday of a large-scale bird flu pandemic if the virus becomes transmissible between people as humans lack immunity against the virus. This comes a day after Texas reported that the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, had been detected in a person who had contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected with the virus. The spread of bird flu is a concern for governments and the poultry industry due to the devastation it can cause to flocks, and a risk of human transmission. The number of bird flu outbreaks has been lower so far this season but it spread geographically, including to Antarctica, and to an increasing number of mammals, raising the risk of it evolving into a bigger threat to humans. To date there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission observed and bird flu transmission from infected animals to humans is rare. However, these viruses continue to evolve globally, and with the migration of wild birds, new strains carrying potential mutations for mammalian adaptation could be selected, EFSA said. ""If avian A(H5N1) influenza viruses acquire the ability to spread efficiently among humans, large‐scale transmission could occur due to the lack of immune defences against H5 viruses in humans,"" EFSA said in a report. Some 887 cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza, were reported globally between January 2003 and Feb. 26 this year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said in its latest report. Of these 462 were fatal, accounting for a rate of 52%. The majority of human cases were detected in people with unprotected exposure to sick or dead poultry, live poultry markets or a contaminated environment. Wild mammals could act as bridge hosts between wild birds, domestic animals and humans, EFSA said. Companion animals, such as cats living in households and with access to the outdoors, could also be a potential vehicle for transmission, it added. In addition to poultry and dairy cows reported in the United States, mammals hit by the virus include goats, cats, foxes, racoons, skunks, polar and grizzly bears and elephant seals. EFSA called for enhanced surveillance for humans and animals, ensuring access to rapid diagnostics, promoting collaboration between the animal and human sectors and implementing preventive measures such as vaccination.",Reuters,yes,no,The article reports a human mortality rate of 52% for H5N1 avian influenza but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.,"If avian A(H5N1) influenza viruses acquire the ability to spread efficiently among humans, large‐scale transmission could occur due to the lack of immune defences against H5 viruses in humans.",EFSA,0.0,3.0,2.0,7.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,5,2,7,4,3,4,6,7,2,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,13.9,15.79,0.0848823529,0.0629411765,0.0372352941,0.2693235294,0.0747647059,0.5066470588,0.3144117647,0.1152058824,0.0960588235,0.0806470588,0.0,0.1926666667,0.0,0.5336666667,0.0,0.7836666667,0.1926666667,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sybille de La Hamaide,387.0,reuters_clean.xlsx,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,reuters,Center
Human and Cattle Infected With Bird Flu Puts Scientists on Alert,1712275200000,"With the second human bird flu case in the United States in the past two years and the COVID-19 pandemic still fresh in the public’s memory, concern is rising over the potential for avian influenza to be a public health problem in America.
Bird flu, a longtime pest for the world’s poultry industry, is now crossing over to other animals, including livestock and humans. In March and April, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported bird flu detections in dairy herds in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, and Texas. That followed news of a goat in Minnesota contracting the disease in March.
For now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the risk to Americans is negligible and isolated almost exclusively to people who work with live birds or animals.
“This infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low,” Jason McDonald, a spokesman for the CDC, told The Epoch Times in an email.
The disease, classified into the categories of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI), has caused sporadic issues with poultry farming for decades.
However, veterinarians have recognized a marked increase in the spread of bird flu and its effects in the past 30 years.
Then, the authors recognized “major human health issues, including the risk of generating a new pandemic virus for humans through an avian-human link.”
Bird flu can infect any species of bird. The typical response on farms is to kill the animals, destroy their remains, and isolate the facilities and their staff to prevent the further spread of the disease.
Both the CDC and the WOAH say there is some risk of transmission from live birds to humans but only for people working or living closely with animals. Both public health organizations say there is no evidence that bird flu can be transmitted to consumers through cooked poultry products.
Mr. Swayne, now a private consultant with Birdflu Veterinarian LLC, wrote in 2023 that between 2003 and February 2023, 873 people were infected with H5N1 HPAI. Most of them were located in Asia and Africa. A total of 458 people died from the infection.
“Respiratory infection has been the most frequent clinical sign in human H5 cases,” he wrote. “This virus has limited human-to-human transmission.”
Other strains of bird flu have been fatal, too.
In China, the strain H7N9 infected 1,568 people and killed 616 of them between 2013 and February 2023. In the Netherlands, 89 people were infected with the H7N7 strain in 2003, and one died.
The announcement followed weeks of surprising news about HPAI detections in livestock across the United States.
“Initial testing by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories has not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans, which would indicate that the current risk to the public remains low,” APHIS said in a March 25 statement.
“At this stage, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health.”
In an interview with The Epoch Times, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said the man who contracted HPAI only had one symptom: conjunctivitis, or pink eye. As for the cows, he said, they quickly recovered from the infection.
Mr. Miller told The Epoch Times that the human infection is nothing for the public to worry about. If it came to it, he said, the CDC already has a stockpile of human vaccines ready to go if HPAI were to begin spreading among people.
Nevertheless, he said authorities in Texas are not sure whether the man contracted HPAI directly from the cow—meaning the avian disease is now moving from one mammal to another—or if the man got the disease from contact with birds or their droppings. The agriculture commissioner said migratory bird season recently ended in Texas so those droppings could have infected both the cow and the man.
At this point, Mr. Miller said, there are still a lot of unanswered questions.
“We’re worried about it, but we’re not panicked,” he said.
In an interview with The Epoch Times, Bryan Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center, said this human case of HPAI is significantly different from the last case. In 2022, a man in Colorado contracted HPAI while working on removing dead birds from a poultry facility in which the disease was present.
As for other cases, those in subsistence farms in undeveloped countries and hobby farms in developed nations, the people who got the disease were practically living with poultry or waterfowl in their homes. In the past, Mr. Richards said, human-to-human transmission hasn’t happened.
“It would take sustained human-to-human transmission in order for it to turn into any sort of a global threat to people,” he told The Epoch Times.
That said, Mr. Richards said the virus is constantly mutating.
In a March 19 report, the WAHIS highlighted the rise of mammalian cases of bird flu in 2024.
“WOAH stresses the importance of reporting outbreaks of avian influenza in unusual hosts, as the virus has been increasingly detected in mammals in recent months,” the WAHIS report reads.
In the four weeks from February 17 to March 15 covered by the report, the agency detected H5N1 in a striped skunk in the United States and a red fox in Norway.
Mr. Richards said transmission makes sense since the animals that are contracting HPAI are scavengers that likely ate a dead, infected bird. As for the South American pinnipeds, they could have eaten an infected bird—penguins are now contracting the disease—or gotten it from bird droppings. Birds carry HPAI and LPAI all over the world, and there have been detections as far south as southern Argentina.
Evidence collected by the federal health and agriculture authorities suggests that many of the cows that tested positive for HPAI around the country share a similar origin: Texas. If viral genetic sequencing tests show that all of the cows contracted a similar H5 HPAI virus, Mr. Richards said that would be “pretty compelling evidence” that cow-to-cow transmission of HPAI is now occurring.
Public health authorities continue to say HPAI cannot be transferred in cooked poultry products or pasteurized dairy.
Mr. Richards refused to say whether the evidence is alarming to him. He said he puts his trust in human and animal health authorities. So far, they aren’t alarmed, either.
HPAI particularly affects the birds that live the longest: egg-laying hens and turkeys. The United States has already seen two mass outbreaks of HPAI in its commercial poultry industry.
The U.S. outbreaks, running from 2014 to 2015 and again from 2022 to the present, devastated the American turkey and egg industries and sent prices of eggs and turkey meat soaring.
Mark Jordan, the executive director of LEAP Market Analytics, said the U.S. poultry industry is suffering from the “persistent, ongoing, and relentless” outbreak of HPAI and cannot go more than a few months without seeing another case.
Mr. Jordan, an economist specializing in the poultry industry, said the price of eggs and turkey dramatically increased in the past two years thanks to HPAI. This adds to the inflationary pressure American consumers are already feeling.
The average retail prices of eggs in the United States increased to $2.76 per dozen in the first quarter of 2024 from the pre-HPAI price of $1.67 a dozen in 2021, according to Mr. Jordan. That’s a 65 percent increase in the staple.
He said the turkey industry has suffered the most damage from the disease. Demand for the product was already lower than that of competing proteins, and a sudden price jump knocked it off many consumers’ shopping lists.
Mr. Jordan said HPAI pushed turkey prices up to a point where consumers turned away from the meat entirely. The average wholesale price of turkey meat actually dropped to $1.16 a pound in the first quarter of 2024 from the HPAI-driven price of $2.04 a pound in 2022.
The U.S. poultry industry’s attitude toward HPAI is now resigned, he said. It sees the disease as part of life and a constant threat to its operations.
For both egg producers and buyers, according to Mr. Jordan, HPAI is now being “priced in,” which could lead to price stability—although egg prices will remain higher than the pre-HPAI levels.

Europe Warns of ‘Lack of Immune Defenses’ Among Humans If Bird Flu Changes,1712275200000,"Avian influenza is spreading among cattle, chickens, and other animals.

Avian influenza could quickly spread among humans if it mutates further, European authorities are warning.
Monique Eloit, head of the World Organisation for Animal Health, also said this week that the spread of bird flu to an increasing number of species and its widening geographic reach has raised the risk of humans being infected by the virus.
“Over the last few months, we have had a whole series of diverse and varied mammals. It is worrying to see this extension to other species,” Ms. Eloit said. “Ultimately, we find ourselves with more and more species and more animals which are contaminated, therefore necessarily a higher viral load with a risk of contamination of humans.”
Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has led to the culling of hundreds of millions of poultry around the globe in past years, with the virus mostly carried by migrating wild birds. Although the number of outbreaks has been lower this season, the virus has spread to new regions, including South America and Antarctica, and has hit a larger number of animals.
Some outbreaks of bird flu have caused serious or fatal infections among people who have close contact with wild birds or poultry, but to date, there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission observed, according to scientists. Animal and human flu viruses tend to mutate, though, raising concern that one will turn into a virus that can be transmitted between mammals, including humans.
“I don’t think we are seeing evidence of human-to-human transmission at this time, and this particular 2.3.4.4b strain of virus H5N1 may cause less severe disease than other H5N1 viruses,” John Lowe, who holds a doctorate in medical science and is director of the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Global Center for Health Authority, told The Epoch Times via email.
“We should keep in mind, however, that we have only a small number of cases to guide our assumptions at this point, and overall, H5N1 viruses infections in humans historically have been severe, with a case fatality rate over 50 [percent].”
The case fatality rate is the proportion of people who contract an illness who die.
Between 2003 and March 25, 2024, 888 human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus, also known as H5N1 bird flu, have been reported to the World Health Organization from 23 countries. Of those patients, 463 died, the organization said.
The only human infection in the United States during that time happened in 2022, and that individual recovered.
The avian influenza viruses have primarily been spreading among birds around the world, but scores of cattle in the United States have recently begun testing positive for the H5N1 bird flu. Cattle have tested positive at eight farms in Texas, three farms in Kansas, two farms in New Mexico, one farm in Idaho, one farm in Michigan, and one farm in Ohio, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The agency emphasized that the mutation has been seen in the past but that there remains “no evidence of onward spread among people” and that it maintains the position that the risk from the influenza is low.
Mr. Lowe said that people should be concerned but not alarmed.
“Any time a new flu virus affects multiple species or a large number of animals, it creates potential for accelerated virus evolution that could produce a change in the virus to spread between people and we have little immune protection against. While the virus has a single mutation adapting to infecting mammals, we have not yet seen evidence of accelerated evolution for human-to-human transmission,” he said.
He said he was on the fence regarding whether people should be worried.
“It’s hard to say it’s something to worry about,” Mr. Richards said. “It’s hard to say it’s not something to worry about.”
For now, the primary risk is to people who work with animals, or live near them, authorities and other experts say.
Those people should wear protective equipment when six feet or closer to sick or dead animals, animal feces, or materials that may be contaminated with the avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC.
Those people should isolate and call a doctor immediately if they fall ill, Mr. Lowe said. He said the general public does not need to take protective measures against the flu as of now.",EpochTimes,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, citing a case fatality rate over 50% and 463 deaths out of 888 cases.

CDC Issues Health Alert for Bird Flu Infection Following Recent US Case,1712275200000,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a health alert following confirmation of a person becoming infected with avian influenza, also known as bird flu.
The CDC announced on April 1 that a dairy farm worker in Texas had been been diagnosed with the H5N1 bird flu, marking only the second national case of the virus infecting a person. The only other known U.S. case was diagnosed in a Colorado poultry worker in 2022.
On Friday, the CDC alert stressed the importance of informing ""clinicians, state health departments, and the public of a recently confirmed human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza,"" while pointing out that the infection had likely been acquired from dairy cows.
The alert recommends that those working with birds or livestock use personal protective equipment (PPE) to lower the risk of infection. PPE is also recommended when dealing with people who may have been exposed to the virus.
A CDC spokesperson told Newsweek via email on Friday night that the alert ""is intended to inform clinicians,"" while risks ""to the general public"" remain ""low.""
The alert urges health care workers to monitor patients ""showing signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness or conjunctivitis and who have relevant exposure history"" and suggests the isolation of those who may have contracted bird flu.
The lone symptom in the Texas patient was conjunctivitis, or inflammation of the eye. However, bird flu can also cause coughing, sore throat, fever, fatigue, shortness of breath and other serious symptoms. Over half of the over 900 human H5N1 cases reported globally since 1997 have resulted in death.
The CDC stressed the importance of those working with animals following recommendations that may reduce the chances of a future outbreak. The public was also urged to take common-sense measures to prevent infection, despite risks currently being low.
""People should avoid being near sick or dead animals or surfaces contaminated with the animal's feces, litter, raw milk, or other byproducts when not wearing respiratory or eye protection,"" the alert states.
""As always, people should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or related uncooked food products, such as unpasteurized (raw) milk or raw cheeses, from animals with suspected or confirmed [bird flu] infection,"" it continues.
While there have long been concerns about bird flu infections in people potentially sparking a new epidemic or pandemic, there have been no known cases of human-to-human transmission involving the viruses that are currently circulating.
However, public health officials expressed concerns last month following the discovery of the first known H5N1 cases in cattle, marking the first time that the virus had jumped from birds to cows.
The dairy cow outbreak began in late March and quickly spread from Texas, where the human case was also diagnosed, to include cases in at least six different states as of Friday.
The CDC said that testing of the virus had not revealed any genetic changes that would increase the likelihood of human infections or hinder the effectiveness of antiviral medications to combat infections.",Newsweek,yes,no,"The article reports that over half of the over 900 human H5N1 cases globally since 1997 have resulted in death, indicating a high mortality rate.

H5N1 Pandemic Test Case—Biden Administration Not Ready,1712707200000,"The H5N1 virus, which for 30 years affected mostly birds, is rapidly evolving and spreading globally. The Biden administration is dangerously unready.
Over the last two years, H5N1 has jumped from birds to mammals, infecting at least 26 species.
South American scientists publishing in the prestigious journal Nature Communications report massive “sea lion die-offs” and warn about avian influenza viruses “potentially evolving into the next global pandemic.”
Here in the United States, dairy cows, never before vulnerable to bird flu, are infected in six states.
Is the public in danger? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the risk is “low” but is advising states to be ready with rapid tests. In the United States, only two human cases have been reported; neither person died.
But according to the World Health Organization (WHO), since 2003, nearly 1,000 people in other parts of the world have contracted the virus—almost always from touching a sick or dead bird or bird feces. Four hundred sixty-three died.
Some food safety experts caution against eating runny egg yolks, cheeses made with raw milk, and foods made with uncooked eggs.
In October 2020, Stanford health professor Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and former Harvard medical professor Dr. Martin Kulldorff co-authored the Great Barrington Declaration, showing that protecting the elderly and vulnerable, rather than shutting down the entire nation, would save more lives. Within hours, federal bigwigs Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci launched a smear campaign to label Bhattacharya and his fellow signers “fringe epidemiologists.”
Worse, the CDC and the Department of Homeland Security conspired with major social media platforms such as YouTube and X (formerly Twitter) to keep the public from hearing from the government’s critics.
Censored scientists sued. The case, Murthy v. Missouri, is now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Sadly, the Biden administration is taking the wrong side, claiming censorship protects the nation from “disinformation.”
Students could contract the virus by touching bird excrement and then their own eyes, nose or mouth, cautions Brown University infectious disease expert Dr. Leonard Mermel.

Avian Flu Found in Seventh State as More Cattle Restrictions Imposed,1712793600000,"Cows in North Carolina tested positive for the influenza.

North Carolina authorities on April 10 reported that cows in the state tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, as the state became the latest to impose restrictions on the movement of cows.
Testing of samples from North Carolina conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) came back positive for the influenza, also known as the bird flu and HPAI, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said.
“We have spent years developing methods to handle HPAI in poultry, but this is new and we are working with our state and federal partners to develop protocols to handle this situation,” Steve Troxler, the state’s agriculture commissioner, said in a statement.
Stephanie Langel, Ph.D, an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine, said on social media that because the influenza is not a reportable disease in cows, it’s likely the outbreak is larger than currently represented.
USDA officials do not require testing and only recommend testing if cows start exhibiting symptoms.
“Additionally, the majority of workers on dairy farms (especially large farms) are undocumented and are less likely to report symptoms,” Ms. Langel said, referring to illegal immigrants. “I worry we are underestimating human infections.”
The strain of HPAI that’s circulating, H5N1, originates from birds. Dead birds have been found on farms that have had cows with confirmed cases.
Bird flu is often fatal in birds and humans, but human cases are rare. The recent human case in Texas is only the second in history in the United States. Both patients recovered, officials say.
Worldwide, between 2003 and April 1 of this year, 889 human cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 23 countries. Of those patients, 463 died, the organization said.
No vaccines are currently available against H5N1.
The movement of cattle from herds with confirmed cases in other states to North Carolina has been suspended, according to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
Several states have said the sick cattle have come from Texas, where the first cases were detected.
Now that 21 herds have tested positive, it “stretches plausibility that it was all from one farm, but theoretically possible, given the amount cattle can move,” Gail Hansen, a doctor of veterinary medicine who used to be the state veterinarian for Kansas, wrote on the social media platform X.
“If cattle must be moved, we strongly encourage extreme diligence by producers, veterinarians, and animal health officials to ensure only healthy cattle are moving and to ensure the validity of interstate health certificates,” the agency said.",EpochTimes,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, with 463 deaths out of 889 cases.

"The dairy industry really, really doesn’t want you to say “bird flu in cows”",1713225600000,"H5N1, or bird flu, has hit dairy farms &mdash; but the dairy industry doesn&rsquo;t want us saying so.&nbsp;
The current, highly virulent strain of avian flu had already been ripping through chicken and turkey farms over the past two years. Since it jumped to US dairy cows for the first time last month, it&rsquo;s infected more than 20 dairy herds across eight states, raising alarms among public health authorities about possible spread to humans and potential impacts on the food supply.&nbsp;
One Texas dairy worker contracted a mild case of bird flu from one of the impacted farms &mdash; the second such case ever recorded in the US (though one of hundreds worldwide over the past two decades, most of them fatal).

Whatever fear-mongering you may have seen on social media, we are not on the cusp of a human bird flu pandemic; the chances of further human spread currently remain low. But that could change. As the virus jumps among new mammal species like cows, the risk that it&rsquo;ll evolve to be able to spread between humans does increase.&nbsp;
But the American Association of Bovine Practitioners (AABP), an organization of beef and dairy veterinarians, declared in a statement (condemned by public health experts) last week that it doesn&rsquo;t believe bird flu in cows should be considered bird flu at all.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The AABP will call this disease Bovine Influenza A Virus (BIAV),&rdquo; the association&rsquo;s executive director K. Fred Gingrich II and president Michael Capel said in a statement, encouraging federal and state regulators to do the same. &ldquo;It is important for the public to understand the difference to maintain confidence in the safety and accessibility of beef and dairy products for consumers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In other words, industry vets are trying to rebrand bird flu so that we keep calm and keep buying cheeseburgers. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re worried about selling products,&rdquo; bovine veterinarian James Reynolds, a professor at Western University&rsquo;s vet school, told me, calling the group&rsquo;s statement &ldquo;disease-washing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Covering bird flu over the last two years, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of wild stuff, but this may be one of the weirdest. And it&rsquo;s more than just a terminological or political spat: It reflects an inescapable paradox about how we produce food.&nbsp;
The meat industry’s infectious disease trap 
Naming infectious diseases is always political.
In this case, the cattle industry appears desperate to distance itself from the bird flu news cycle and avoid the perception that it&rsquo;s contributing to human disease risk. But animal agriculture is one of the top drivers of zoonotic diseases &mdash; and growing global demand for meat, dairy, and eggs may be putting us at ever-greater risk of new outbreaks.&nbsp;
To understand why, one of the most elegant models I&rsquo;ve found is the &ldquo;infectious disease trap,&rdquo; a concept coined in a 2022 paper by New York University environmental scientist Matthew Hayek.&nbsp;
Farming animals for food requires lots of land &mdash; much more land than it would take to grow an equivalent amount of plant-based foods. More than a third of the planet&rsquo;s habitable land is devoted to animal agriculture alone, making it the world&rsquo;s leading cause of deforestation as forests are cleared for farms. That in turn leads to more human and farm animal encounters with wild animals, a major source of new zoonotic diseases.&nbsp;
Animal agriculture&rsquo;s land use can be shrunk through intensification &mdash; densely packing animals into factory farms &mdash; which limits deforestation and helps reduce meat&rsquo;s climate footprint.&nbsp;
But such operations are terrible for animal welfare, and they exacerbate zoonotic disease risk in other ways, allowing viruses to rapidly tear through factory farms filled with thousands of stressed, genetically identical animals.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s been happening at chicken and turkey farms across the US over the last two years &mdash; and to prevent further spread, farmers have killed more than 85 million poultry birds on farms hit with bird flu since 2022, often using a grisly method that kills them via heatstroke. Our current food system is a recipe for brewing more virulent disease strains and, many experts fear, it&rsquo;s a ticking time bomb for the next pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
As long as global meat production expands, Hayek&rsquo;s model explains, both low-density and factory farm-style animal agriculture trap us with rising disease risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;
What does this mean for the future of bird flu in cows?
A lot remains unknown about how bird flu has spread so rapidly among cows on dairy farms as far apart as Michigan and New Mexico.&nbsp;
One plausible theory is that the disease is moving with cows being trucked across the country, just as a human disease might move with people.&nbsp;
In recent years, as the dairy industry has increasingly consolidated into large factory farms, long-distance transportation of cows has become very common, Reynolds explained. Young female calves are often trucked from northern states to warmer climates in the south, then shipped back north when they&rsquo;re old enough to become pregnant and produce milk. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s kind of a constant movement that really didn&rsquo;t exist much 20 years ago,&rdquo; Reynolds said.&nbsp;
Long-distance shipment can inflict extreme suffering on farmed animals, who are treated more like cargo than sentient beings. It&rsquo;s also a hallmark of intensive animal agriculture systems described in the infectious disease trap model, allowing diseases to jump to new regions.&nbsp;
At least 18 states have restricted cow imports from states where dairy cows have tested positive for bird flu. The dairy industry recognizes the risks, Reynolds said, and is making efforts to improve biosecurity on these cross-country journeys. Meanwhile, regulators are scrambling to&nbsp;track the disease&nbsp;and stem its spread &mdash; but&nbsp;experts&nbsp;have&nbsp;argued&nbsp;those&nbsp;efforts don&rsquo;t go nearly far enough,&nbsp;failing to require&nbsp;widespread testing.
And whatever steps are being taken now to stop the spread, the infectious disease trap model shows us that if we&rsquo;re chasing zoonotic diseases after they&rsquo;ve infected farm animals, we&rsquo;re already behind.&nbsp;
Escaping that trap requires a much broader societal rethinking of our factory farm system.&nbsp;

Dr. Peter McCullough on Bird Flu: ‘A Perfect Storm Is Brewing’,1713225600000,"The following content is sponsored by The Wellness Company.
Like clockwork, as we head into another election season, the medical establishment and the mainstream media are sounding the alarm on another potential pandemic: the bird flu.
After warning us for months that 2024 could see another deadly pandemic, the medical establishment and governmental health organizations are sounding the alarm bells on bird flu.

Not only are they drawing comparisons to COVID-19, they are in fact claiming that bird flu has the potential to be 100 TIMES MORE DEADLY!
Now Dr. Peter McCullough has weighed in:
With the fear-mongering campaign of “Disease X” sponsored by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI), people are wondering what virus might infect the world next. A few days ago, the CDC issued a health advisory for the H5N1 bird flu as it was detected in a Texas dairy farm worker. His only symptom was conjunctivitis or inflammation of the eye. As of today, human-to-human transmission has not occurred, and thus H5N1 poses limited risk to humans. However, this may change in the near future, especially if we consider the dark history of gain of function (GOF) research regarding H5N1.
While Dr. McCullough believes bird flu poses little threat to humans at this moment, he does caution that a mutated bird flu pandemic would serve several of the globalists’ goals:
Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum (WEF) believe we should reduce our reliance on animal food products as part of their globalist views… Thus, a food scare in westernized countries with market recalls and destruction of poultry and meat would further the dystopian goals for the Davos club. H5N1 has a historical fatality rate of 52.16 percent in humans; so,  fear alone could drive considerable anxiety in large populations about exposure through food, pets, and other humans.
It’s difficult to determine if H5N1 is the next “Disease X” at the moment. However, it is possible, due to the abundance of GOF research and biotech interests, ready-made vaccines, and powerful drivers of mass panic in the wings. If more cases occur in clusters or bona fide outbreaks with human-to-human transmission, we could be well on our way to a 2024 avian influenza pandemic crisis.
Be Prepared
Now is not the time to panic, nor is this the time to be complacent – now is the time to be prepared.
According to Dr. Kelly Victory, Chief of Emergency & Disaster Medicine for the Wellness Company’s Chief Medical Board:
At present, this appears to be like previous recent bird flu “outbreaks” that effect primarily poultry workers, with little evidence that there is appreciable human-to-human transmission. That being said, this is a good reminder that we always need to be prepared and foster self-reliance in times of emergency. We have every reason to believe, for example, that ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, budesonide, etc. will cover a large range of viral and bacterial illnesses. Keeping these medications on hand allows people to be free from the grip of Big Pharma who would have them believe that every new pathogen or seasonal outbreak requires a new/novel treatment, as well as from the chaos and uncertainty that commonly accompany public health scares.

Risk of Bird Flu Spreading to Humans Is Great Concern: World Health Organization,1713484800000,"H5N1 avian flu has recently infected cows and goats in the United States.

There’s a risk that avian influenza, after spreading to several new mammal species, will begin to infect more humans, the chief scientist of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on April 18.
Highly pathogenic avian influenza A, or H5N1, has recently infected cows and goats in the United States after spreading among chickens for years.
H5N1 has kept circulating to new species and has “become a global zoonotic animal pandemic,” Jeremy Farrar, the WHO’s chief scientist, told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland.
“The great concern, of course, is that in doing so, and infecting ducks and chickens but now increasingly mammals, that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans, and then critically the ability to go from human to human,” he said.
Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has infected cattle in eight states, most recently in South Dakota. One person in Texas has been confirmed to have contracted the illness. Sequencing of a sample collected from that patient showed that the virus had one change from earlier animal sequencing, and the change has been linked with making the virus more likely to infect animals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated this month.
However, the change has been detected before, with no evidence that the influenza has then spread onward among people, according to the agency.
“Further, there are no markers known to be associated with influenza antiviral resistance found in the virus sequences from the patient’s specimen and the virus is very closely related to two existing HPAI A(H5N1) candidate vaccine viruses that are already available to manufacturers, and which could be used to make vaccine if needed,” the CDC stated.
Since 2003, 889 humans have had confirmed infections, and 463 of those infected died, according to the WHO.
“We know that in the rare cases ... so far in humans, the mortality rate is extremely high,” Mr. Farrar said. “So to me, this is a major concern.”
Crucial questions to answer include how the influenza is transmitted to cows and whether any additional people have contracted the flu from cattle.
Some previous influenza strains have adapted to start spreading among humans, including H1N1.
The CDC has said that the strain currently circulating is closely related to several vaccine candidates that are available for production.
Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the CDC, told Politico that if certain developments take place, such as human-to-human transmission, then U.S. authorities would step up the response to the next level.
The CDC declined a request for comment, but a spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said the agency has already approved three H5N1 vaccines, from Sanofi Pasteur, the ID Biomedical Corporation of Quebec, and Seqirus and is ready to act if needed.
“If it is determined that the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated to prevent H5N1 influenza, then the anticipated regulatory pathway would likely be for those manufacturers who have an approved H5N1 influenza vaccine to submit a manufacturing strain change supplement to FDA, as occurs for the seasonal influenza vaccines,” the spokesperson told The Epoch Times in an email.
Even with the prior approval, immunogenicity data from clinical trials with vaccines with updated strains would be needed, according to FDA guidance.
Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response, told Politico that hundreds of thousands of doses would be ready to be administered within weeks if the FDA cleared the updated vaccines.
A spokesman for the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which Ms. O'Connell leads, told The Epoch Times that agencies across the government are monitoring the bird flu situation.
“[The program] works closely with industry partners to make and test updated vaccines that match new strains of influenza viruses with pandemic potential as they emerge, while at the same time, supporting manufacturing capacity to allow for large-scale vaccine production if needed,” he said. “Vaccine candidates being developed and tested under this preparedness program, in close coordination with manufacturers are expected to match the current strain.”
The Department of Agriculture stated last week that it is looking into developing a poultry vaccine against H5N1 “to stock and use in an emergency.”",EpochTimes,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate of 463 deaths out of 889 confirmed infections, but it does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.",become a global zoonotic animal pandemic,Jeremy Farrar,0.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,6.0,8.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,5,2,7,4,3,6,6,6,3,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,12.7,13.98,0.0181212121,0.1386363636,0.038469697,0.1526060606,0.0459090909,0.2834393939,0.4081515152,0.0742424242,0.0228484848,0.2007575758,0.0,0.19525,0.0,0.23425,0.16225,0.23425,0.51775,0.0,0.03125,0.129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.664,0.0,1.414,0.0,0.75,0.0,0.0,,"The great concern, of course, is that in doing so, and infecting ducks and chickens but now increasingly mammals, that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans, and then critically the ability to go from human to human",Jeremy Farrar,"We know that in the rare cases ... so far in humans, the mortality rate is extremely high",Jeremy Farrar,0.0,3.0,2.0,7.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,7.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,0.0,0.3085,0.3515,0.0,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.156,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,1.156,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,"If it is determined that the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated to prevent H5N1 influenza, then the anticipated regulatory pathway would likely be for those manufacturers who have an approved H5N1 influenza vaccine to submit a manufacturing strain change supplement to FDA, as occurs for the seasonal influenza vaccines",FDA spokesperson,,,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0795,0.0,0.0825,0.1123333333,0.0825,0.2973333333,0.0,0.0,0.1055,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Zachary Stieber,703.0,epoch_times_h5n1_scraped_data_clean.xlsx,False,,,,,h5n1,https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/risk-of-bird-flu-spreading-to-humans-is-great-concern-world-health-organization-5632723,2024-04-24,[],"['/_next/static/media/menuSearch.9968d4ed.svg', '/_next/static/media/logo.32553ed2.svg', '/_next/static/media/epoch-health-logo.c57286f5.svg', '/_next/static/media/epoch-health-logo.c57286f5.svg', '/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.theepochtimes.com%2Fassets%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F04%2F19%2Fid5632934-norway-birds-LSedit-1080x720.jpg&w=1200&q=75', '/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.theepochtimes.com%2Fassets%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F07%2F22%2FWEB_ZacharyStieber-1.jpg&w=256&q=75', '/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.theepochtimes.com%2Fassets%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F03%2F16%2Fbaseimage-5-300x180.jpg&w=3840&q=75', '/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.theepochtimes.com%2Fassets%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F04%2F18%2Fid5632150-shutterstock_2204744583-300x180.jpg&w=3840&q=75', '/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.theepochtimes.com%2Fassets%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F07%2F22%2FWEB_ZacharyStieber-1.jpg&w=256&q=75', '/_next/static/media/x-icon.049b3ed0.svg', '/_next/static/media/truth-icon.1b72c535.svg', '/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.theepochtimes.com%2Fassets%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F11%2F01%2Fid5752014-Young_Thug_Trial_24305754267726-LSedit-1080x720.jpg&w=1200&q=75', '/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.theepochtimes.com%2Fassets%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F11%2F09%2FEpochImages-7762764359-700x420.jpg&w=1200&q=75', '/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.theepochtimes.com%2Fassets%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F10%2F21%2Fid5745150-Elon-Musk-GettyImages-2179031007KO-1080x720.jpg&w=1200&q=75', '/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.theepochtimes.com%2Fassets%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F10%2F31%2Fid5751495-BallotKO-1080x720.jpg&w=1200&q=75', '/_next/static/media/epoch-health-logo-slogan.c908934d.svg', '/_next/static/media/epoch-health-logo.c57286f5.svg', '/_next/static/media/Twitter-Green.56c41d42.svg', '/_next/static/media/Instagram-Green.75fbb2b0.svg', '/_next/static/media/Facebook-Green.a9e19a15.svg']",,,,,,epochtimes,Right

Breaking News—Tamiflu Added to Contagion Kit to Combat Bird Flu,1713571200000,"The following content is sponsored by The Wellness Company.
The Chief Medical Board of The Wellness Company has been closely watching the avian flu (H5N1) outbreak here in the United States over the last few weeks. While it is far from certain that this most recent strand of bird flu will result in a pandemic, Dr. Peter McCullough and his colleagues on the Chief Medical Board voted to add Tamiflu to the Contagion Kit out of an abundance of caution.

Dr. McCullough said:
Out of an abundance of caution, we are adding Tamiflu to the Contagion Kit. Tamiflu is a safe medication approved treat Influenza type A, viruses like avian flu. We will continue to closely monitor this situation and make further recommendations as warranted.
Tamiflu Oseltamivir (generic Tamiflu) is an antiviral medication that disrupts the replication of the Influenza A and B viruses, including the avian “bird flu” H5N1 variant, within the body to reduce the severity of flu symptoms.
Dr. McCullough raised concerns over the last few weeks that a virus like the current H5N1 strand of avian flu has many of the hallmarks of a potential pandemic scare:
With the fear-mongering campaign of “Disease X” sponsored by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI), people are wondering what virus might infect the world next. A few days ago, the CDC issued a health advisory for the H5N1 bird flu as it was detected in a Texas dairy farm worker. His only symptom was conjunctivitis or inflammation of the eye. As of today, human-to-human transmission has not occurred, and thus H5N1 poses limited risk to humans. However, this may change in the near future, especially if we consider the dark history of gain of function (GOF) research regarding H5N1.
While Dr. McCullough says the risk to humans is low, for now, he does caution that a mutated bird flu pandemic would serve several of the globalists’ goals:
Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum (WEF) believe we should reduce our reliance on animal food products as part of their globalist views… Thus, a food scare in westernized countries with market recalls and destruction of poultry and meat would further the dystopian goals for the Davos club. H5N1 has a historical fatality rate of 52.16 percent in humans; so,  fear alone could drive considerable anxiety in large populations about exposure through food, pets, and other humans.
It’s difficult to determine if H5N1 is the next “Disease X” at the moment. However, it is possible, due to the abundance of GOF research and biotech interests, ready-made vaccines, and powerful drivers of mass panic in the wings. If more cases occur in clusters or bona fide outbreaks with human-to-human transmission, we could be well on our way to a 2024 avian influenza pandemic crisis.

"Bird flu virus found in pasteurized milk, though officials maintain supply is safe",1713830400000,"The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that fragments of the bird flu virus had been detected in some samples of pasteurized milk in the U.S. While the agency maintains that the milk is safe to drink, it notes that it is still waiting on the results of studies to confirm this. The findings come less than a month after an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu was found, for the first time, in herds of dairy cows in several states. It has since been detected in herds in eight states.  The FDA has been working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to investigate the outbreak. The fragments of the virus were found while testing samples of pasteurized milk, the FDA said. The testing method, called PCR testing, looks for bits of genetic material; a positive result doesn’t mean that live, infectious virus has been found. “Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles,” the agency said in a release that it plans to make public later Tuesday. “To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.” The FDA is specifically testing whether pasteurization inactivates bird flu in cow milk. The findings will be available in the “next few days to weeks,” it said. As a part of its testing, it will use so-called egg inoculation tests — considered the gold standard for determining if a sample is infectious — in which a chicken egg is injected with a small amount of infected milk and monitored to see if active virus begins to replicate. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he was not surprised by the preliminary findings.  “If you tested most milk, you’d find E. coli and listeria and other things in it, too, but they’d all be dead. Pasteurization doesn’t take them out, it just kills them,” he said. That is, dead particles are unlikely to cause a person to get sick.  “I wouldn’t have any problem drinking milk tonight from an influenza standpoint at all,” Osterholm said. “My grandchildren could drink the milk tonight.” But there has been a scarcity of information on the matter coming from the USDA, he said. More data is needed to fully understand what’s going on with the current bird flu virus in dairy cows. “We have a need for a lot of additional information that hasn’t been forthcoming,” Osterholm said. “We don’t know the epidemiology on these farms. We don’t know how many farms, how many samples. We have been very concerned.” The FDA said it has also recommended that milk producers take precautions when discarding milk from sick cows so that the discarded milk does not become a source of spread.  One person has been infected during the current outbreak. The person, a dairy worker in Texas, had a mild case and only developed conjunctivitis, or pinkeye. A senior official at the CDC also said the agency is monitoring the situation for signs of unusual illness in people and has not seen any beyond the Texas case.

"As bird flu spreads in the U.S., is it safe to eat eggs? What to know about the risk.",1713830400000,"In early April, a dairy worker in Texas tested positive for avian influenza, also known as bird flu, amid a multi-state outbreak of the virus among cows. The bird flu virus has also been detected in raw milk, but authorities say the current risk to the public is low. It’s the first time this strain of bird flu — referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) — has been detected in cattle and the first documented cow-to-human transmission of an avian influenza virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The person in Texas is only the second case of bird flu in a human ever reported in the United States. While there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, health officials are on high alert. In a recent press conference, a leading expert at the World Health Organization called the risk of the bird flu spreading to humans “an enormous concern.” Speaking to reporters on April 18, WHO chief scientist Dr. Jeremy Farrar warned that bird flu viruses are increasingly infecting mammals. “The great concern ... is that the virus evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,” Farrar said. Is bird flu a problem now? The current bird flu outbreak is affecting cows in over a dozen dairy farms across the country. Although the risk to humans is considered low, health officials are calling for increased monitoring of infected animals and people exposed to them. While the thought of “bird flu” may sound alarming and stoke Covid-19 pandemic fears, influenza among birds is not new. “The current bird flu strain that we’re concerned with, H5N1, has actually been circulating around the world for quite some time,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. H5N1 is widespread among wild birds and is causing an ongoing outbreak among poultry in the U.S., according to the CDC. What is bird flu? Bird flu is a disease caused by infection with avian influenza type A viruses. Avian influenza A viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds, such as geese, ducks and swans, Schaffner said, but they can also circulate among domestic poultry. “Bird flu viruses occasionally get into other mammalian species (like pigs). We’ve all heard of swine flu,” Schaffner said. Avian influenza A viruses can also infect horses, bats and dogs, per the CDC — rarely, they spread to humans. “More recently, we have seen an increase of infections in cattle,” said Dr. Hilary M. Babcock, infectious disease specialist at Washington University of St. Louis and BJC Healthcare. This is the first time the avian influenza strain of highly pathogenic H5N1, which causes severe and often fatal disease in birds, has been found in cows. “That’s pretty unusual,” said Schaffner. However, this H5N1 strain does not seem to be making cows very sick, he added. What states have bird flu? Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (which include the strain of H5N1 that’s currently spreading) have been detected in the U.S. in wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks beginning in January 2022, according to the CDC. Overall, 48 states have reported cases of highly pathogenic H5N1. The current outbreak of H5N1 affecting cows has spread to eight states so far, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As of April 11, cases have been reported among dairy herds in: TexasKansasMichiganNew MexicoIdahoOhioNorth CarolinaSouth Dakota Currently, only one human in Texas is known to have contracted H5N1 in this outbreak, experts say. There have been only two human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. ever, said Babcock — the first case was detected in Colorado in 2022 in a person who had direct contact with infected poultry. As H5N1 surveillance increases, experts anticipate the number of cases among cows to increase. “We’re looking harder now and finding more cases (among cattle) that even 10 years ago would have gone undetected,” Schaffner said. The risk to the general public in the U.S. is low, experts say. For people exposed due to their line of work, the risk is considered “low-to-moderate,” the World Health Organization said in a statement. How does the bird flu spread to humans? “Every once in a while, a bird flu virus can get into a human, but that’s rare,” Schaffner said. Avian influenza viruses can spread from infected birds to humans in a few ways, according to the CDC: Directly from an infected birdFrom environments contaminated with avian influenza virusThrough an intermediate host, such as an animal Infected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, mucus and feces. People can become infected when a large enough amount of the virus gets into the mouth, nose, eyes or is inhaled, Schaffner said. Transmission to humans typically occurs through close contact with infected birds without protective gear. It can also occur if a person touches contaminated surfaces and puts their hands in their eyes or mouth or if they breathe in droplets from the air, per the CDC. It was not immediately clear how the dairy cow infected the person in Texas, experts note. The only other person who contracted H5N1 in the U.S. was directly involved in the culling of birds presumed to be infected with H5N1, said Babcock. Sporadic cases of H5N1 in humans have been reported around the world, often in rural areas where people live closely with poultry or other birds. According to the WHO, since 2003 there have been 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 in 23 countries. Once the bird flu gets into a human, “it is almost never spread to anyone else,” said Schaffner. However, “there are ultra-rare instances of transmission from a person very sick with bird flu to a family member or caregiver.” No human-to-human spread has occurred with the contemporary H5N1 viruses currently spreading in birds, the CDC said. When this does happen, it does not lead to continued spread between people “because the virus doesn’t have the (genetic) capacity to spread easily from person to person,” Schaffner said. “This strain of bird flu has been around for about a decade and it still has not picked up this capacity to spread readily from person to person, thankfully. ... That should be a matter of reassurance, but also keep us in public health on alert,” said Schaffner. Can you get bird flu through eggs? There is no evidence that people can get bird flu from food that’s been properly prepared and cooked, and it is safe to eat eggs, chicken and beef, and drink pasteurized milk, experts say. “We have not seen cases that have been from ingesting animal products or animals that may have been infected,” said Babcock. The infected dairy cow herds that have been detected are in quarantine and their milk is being destroyed, Schaffner said. In a statement, the USDA said the commercial milk supply in the U.S. remains safe. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it does not currently have concerns about the safety of pasteurized milk products, including pasteurized cheese. “The pasteurization process in the U.S. keeps our milk supply very safe,” Babcock said. Pasteurization heats the milk to a high enough temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, including influenza. Drinking unpasteurized or “raw” milk, which is increasingly trendy, is associated with various infectious disease hazards, Schaffner said. “I discourage people from drinking raw milk,” he added. The risk of humans becoming infected by eating eggs from poultry with H5N1 is low, the FDA says, and there are safeguards in place to identify infected poultry and remove their eggs from the market. It’s possible for products from infected animals to end up in the food supply, said Babcock, but the risk to humans is still very low. Properly storing and cooking food further reduces that risk. Although beef cattle are not involved in this outbreak, Schaffner recommends cooking beef to a safe internal temperature. The FDA recommends cooking eggs until the white and yolk are firm. “There are other reasons that you shouldn’t eat raw eggs (or meat), because these can carry lots of different pathogens,” Babcock said. What happens if a human gets the bird flu? Bird flu infections in humans can range in severity, experts note. Some people have zero or only mild symptoms, while others develop severe disease, according to the CDC.  “It can be a serious infection with a high mortality rate,” Schaffner said. The Texas patient had a mild infection, with eye redness as the only symptom, the CDC said. “It was not even a respiratory infection. It was ... conjunctivitis or pink eye,” Schaffner noted. The patient was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. “We have antiviral medications, the same ones we use to treat regular flu, that work against this avian influenza strain,” Schaffner said. The other human case of H5N1 in the U.S. in 2022 was a mild infection as well, Babcock added. Symptoms of bird flu in humans According to the CDC and experts, the reported signs and symptoms of avian influenza in humans include: FeverCoughRunny noseMuscle or body achesHeadacheFatigueShortness of breathEye redness or inflammation (conjunctivitis)DiarrheaNausea Bird flu in humans may look similar to a regular flu or upper respiratory infection, said Babcock, or a person may have no obvious symptoms. It can also lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure and other complications. “There’s a full range,” she added. There is no way to diagnose an infection with bird flu by symptoms alone, the CDC says. Laboratory testing is required. Can you recover from bird flu? Yes, you can recover from bird flu. The person recently infected in Texas was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. The Colorado patient infected in 2022 also recovered. Globally, bird flu symptoms have ranged from mild to severe, resulting in death in some cases, according to the CDC. How to prevent spread of bird flu Although the risk of getting bird flu is low, the CDC recommends the following protective actions: Avoid visiting poultry farms if possibleIf visiting poultry farms, wear a mask and avoid touching birdsAvoid sick or dead birdsMaintain good hand hygieneDo not eat raw or undercooked poultryVisit a doctor if you become sick after contact with birds",NBCNews,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, citing 463 deaths out of 889 cases globally since 2003.

Dairy Cows Must Be Tested for Bird Flu Before Moving Between States: USDA,1713916800000,"New order announced Wednesday.

Dairy cows cannot be moved between states without testing for the highly pathogenic avian influenza, U.S. officials announced on April 24.
A strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A, H5N1, has been spreading across the country since first being detected in cows in March. The influenza is commonly known as the bird flu.
At this point, no beef cattle are known to have been infected with the virus.
The order, which takes effect on April 29, covers lactating dairy cattle.
Testing requirements for other dairy cows “will be based on scientific factors concerning the virus and its evolving risk profile,” the USDA said.
The testing must be done by an approved National Animal Health Laboratory Network lab.
Positive flu tests will prohibit cows from being moved for 30 days and until they test negative, USDA officials said.
Owners of herds that contain cows that test positive will be required to provide epidemiological information to authorities, including information on where the cows have been, authorities said.
Testing of cows for the bird flu has to present only been done on a voluntary basis. Farmers had been directed to only test cows displaying symptoms, such as decreased appetite.
As of Wednesday, 33 herds across eight states, including Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas, have tested positive for the bird flu.
Some states had already imposed restrictions on interstate movement of cattle in light of the situation.
The USDA is also mandating that labs and state veterinarians report positive Influenza A test results from livestock to the agency.
The flu had been circulating in birds domestically before infecting cattle and goats.
The steps came after the USDA said the virus has spread between cows, including cows that have not shown symptoms.
“The novel movement of H5N1 between wild birds and dairy cows requires further testing and time to develop a critical understanding to support any future courses of action,” the USDA said in a statement. “This federal order is critical to increasing the information available for USDA. Requiring positive test reporting will help USDA better under this disease and testing before interstate movement will limit its spread.”
One person was confirmed this year to have contracted the bird flu after being in close contact with sickened cows in Texas. That person was recovering, authorities said in the last update on the case. Another person previously became ill with the flu in Colorado but eventually recovered.
Authorities say the risk to the public is low and testing of the flu samples has uncovered no signs that the virus has changed to make it more transmissible to people or among people.
Bird flu cases have rarely appeared among humans in the United States but hundreds have been confirmed worldwide since 2003. Through April 1, out of 889 cases across 23 countries, 463 resulted in death, according to the World Health Organization.
If that happens, then it’s crucial to quickly respond with vaccines, testing, and treatments, he said.
Several vaccines against H5N1 have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but manufacturers would need to receive fresh clearance for updated formulations, an agency spokesperson told The Epoch Times in an email.
The manufacturers, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, and CSL Seqirus said in statements they are monitoring avian flu and stand ready to develop avian influenza vaccines as needed.
There have so far been few deaths among cows that tested positive for the influenza, according to the USDA. Some have already been cleared and started producing milk again for commercial consumption.
For now, pasteurized milk is safe “based on the information we currently have available,” USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters.
He disclosed that the samples that tested positive came from cows without symptoms.
The USDA has carried out more than 2,000 tests on cattle samples over the last several weeks, Mr. Vilsack said.
“It surely is possible that there could be much more virus infection in cows throughout the United States,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota.
Bird flu was initially confirmed in raw milk from cows with the virus and authorities had claimed no milk with the influenza would enter the food supply due to measures such as pasteurization.

What to know about the latest bird flu outbreak in the US,1713916800000,"There have been numerous developments this week concerning avian flu that have raised concerns among experts
What to know about the latest bird flu outbreak in the USBy SEAN MURPHYAssociated PressThe Associated Press
A poultry facility in Michigan and egg producer in Texas both reported outbreaks of avian flu this week. The latest developments on the virus also include infected dairy cows and the first known instance of a human catching bird flu from a mammal.
Although health officials say the risk to the public remains low, there is rising concern, emerging in part from news that the largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S. reported an outbreak.
Here are some key things to know about the disease.
WHAT ARE EXPERTS SAYING?
Dr. Mandy Cohen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency is taking bird flu seriously, but stressed that the virus has already been well studied.
“The fact that it is in cattle now definitely raises our concern level,” Cohen said, noting that it means farmworkers who work with cattle — and not just those working with birds — may need to take precautions.
The good news is that “it’s not a new strain of the virus,” Cohen added. “This is known to us and we’ve been studying it, and frankly, we’ve been preparing for avian flu for 20 years.”
WHAT IS BIRD FLU?
Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but others chiefly occur in animals. Avian viruses spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry.
The bird flu virus drawing attention today — Type A H5N1 — was first identified in 1959. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself.
Since 2020, the virus has been spreading among more animal species — including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises — in scores of countries.
In the U.S., this version of the bird flu has been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks. Nationwide, tens of millions of chickens have died from the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading.
Last week, U.S. officials said it had been found in livestock. As of Tuesday, it had been discovered in dairy herds in five states — Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas — according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE GET BIRD FLU?
This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. In the past two decades, nearly 900 people have been diagnosed globally with bird flu and more than 460 people have died, according to the World Health Organization.
There have been only two cases in the U.S., and neither were fatal.
In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.
This week, Texas health officials announced that a person who had been in contact with cows had been diagnosed with bird flu. Their only reported symptom was eye redness.
WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF BIRD FLU?
Symptoms are similar to that of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people don’t have noticeable symptoms, but others develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia.
CAN IT SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE?
The vast majority of infected people have gotten it directly from birds, but scientists are on guard for any sign of spread among people.
There have been a few instances when that apparently happened — most recently in 2007 in Asia. In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home.
U.S. health officials have stressed that the current public health risk is low and that there is no sign that bird flu is spreading person to person.
WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT?
While it’s too early to quantify the potential economic impact of a bird flu outbreak, many of these latest developments are concerning, particularly the transmission of the virus from one species to another, said Darin Detwiler, a food safety and policy expert at Northeastern University.
“We don’t have a magic forcefield, an invisible shield that protects land and water runoff from impacting other species,” Detwiler said. “There is a concern in terms of how this might impact other markets, the egg market, the beef market.”
If the outbreak is not quickly contained, consumers could ultimately see higher prices, and if it continues to spread, some industries could experience “reputational strain,” possibly affecting the export industry, Detwiler added.
The egg industry already is experiencing some tightening of supply following detections of bird flu late in 2023 and in early January, coupled with the busy Easter season, where Americans typically consume an average of 3 billion eggs, said Marc Dresner, a spokesperson for the American Egg Board.
Still, even with the outbreak in Texas and the nearly 2 million birds that were killed there, Dresner said there are an estimated 310 million egg laying hens in the U.S. and wholesale egg prices are down about 25% from a February peak.

"1 in 5 samples of pasteurized milk had bird flu virus fragments, FDA says",1714089600000,"The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that traces of the bird flu virus have been found in 1 in 5 samples of pasteurized milk, providing a more detailed picture of how much of the milk supply has been affected. The tested milk came from a nationally representative sample, with more of the positive results coming from milk in areas with infected herds of dairy cows, the FDA said. A spokesperson declined to say how many samples were tested. As of Thursday, bird flu had been detected in 33 herds in eight states: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio and Texas. Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, said the number of positive samples is consistent with numbers he's reviewed from smaller sample sets. ""But the number does seem high if the number of infected farms is indeed only 30-odd,” Webby wrote in an email. ""Clearly there are more infected animals out there than being reported.""  The FDA first said Tuesday that it had found viral fragments in commercially sold milk, triggering the Agriculture Department to issue a federal order mandating that all dairy cows be tested for bird flu before they are transported between states.  Health officials maintain — and experts agree — that pasteurized milk is safe to drink. The FDA detected small pieces of the virus in milk, not live, infectious virus.  “Right now, all indication is that pasteurization is effective,” said Dr. Andrew Bowman, a veterinary epidemiologist at Ohio State University. The FDA said Tuesday, “To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.” It is conducting studies on the effects of pasteurization on the bird flu virus in milk and expects to release results in the coming days. The virus, a strain of bird flu called H5N1, is concerning to public health officials because of its high fatality rate: More than half of the people who have contracted the illness have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the virus does not spread easily between people, and while it can cause severe illness, the only two cases reported in the U.S. — one in the current outbreak and one in 2022 — have been mild.

Could bird flu cause a human pandemic?,1714435200000,"Last year, when an H5N1 avian flu virus &mdash; commonly known as bird flu &mdash; was spilling over from bird populations into a variety of wild mammals, Seema Lakdawala, a virologist and influenza A transmission specialist at Emory University, was &ldquo;not overly concerned&rdquo; about human risk. We don&rsquo;t have &ldquo;much of an interface with seals or with foxes, for that matter, or polar bears,&rdquo; she says.
But when it comes to cows, that interface is vast. People on dairy farms regularly interact with cows and their milk; when the animals and their milk are infected with a virus that can cause disease in humans, and that mutates constantly, each of those interactions functions as an opportunity for the virus to workshop its adaptability.&nbsp; Now, says Lakdawala, &ldquo;I am more concerned than I have been, and it&rsquo;s not for the general public &mdash;&nbsp;it is for dairy workers.&rdquo;
The H5N1 outbreak among cows on 34 dairy farms in nine states has so far led to only one very mild human infection. However, the virus was likely spreading among cows for months before it was detected. Lakdawala&rsquo;s greatest concern is that this highly changeable virus has now arrived at an important point of human-animal convergence, and that we are not prepared.&nbsp;
For a virus to cause a human pandemic, it has to have three important characteristics, say flu experts. It has to cause human disease; it has to be something our immune systems haven&rsquo;t encountered before; and it must spread easily among humans, especially through the air. The latest events do not yet demonstrate that H5N1 has new capacities in any of these categories. However, they hint that the virus has the machinery to evolve those capacities &mdash; and that it could do so before we know it.
In dairy cows, H5N1 has found an excellent laboratory for evolving traits dangerous to humans
Although Lakdawala was concerned when mink, seals, and other mammals were infected with H5N1 last year and the year before, cows are different. An outbreak among &ldquo;mammals with a large interface with humans&rdquo; is a red flag to her.
It&rsquo;s a numbers game. Although all viruses mutate routinely, flu viruses are particularly good at shapeshifting and can even swap entire chunks of genetic material with other flu viruses if an animal is co-infected with more than one of them. These mutations happen randomly, and most don&rsquo;t make the viruses more dangerous to humans &mdash; but it&rsquo;s entirely realistic to imagine that some occasionally do. If that occasionally human-threatening mutation happens to a flu virus that has infected, say, a wild fox, it doesn&rsquo;t pose a particularly high risk of causing a pandemic among humans. After all, few wild foxes have contact with humans. If it happens in a cow, however, there are far more opportunities for the virus to effectively workshop its new features.
People who work on dairy farms are constantly interacting with cows and their milk &mdash; they check udders, hook and unhook milking machines, and perform other tasks to care for the animals. That puts them in lots of contact with any virus infecting the cows. If the virus were one that didn&rsquo;t infect and kill people or that doesn&rsquo;t mutate and adapt as easily as the flu does, perhaps it wouldn&rsquo;t be as concerning &mdash; but H5N1 does infect people at close proximity to animals, and at least half of the more than 900 people who&rsquo;ve been infected with the virus since it came on the scene in 1996 have died.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is a high viral load in milk of these infected cows, and so it is a concern to me in terms of spillover [from] cows into workers,&rdquo; says Lakdawala. &ldquo;And the more often the virus has an attempt to spill over, the more likely it is to adapt.&rdquo;
We already know the virus is adapting in mammals, she says. &ldquo;The more spillover events, the more attempts that the virus has to find a successful variant that can take off or infect the human &mdash; and then one infected individual, three infected individuals, go home&rdquo; to their families, where they could potentially spread the virus further.
It&rsquo;s not a pandemic right now, she says, but now is the time to act to reduce the opportunities for spillover events.
For the first time, we have proof of H5N1 spreading among a mammalian species
When a virus leaps from one species into another, that&rsquo;s not usually enough to cause a large outbreak. You could look at H5N1&rsquo;s history: Although the virus has leapt from animals into people hundreds of times, it has very rarely spread among people. When infections effectively stop spreading once they cross species lines, the non-transmitting species is called a &ldquo;dead-end host.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Birds readily transmit H5N1 to other birds, but until recently, scientists have thought mammals getting infected with H5N1 were dead-end hosts. In the past couple of years, they&rsquo;ve had some sneaking suspicion that minks and other mammals getting infected with the virus were spreading it among themselves &mdash; but they never had definitive proof. That is, they couldn&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that all the animals had gotten infected by eating bits of the same sick bird, or through another so-called &ldquo;common source&rdquo; exposure.
It&rsquo;s much harder to contain a pathogen&rsquo;s spread within a species if members of that species can transmit it to each other. What the dairy cow outbreak shows for the first time is that mammals can indeed now infect each other with H5N1 &mdash; and can do it efficiently.
&ldquo;Genetic data and epidemiologic data are all quite strongly suggesting that these viruses are getting transmitted in some way between these cows,&rdquo; says Louise Moncla, a veterinary pathobiologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine whose team has analyzed genetic data from infected cows that the US government recently made available.
This virus’s mode of transmission isn’t apparent yet — and it matters
It&rsquo;s not yet clear how the virus is being spread through and between dairy cow herds. High viral loads in cows&rsquo; udders and in their unpasteurized milk make it possible that contact with contaminated milking machines is doing most of the transmission. However, it&rsquo;s also possible the virus is spreading through the fecal-oral route or through contaminated air; the latter would be particularly concerning because it&rsquo;s so much harder to prevent. (Moncla notes that while the classic genetic fingerprint for a bird flu&rsquo;s ability to spread through air between mammals is absent from this strain of H5N1, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ve ruled out respiratory spread.)
Regardless of exactly how H5N1 is spreading among cows, the significance that they&rsquo;re transmitting the virus to each other is clear to flu experts: If the virus has adapted to spread among one mammalian species, it raises the specter that it can also adapt to spread among humans.
There is a precedent for flu viruses to spread from livestock to humans, leading to a pandemic: The 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak began when a flu virus spread from pigs to humans. It caused far less death than expected through a stroke of luck &mdash; because the virus had similarities to strains that circulated in the first few decades of the 20th century, many older adults still had some flu immunity left over from childhood infections.
If H5N1 develops the ability to spread among humans, it would be a novel infection to most immune systems, giving us much less protection from old flu infections. There are &ldquo;no signs of that [ability] so far in the cattle sequences,&rdquo; says Andrew Pekosz, a virologist who studies respiratory virus biology at Johns Hopkins University&rsquo;s Bloomberg School of Public Health. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good thing.&rdquo;
Still, because we don&rsquo;t know much about how influenza A viruses like H5N1 behave in cows, we don&rsquo;t yet know what cautionary measures will do the most to slow their spread. In 2011, scientists learned that the influenza D virus causes respiratory illness in cattle. However, not all flu viruses are created equal: &ldquo;I did not ever anticipate seeing an influenza A in cattle,&rdquo; says Lakdawala.
While influenza D infections don&rsquo;t appear to cause much disease in humans, influenza A viruses very much do: All of the past global flu pandemics have been caused by influenza A viruses.&nbsp;
Because this is such an unusual event, says Moncla, &ldquo;we know very little about how flu replicates and transmits in cows.&rdquo; That makes it hard to quickly design and implement precautions to prevent the virus from spreading to the people who handle them.
&ldquo;What would calm me down is if we started implementing interventions that would mitigate the presence of the virus and its transmission amongst cattle, and spilling over into humans,&rdquo; says Lakdawala. &ldquo;Say, okay: Every dairy farm worker is gonna wear a face shield,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
It would help to know whether cows that are infected but asymptomatic have infectious virus in their milk, and whether they can transmit virus to each other, says Pekosz. Ongoing studies by academics and federal agencies should help answer those questions.&nbsp;
Here’s why you shouldn’t panic
At the moment, there are more &ldquo;coulds&rdquo; than &ldquo;ares&rdquo; with H5N1: Although the virus is showing that it could adapt further to spread among humans, so far it hasn&rsquo;t; and while it&rsquo;s reasonable to conduct studies to ensure pasteurization works against this particular strain of H5N1, there&rsquo;s no reason to think it won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s also worth noting that, according to a US Department of Agriculture representative who recently spoke to the press, the virus has so far not caused severe disease or death in the cows it has infected &mdash; they&rsquo;ve all recovered with supportive care. In that way, this outbreak is very different from the ones we&rsquo;ve seen in some other mammals.
Furthermore, testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already demonstrated that existing antiviral medications are effective at preventing human infections with this strain of H5N1 and that two existing candidate vaccines could be used to rapidly scale up mass production of human vaccines against this virus if needed.
So for now, the general public shouldn&rsquo;t be overly concerned about the virus, says Pekosz. &ldquo;Scientists are &hellip; working extra overtime for this. But the general public should still feel safe.&rdquo;",Vox,yes,no,"The article mentions that at least half of the more than 900 people infected with H5N1 since 1996 have died, indicating a high human mortality rate.

"Dr. McCullough on Bird Flu: ‘Fear Mongering, Food Supply Threat, Virus with a Deadly Past – a Perfect Storm is Brewing’",1714435200000,"The following content is sponsored by The Wellness Company.
After warning us for months that 2024 could see another deadly pandemic, the medical establishment and governmental health organizations are sounding the alarm bells on bird flu.
Not only are they drawing comparisons to COVID-19, they are in fact claiming that bird flu has the potential to be 100 TIMES MORE DEADLY!
Dr. Peter McCullough, one of the nation’s most trusted medical experts, has been following the situation closely and notes:
So far there is just one mild human case in West Texas. However, if we begin to hear about more human cases or human-to-human spread, it’s pandemic “game-on” for “Disease X” avian influenza. We should all be prepared.
Get the Medications Dr. McCullough Recommends!
Dr. McCullough and his expert colleagues at The Wellness Company have the prescription medications you need to stay safe from bird flu, COVID, run-of-the-mill flu, or whatever the globalists cook up next!
You can order those critical meds here.

Dr. McCullough and his colleagues continue to make adjustments to their Contagion Kit to keep you and your family healthy and safe:
The Wellness Company has expanded the black Contagion Home Kit to include CDC recommended oseltamivir, which, according to the National Library of Medicine, “exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the activity of the viral neuraminidase enzyme found on the surface of [avian influenza], which prevents budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity.” In adult seasonal influenza it is modestly effective; however, it is optimized by starting on the first day of symptoms or used as chemoprophylaxis in close contact. Therefore, it must be in the house, at the ready with the Wellness Company Contagion Kit. Oseltamivir will be helpful to have on hand for seasonal influenza during the usual winter flu season.
Be Prepared, Not Scared
While Dr. McCullough says bird flu poses little threat to humans at this moment, he does caution that a mutated bird flu pandemic would serve several of the globalists’ goals:
Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum (WEF) believe we should reduce our reliance on animal food products as part of their globalist views… Thus, a food scare in westernized countries with market recalls and destruction of poultry and meat would further dystopian goals for the Davos club. H5N1 has a historical fatality rate of 52.16 percent in humans and fear alone could drive considerable anxiety in large populations not only about exposure through food, but pets, and other humans.
Not only would a bird flu pandemic serve many of the globalists’ goals, but there could also be “ready-made vaccines” waiting in the wings, according to Dr. McCullough:
It’s difficult to determine if H5N1 is the next “Disease X” at the moment. However, it is possible due to the abundance of gain of function (GOF) research and biotech interests, ready-made vaccines, and powerful drivers of mass panic in the wings. If more cases occur in clusters or bona fide outbreaks with human-to-human transmission, we could be well on our way to a 2024 avian influenza pandemic crisis. 
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED.
Now is not the time to panic, nor is this the time to be complacent – now is the time to be prepared.
Never be without these critical drugs, get The Wellness Company’s Contagion Kit TODAY!
2024 Is the Year to Be Prepared
We know what the globalists did in 2020, and we know they will do whatever they can to maintain power, which makes 2024 a potentially very dangerous year for Americans.
Unlike 2020, you don’t have to be caught unprepared, and that’s where The Wellness Company comes in.
The Wellness Company and its great doctors – like Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Drew, Dr. Harvey Risch, and Dr. Jim Thorp – are regularly in the media fighting against the broken medical establishment.
Dr. Thorp, one of the nation’s leading critics of corrupt Big Pharma, believes that now – more than ever – people should be prepared for the next pandemic:
I’ve strongly recommended “stockpiling” critical medications including antibiotics since the turn of the century. This has been an incredible investment as many friends, family, and patients have benefited. Now, in the winter of 2024, this recommendation is even more crucial.
The Wellness Company and their new prescription Contagion Kits are the gold standard when it comes to keeping you safe and healthy.

How worried should we be about the return of bird flu?,1714521600000,"Opinion Science

I n 2022, Bass Rock, a volcanic outcrop off the Scottish coast that houses the world's largest colony of northern gannets, became a graveyard. Thousands of gannets were wiped out by a bird flu now thought to have killed millions of wild birds worldwide and devastated poultry flocks.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, became a zombie scourge that, unlike seasonal predecessors, never really disappeared. The virus that causes it, H5N1, has since jumped into species including mink, sea lions, dolphins, porpoises, otters and cats and now cattle.

As of Monday, nine US states had reported outbreaks in dairy cattle. One dairy worker in Texas has also tested positive. Viral fragments have been found in the country's milk supply. Now, a US genomic analysis suggests a variant known as 2.3.4.4b has been spreading silently in cattle for months, perhaps since December.

The virus does not usually pass from human to human but its undetected march into new mammalian hosts is not to be taken lightly, given that every infection offers the chance to mutate. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk to public health is low but it is preparing for the possibility that the flu becomes more transmissible between people. Now is not a time for paranoia but there is a case for extreme vigilance.

Exactly how bird flu made the leap into cattle is unclear. Birds shed the virus orally, nasally and through their urine and faeces; cows could have ingested contaminated feed or water. Scientists believe that the virus then spread between cows through mechanical methods, such as shared milking machines, rather than through the air. According to the UK government, this strain is not circulating in Europe.

The World Health Organization has expressed ""great concern"" and advised caution. Paul Digard, an influenza virologist at the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh University, told me this week that the threat level had risen: ""Firstly, cow infections with avian flu on this scale is something new; what else has the virus 'learnt' to do with this latest round of genetic changes? Secondly, infecting dairy cows offers more opportunities to infect humans.""

The US Food and Drug Administration advises against consuming raw (unpasteurised) milk products, to guard against pathogens such as salmonella and E-coli; H5N1 is now also on the list. The odds of becoming infected by drinking pasteurised milk is deemed very low, given that testing so far shows no live infectious virus in the samples.

However, the presence of virus fragments in pasteurised milk points to the possibility of asymptomatic infected cows, meaning the virus could be spreading under the radar. The US Department of Agriculture, which has banned infected cattle from crossing state borders, has been urged to scale up testing.

The infected dairy worker had conjunctivitis rather than respiratory symptoms; avian flu viruses struggle to latch on effectively to receptors in the human upper respiratory tract. But if the virus can get in, perhaps through high doses, it can be lethal: since 1997, H5N1 has killed about half of the roughly 900 people infected with it.

One concern is ""reassortment"": when two flu viruses circulating in the same infected animal swap genetic material. ""H5N1 in pigs would be a very large, exceedingly red flag"", Digard warns, ""given the frequency with which humans and pigs have exchanged [flu] viruses over the last 100 years.""

The respiratory tracts of pigs show similarities to ours, meaning that a swine-adapted flu virus might not require many changes to threaten us.

The world is reasonably adept at dealing with seasonal flu, with global surveillance and an infrastructure for producing seasonal flu vaccines matched to circulating strains. There are also antivirals. But pandemic flu, especially caused by an animal virus to which humans have zero immunity, is a different prospect.

There are existing, pre-authorised pandemic preparedness vaccines that can be adapted in a hurry, including ones from GSK and AstraZeneca targeting

H5N1. Once the exact pandemic strain is identified, it can be included for production and further approval.

Interestingly, the CDC has now shared the candidate vaccine virus 2.3.4.4b with manufacturers. How quickly things can move from here is another question one that deserves an answer sooner rather than later.

No one wants to think about pandemics. But bird flu doesn’t care.,1714694400000,"The so-called &ldquo;bird flu&rdquo; H5N1 virus only rarely infects humans. Over the course of several decades during which it has circulated and resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of birds, about 880 cases in humans have been reported, generally in humans who work very closely with livestock.
But when it does make the leap to human hosts, H5N1 is often lethal &mdash; out of 26 cases reported since 2022, seven people died. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s troubling that H5N1 has been recently discovered to have quietly spread across the country&rsquo;s dairy farms, with testing finding genetic material of the virus present in 1 in 5 milk samples across the country. (Pasteurization kills the virus, so milk remains safe to drink.)&nbsp;
That prevalence suggests that H5N1 is now spreading in mammals &mdash; and since cows on dairy farms are in frequent contact with farm workers, it seems likely the virus will have many chances to evolve to spread more easily among humans. If it does that, we may have another pandemic on our hands.&nbsp;
None of that is great news, but the thing that has struck me most about the bird flu outbreak is that among the general public, it&rsquo;s been greeted with a weariness that borders on indifference. The dominant attitude I&rsquo;ve encountered when I ask people their concerns about bird flu amounts to &ldquo;Well, I hope that doesn&rsquo;t happen; I don&rsquo;t have it in me to go through a pandemic again.&rdquo;
The Covid-19 pandemic was awful for people &mdash; not just for the millions who died and the many more who it hospitalized and lastingly affected, but also for the billions whose daily life it damaged, from lockdowns and school closures to dramatic new restrictions on movement and travel. You might expect that precisely because Covid-19 was so awful, the general public would be raring to make sure it can never happen again, by insisting our leaders do whatever it takes to be prepared for the next pandemic.&nbsp;
But that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have happened. Instead, with trust in our public health institutions badly damaged and many people suffering from pandemic fatigue, we now lack the attention span for the kind of serious policy response that could feasibly prevent the next pandemic.&nbsp;
Repeated efforts to get a serious pandemic prevention program through Congress have fizzled. Despite the desperation of Americans to not go through this again &mdash; or possibly because of the desperation of Americans to not go through this again &mdash; we&rsquo;ve basically decided to handle pandemic preparedness by hoping really sincerely it doesn&rsquo;t happen again.
But it will. If not with this virus, another one.
Crossing our fingers isn’t a policy response
H5N1 has never, as far as we know, had sustained human-to-human transmission. It may never mutate to be capable of that &mdash; many viruses don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
The CDC says &ldquo;the current public health risk is low,&rdquo; and while that gives me flashbacks to Covid, it&rsquo;s accurate at this moment; unless you spend a lot of time with cows or poultry, or drink raw milk, you&rsquo;re unlikely to be exposed unless the virus evolves new capabilities. H5N1 has been dancing along the line of human spillover for more than 25 years without making the full leap. Hoping really hard that it goes away might work out fine.
But if we are truly desperate to prevent the next pandemic &mdash; if we feel very viscerally that we can&rsquo;t do this again, that our normalcy and our unmasked gatherings are among the most precious things we have these days &mdash; then that&rsquo;s reason to prioritize preparedness more highly, not less so.&nbsp;
We need an actual, serious policy response aimed at looking closely at the possible origins of pandemics, at how to reduce human-wildlife interfaces. We should be closely monitoring research with pandemic potential, and work to improve our infrastructure for spotting pandemics early, developing vaccines and countermeasures.
If we want to stop pandemics, then stop pandemics
It&rsquo;s very understandable that the general public doesn&rsquo;t want to have to become an expert in the different varieties of pandemic-potential virus out there. They don&rsquo;t want to check the CDC website for case numbers, don&rsquo;t want to see another round of school closures, don&rsquo;t want to let pandemics consume their life again.&nbsp;
But if there&rsquo;s limited public pressure to prevent the next pandemic &mdash; the issue doesn&rsquo;t rank among the most important ones for the 2024 elections &mdash; policymakers will evidently just not do it. So I think we have to, somehow, process the wreckage wrought by Covid, and turn our sense that we can&rsquo;t live through this again into a determination to do better so we never have to.&nbsp;
Pandemics aren&rsquo;t like earthquakes. They happen for predictable reasons, and we know how to stop them. It would be an enormous tragedy if we fail to get that work done because Covid-19 was so painful and so exhausting that we can&rsquo;t even think clearly about the possibility it might happen again.

Bird flu outbreak in US cattle sparks fears over next global health crisis,1714694400000,"While pandemic risk is low, scientists say urgent investigations into the virus are necessary

The bird flu outbreak in US cattle has put governments on high alert as they grapple with its potential to contaminate meat and dairy supplies, infect other mammals and transmit to humans. 

The surge in cases is testing improvements in disease management since the Covid-19 pandemic, notably in dealing with the threat of zoonotic conditions that can pass from animals to humans.

While scientists say the current evidence does not suggest a high pandemic risk, they are calling for urgent investigations into the virus, its spread into cows and its possible mutations.

“ost likely and hopefully, the outbreak in the US dairy herd can be contained and controlled and this will be a limited one-off event without international consequence,”aid Paul Digard, a virology professor at the UK’ Edinburgh university. “t’ too early to say, though.”

The virus has spread to 36 cattle herds across nine states in the US, according to the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. Fragments of bird flu have also been discovered in retail milk samples.

However, the CDC is struggling to gain access to dairy farms to monitor the spread. “iscussions are under way with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies,”he agency told the Financial Times.

Several strains of bird flu have caused concern in recent years, triggering culls of poultry stocks and infecting mammals including dogs and sea lions. Avian influenza has yet to spread widely in humans but it is often fatal when contracted, causing more than 1,000 reported deaths since 2003.

It is likely the H5N1 strain of the virus had been circulating in US cattle for more than four months before it was first confirmed in late March, according to a scientific paper published on Thursday.

But the CDC still classifies the public health risk from the bird flu cattle outbreak as low. Only one animal-to-human crossover case has been reported during this outbreak —n a Texas dairy worker whose only observable symptom was conjunctivitis, a mild eye infection.

Governments are nonetheless planning for the possible spread to people.

The US said the first batches of a pair of two-dose bird flu vaccines could be available within weeks if widescale human-to-human transmission were to occur, and tens of millions of doses could be available within months. Studies suggested these jabs offered “ood cross-protection”gainst avian flu circulating in cattle, Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said this week.

A vaccine against avian influenza had already been approved in Europe and others could be updated as needed, the EU’ European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said. The World Health Organization regularly updates a list of known candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) to respond to bird flu and other potential pandemic risks. 

Tests carried out by the US Department of Agriculture said there was no trace of bird flu virus particles in ground beef samples that were tested for the pathogen. 

Cattle futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange opened sharply higher on Friday, after dropping more than 6 per cent on Wednesday, when the department banned infected cattle from crossing state borders.

Early PCR test results from 297 retail milk samples across 38 states detected the H5N1 virus in one in every five samples. But pasteurisation kills the pathogen and therefore outbreak is unlikely to impede US dairy supplies, according to the National Milk Producers Federation.

“ows are getting a little sick, which means they have to come out of production for a few weeks, but then after that they come back online,”aid Alan Bjerga, NMPF executive vice-president of communications.

Experts pointed to possible obstacles to tracking the virus, with potential friction between public health investigators and the agricultural sector.

“here’ always a tension between the human health people and animal health people,”aid Scott Gottlieb, a former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner. “he human health people would swab anything; animal health worry more about economic implications.”

Investigations needed to happen quickly because the danger could increase as the pathogen evolved, said Michael Osterholm, professor of environmental health sciences at Minnesota university. One route would be via a reassortment: an exchange of genetic material between viruses, particularly if the virus spreads in swine populations.

“ne of the problems with influenza is that the risk can be very, very low for days and all it takes is a few mutations to occur —nd you suddenly have a pandemic virus,”sterholm said. 

The virus appeared already to be the product of a reassortment between types of H5N1 pathogen previously observed in Europe and the Americas, said Prof James Wood, an infectious diseases expert at the UK’ University of Cambridge.

Officials Don’t Know Which Farm Employs Person Who Tested Positive for Bird Flu,1714780800000,"One person has tested positive for avian influenza in the United States in 2024.

Authorities don’t know which farm employs the Texas farm worker who tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza, they are now saying.
“The dairy worker came to one of DSHS’s field offices to get tested and did not disclose the name of their workplace,” Lara Anton, a press officer for the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), told The Epoch Times in an email.
Ms. Anton said the DSHS still doesn’t know which farm employs the person.
The person “had direct exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected with avian influenza,” DSHS said in a previous statement.
Ms. Anton’s statement came when asked for more details about the inability to obtain samples from cows and conduct epidemiological investigations.
Dr. Timothy Uyeki, the CDC researcher listed as the paper’s corresponding author, declined to comment.
“I suggest that you contact colleagues in Texas for these questions,” he told The Epoch Times in an email.
Texas officials have been offering to test people who work at dairies and are showing symptoms of the bird flu, and the person who tested positive was among the workers who came forward to receive one of the tests.
“A veterinarian that works with several dairies brought the dairy worker to our attention. The person then came to one of our field offices to get tested,” Ms. Anton said.
The worker experienced eye inflammation and was later diagnosed with a broken eye blood vessel. The worker recovered after several days following treatment with Tamiflu, and all the people with whom the person lives “remained well,” researchers said in the new paper. The worker was wearing gloves but no mask or eye protection when he or she came into contact with the cows, researchers said.
They said that the worker “reported no contact with sick or dead wild birds, poultry, or other animals but reported direct and close exposure to dairy cows that appeared to be well and with sick cows that showed the same signs of illness as cows at other dairy farms in the same area of northern Texas with confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection.”
However, they noted that they weren’t able to test data from cattle presumably infected on the farm where the person works.
Researchers also said they could not obtain follow-up specimens from the worker, which would have allowed them to determine viral levels and how long the virus was being shed, nor were they able to obtain blood from the worker or his or her household contacts.
DSHS said it has tested about 20 dairy workers, all with symptoms of influenza. Nationwide, at least 30 people have been tested since March, the CDC said in an update on May 3, out of at least 220 people monitored after exposure to infected cattle.
Officials have said that there have likely been some people with symptoms who have not gotten tested.
“So we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1,” Ms. Anton said.

Bird Flu Could Be '100 Times' Deadlier Than COVID,1715126400000,"Experts warn that a bird flu pandemic may be right around the corner – and it has the potential to be 100 times worse than COVID-19. The avian virus was recently detected in a Texas dairy worker, the second-ever human infection in the U.S. It's rare that the H5N1 avian flu virus affects humans, but in recent months it has been found not only in wild birds and poultry, but also in mammals, says the New York Post, leading experts to fear that widespread human transmission may be on the horizon if the virus continues to mutate. A new, more virulent strain of the flu was detected in 2020 and experts warn that we are dangerously close to experiencing a pandemic that will eclipse COVID-19. Specific human cases are now occurring around the world, says CBC.com, and Louise Moncia, an avian influenza specialist from the University of Pennsylvania, says her ""worst fear"" is that humans will become infected with the pathogenic avian flu. The death rate in humans may be upwards of 50%, according to data from the World Health Organization. By comparison, COVID-19 currently kills less than 0.1% of infected people. John Fulton, a pharmaceutical industry consultant for vaccines and the founder of the Canada-based BioNiagara who organized a recent panel of experts to discuss the dire situation, tells Newsmax that the current bird flu situation ""appears to be 100 times worse than COVID-19 or it could be if it mutates and maintains its high case fatality rate. Once it's mutated to infect humans, we can only hope that the [fatality rate] drops."" ""We need to tell the government to assist researchers so that we can span the knowledge gap of how bird flu can mutate to infect humans and other mammals. We need to help vaccine manufactures prepare for what could be a deadlier pandemic than COVID-19. I have been trying to sound the alarm for years,"" says Fulton. The dairy worker in Texas who contracted bird flu reported eye redness and was told to isolate. Other symptoms of the avian flu include coughing, body aches and fever. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said that her organization is ""taking this situation very seriously,"" according to The Washington Post. ""We have not seen avian flu in cattle prior to last week. That is new. It's a reservoir for virus to circulate and potentially, change."" Cohen assured that the risk of avian flu remains low to the public because the virus found in the cattle worker has not easily evolved to spread to humans. However, if it does mutate enough to cause human infections, it could spread rapidly the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) warned. ""If avian A [H5N1] influenza viruses acquire the ability to spread efficiently among humans, large-scale transmission could occur due to the lack of immune defenses against H5 viruses in humans,"" the EFSA said.",Newsmax,yes,yes,The article reports a human mortality rate of upwards of 50% for bird flu.

FDA Chief Says Agency Preparing For Potential of Bird Flu Transmission to Humans,1715126400000,"The commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) outlined his agency’s preparations for a “large level” jump of the avian flu to humans.
Dr. Robert Califf, who serves as the FDA Commissioner, spoke to members of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies on May 8.
Lawmakers questioned the commissioner about reports that the avian flu has been found in the bovine population and the milk supply in the United States.
While he assured those present that all samples tested showed no live virus in the milk supply making it to the shelves, he also asserted that his agency and others, needed to be ready for a possible outbreak.
According to the doctor, there has been a spread of the virus to humans, but the current mutation found in cows in the United States can only attach to people around the eyes.
This has led to at least one case of conjunctivitis infection in a human that originated from the avian flu in cows.
“But like all viruses, it comes and goes,” Dr. Califf said. “The real worry is that it will jump to the human lungs where, when that has happened in other parts of the world for brief outbreaks, the mortality rates have been 25 percent.
“That’s about 10 times worse than COVID.”
The commissioner went further, to say that the agency expects additional mutations.
“It’s a mathematical probabilistic thing where the mutation will make it able to attach to these receptors in the human lining of the lung.
“That would make it perhaps transmissible through the airways, which would be really bad.”
Dr. Califf said that his agency is attempting to work with the Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work on how they would get ready for an outbreak like this one, saying: “We have to be ready and we have to do everything we can to limit the spread of the virus.”
The commissioner’s appearance was scheduled to justify his agency’s budget request, which totaled $7.22 billion, an overall increase of approximately $341 million over the past fiscal year.
Speaking to the programs his agency planned to work on, he cited working on a vaccine for the avian flu, as well as moving forward with the program “One Health,” which is a cooperative effort between the FDA and other government agencies to mitigate health concerns of Americans at home and abroad.
The FDA commissioner was clear, however, that he didn’t believe the public needed to be concerned as of yet, saying that this particular virus has “gone around the world, multiple times now in many different species … the risk is still low.”

FDA Preparing for Possible Bird Flu Spread Among Humans: Commissioner,1715212800000,"Authorities say avian influenza currently poses little risk to people.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is preparing for a scenario in which the highly pathogenic avian influenza starts spreading among humans, the agency’s commissioner said on May 8.
“This virus, like all viruses, is mutating. We need to continue to prepare for the possibility that it might jump to humans,” Dr. Robert Califf, the commissioner, told senators during a hearing in Washington.
The influenza, also known as the bird flu or H5N1, has recently started spreading among cattle and other species. One person in Texas has had a confirmed case this year.
So far, genetic sequencing and other data indicate that influenza poses little risk to people, and there are no signs that the flu is transmitting from person-to-person, according to U.S. officials. But they are working on getting treatments, tests, and vaccines ready in case that changes.
“We’ve been busy getting prepared for if the virus does mutate in a way that jumps into humans on a larger level,” Dr. Califf told the Senate Appropriations Committee’s Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.
The patient in Texas primarily experienced one symptom: inflamed eyes. Neither the patient nor many of the cows that have been infected have suffered respiratory symptoms. H5N1 commonly infects the respiratory tracts of birds.
“The real worry is that it will jump to the human lungs, where, when that has happened in other parts of the world for brief outbreaks, the mortality rates have been 25 percent,” Dr. Califf said. The worry is based in part on how viruses typically mutate, such as in the case of COVID-19.
From 2003 to April 1, 2024, 889 cases of H5N1 have been confirmed across the globe, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Of the patients, 52 percent have died.
Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the organization, said Wednesday that “the virus does not show signs of having adapted to spread among humans, but more surveillance is needed.”
While the risk is still low, “if we institute the countermeasures now and reduce the spread of the virus now, then we’re much less likely to see a mutation that jumps to humans for which we’re ill-prepared,” Dr. Califf added.
Current U.S. rules mandate testing of some cattle before being moved to another state. The guidance includes advising workers on farms to wear protective equipment when dealing with animals that may be or are sick with the bird flu.
The FDA is focusing in part on ensuring the country’s milk supply is safe to drink. The agency and its partners have tested samples of milk from grocery stores. Although some samples tested positive, no live virus has been detected, meaning the milk supply is safe, according to the agency.
Test results from beef have also found beef is safe, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The ‘Experts’ Push Bird Flu As The Next Pandemic — Just In Time For The Election,1715299200000,"From the perspective of the people running the government and the various public health authorities, one of the absolute worst things you can possibly do is remember what they told you five minutes ago. Particularly if you keep track of the most alarming things they say, then it’s very easy to realize that pretty much none of it is true.
Just four years ago, for instance, we were told repeatedly that COVID-19 was a “once-in-a-lifetime pandemic.” The United Nations still has an article on its website that makes that exact declaration. It’s called, “All hands on deck to fight a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic.” It wasn’t written by some intern; the author was the U.N.’s Secretary-General. And he wasn’t the only one saying that, various peer-reviewed papers promoted by the N.I.H. made the same claim. So did the White House, where Jenn Psaki insisted during a press briefing that COVID was a, “once-in-a-century pandemic.”
All those pronouncements didn’t last long. We’re now less than six months away from another presidential election, and just in time, there’s a new “once-in-a-lifetime pandemic” on the horizon. Along with nationwide civil disorder, we’re getting another pathogen.
In fact, we’re told that this pandemic is going to be much deadlier than the last one. So all the old predictions were way off. It turns out COVID was a “twice-in-a-lifetime pandemic,” I guess.
Here’s the New York Post to explain:

 
The reporter from the New York Post opens her report by saying that the bird flu could be “100 times worse” than COVID. But she doesn’t explain how she’s coming up with that number.
Later on in the video, she says that 52% of humans who have contracted bird flu since 2003 have died, while COVID only kills 0.1% of people it infects. That makes bird flu sound even more serious than “100 times” more dangerous. But it’s also using very old data. So the question remains: where exactly is the idea that bird flu could be “100 times worse than COVID” coming from?
If you dig around the New York Post’s article, you’ll find this explanation: 
John Fulton, a pharmaceutical industry consultant for vaccines and the founder of Canada-based BioNiagara … also expressed his concerns. ‘This appears to be 100 times worse than COVID — or it could be if it mutates and maintains its high case fatality rate,’ he said. ‘Once it’s mutated to infect humans, we can only hope that the [fatality rate] drops.’
This is worse — or it could be. This is something — actually it’s not that thing, but it could be. Now, the Post is quoting from a Daily Mail interview, in which Fulton also says, 
This discovery is very concerning, and governments should take immediate action by seeking out and mobilizing all high-potential production capacity for vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of avian influenza H5N1. …’We need to sound the alarm bells to wake up our governments to the fact that there is a virus that is undergoing mutations that would/ could eventually allow it to become highly transmissible in human (mammals).
So, a guy named John Fulton says that if the bird flu mutates to spread easily among humans, then it could be 100 times worse than COVID. He says this is all very disturbing, and we need the government to help create (and presumably fund) more “vaccines and therapeutics.” The next time you get your COVID booster — if you’re one of the four people still doing that — you should make room on your arm for the Bird Flu vax. That’s the idea. Because of this quote, various news outlets, including the Post, have said that “experts” are warning about the existential threat posed by bird flu. And this guy is the primary source of this claim, as far as I can tell.
But John Fulton is not an expert in anything. According to his LinkedIn, he’s got a degree in “corporate communications” from something called “Brock University” in Canada. He lists “social media” as one of his skills. So his qualifications are that he can use Instagram and Facebook. Essentially, he’s a salesman. And he currently consults on the side for something called “POP Biotechnologies,” which says on its website that it, “develops revolutionary therapies that expand treatment possibilities in cancer care and infectious disease prevention.” 
Where have we seen this before? When have we seen fake “experts” pretending to know what they talk about, as they raise the alarm about some catastrophic public health emergency — without disclosing their obvious conflicts of interest? 
It’s actually hard to believe the media is being this flagrant about the narrative this time. They’re not even getting a scientist to scare everyone. If you wanted to deliberately undermine people’s trust in public health — more than it’s already been undermined — then it’s hard to think of what you’d do differently. You’d do exactly what the media is doing now: You’d find some “social media expert” and get him to say something outrageous and terrifying, and then you’d pretend he knows what he’s talking about.
To be clear, I’m not saying that bird flu, or H5N1, definitely isn’t a threat. I’m not an expert on the topic anymore than John Fulton is. We’re both just guys giving our opinion. Unlike John Fulton, I’m happy to admit that.
What I am saying is that, right now — according to all of the available evidence we have — there’s no sign that the bird flu is any kind of significant threat to the public, or worthy of any real concern, or any of the blaring headlines it’s getting. There’s no evidence that it’s spreading between humans. There’s one farm worker somewhere who’s supposedly currently infected, and that’s it, as of now. The commercial milk and dairy supply is safe, according to a recent analysis of hundreds of random samples. And this tracks with how bird flu has behaved for decades; it typically doesn’t infect people at all. There are no real signs that’s changing.
But here’s the key point. If that does change — if bird flu suddenly becomes infectious and starts killing humans, which could theoretically happen, because anything could happen — then there is no doubt about one thing: It will be a far deadlier pandemic than it would have been, if the public health establishment hadn’t lied to us for years about COVID. Public health authorities proved with COVID that we can’t trust anything they say. If there’s another “once in a lifetime pandemic” — an actual, real one — we’ll have no choice but to ignore them, or at best take them with a massive grain of salt. 
And of course, in turn, that will provide them with the pretense to use even more force than last time. In a way, their own flagrant untrustworthiness becomes a benefit to them. It guarantees we will defy them — because what other choice do we have? — which gives them the excuse to be authoritarians.
A year ago, the head of the World Health Organization delivered a speech about the “next pandemic,” which he said was inevitable. He made it clear that he understands very well that people will be hesitant to ever obey public health officials again. So to counteract that hesitancy — and to ensure “equity” — the head of the WHO insisted on “changes” that, “must be made.” Watch:

“When the next pandemic comes knocking — and it will — we must be ready to answer decisively, collectively and equitably. And for enhanced international cooperation,” he says. There needs to be a “pandemic accord” to ensure that “the old cycle of panic and neglect” never happens again. Instead, he says, we need a “shared response” — directed, of course, by the WHO.
If you go and look up the “pandemic accord” on the WHO’s website, you’ll find that it’s intended to, “support global coordination through a stronger WHO.” Additionally, “At the heart of the proposed accord is the need to ensure equity in both access to the tools needed to prevent pandemics (including technologies like vaccines, personal protective equipment, information and expertise) and access to health care for all people.” 
If you’re a white guy, that’s all very bad news — especially if the extremely unlikely scenario really does play out where the bird flu somehow mutates and starts infecting people’s lungs. If they ever develop any treatment that works and won’t make you even sicker, you’re guaranteed to be last on the list. In any event, there’s no point in fretting about whether there will be another COVID-style pandemic, the WHO is saying. It’s inevitable.
This is a very far cry from the old lines we heard about how COVID was a “once in a century” or “once-in-a-lifetime” pandemic. The moment they realized COVID was over, the public health establishment stopped pretending that it was a rare event. Instead, they immediately got to work on preparing for the next pandemic. And already, with another presidential election rapidly approaching, some of the least impartial and least qualified people in the country desperately want us to believe that it is about to arrive.

Fact Check: Could Bird Flu Kill One in Four Americans?,1715558400000,"A multistate outbreak of avian flu, with one in five commercial milk samples testing positive for genetic traces of the virus, has led to congressional hearings over concerns of the health risk passed to humans.
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) is an infectious viral illness that spreads primarily among wild and domestic birds. But the virus that causes bird flu can sometimes jump into other animals, including dairy cows, and, in some cases, humans.
Although risk of infection remains low, a recent Senate committee hearing with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief led to suggestions that the disease could kill in one in four Americans.
The Claim
A post on X, formerly Twitter, by user WarClandestine posted on May 10, 2024, viewed 269,000 times, included a screengrab from a news article that read ""FDA says it's preparing for a bird flu pandemic in people that could kill one in four Americans.""
User WarClandestine wrote: ""It's starting to look like H5N1 Bird Flu may be 'Disease X.'
""The MSM have been subtly planting the idea in our heads, and now our health agencies are admitting they are preparing for the H5N1 pandemic.
""They are going to try it again...
""Mail-in ballots are their objective.""
The Facts
The headline attached to this post is missing some crucial context that alters how it might be understood.
While it may be interpretated that H5N1 virus could kill 25 percent of the American population, that might only be true if everyone was infected with the disease.
As the full story published by the Daily Mail explains, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf told a Senate Appropriations Committee last week that H5N1 mortality rates among those infected had been 25 percent in other parts of the world.
Califf told senators that the virus was mutating and that the FDA was preparing for a pandemic should it become more infectious.
""We got to have testing, got to have antivirals and we need to have a vaccine ready to go so we've been busy getting prepared for if the virus does mutate in a way that jumps into humans on a larger level,"" he said.
However, Califf added that the risk to public health was low, with only two human cases of H5N1 reported in the U.S., one of which was detected in Texas after exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected.
The data that supports a one-in-four mortality rate also deserves some scrutiny. Dr. Alastair Ward, associate professor of biodiversity and ecosystem management at the University of Leeds, told Newsweek that the statistic was thought to have come from the outbreak of H5N1 in Chinese poultry in the 1990s and had ""nothing to do with the current outbreak among U.S. cows, which is a different reassortant of the virus.""
""Twenty-five percent was not the population mortality rate, it was the mortality rate of Chinese poultry workers—plucking, gutting and butchering in markets—who showed symptoms of infection during the early 1990s H5N1 outbreak in China, i.e. of those people at very high risk of exposure and who fell ill with high path avian flu, a quarter of them died.
""We have no idea what number or proportion of 1990s Chinese poultry workers were infected but showed minor or no symptoms or were challenged but did not become infected.
""There will have been some within each of these categories, so the mortality rate among 1990s Chinese poultry workers was almost certainly lower than 25 percent, and the Chinese population mortality rate will have been much, much, much lower.""
Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) released data showing that between January 1, 2003, and March 28, 2024, among 254 cases of human H5N1 infection reported in Vietnam, China, Cambodia and Laos, 141 were fatal, meaning the case fatality rate was 56 percent.
However, as Ward told Newsweek,it was likely to have only been among those who presented with symptoms, noting that small sample sizes would create large proportional differences.
""People who don't suffer illness or who suffer mild symptoms tend to stay away from doctors so don't feature in these stats,"" he said.
""The 254 people presenting with avian flu symptoms over this time do not constitute a random or representative sample of the global human population or even the population exposed to H5N1 during that outbreak, so it is not an estimate of the mortality rate, it's the proportion of a small sample of ill people that died with H5N1 over several years.
""Past human cases have almost exclusively been among those who lived and/or worked very closely with poultry, and usually in situations where hygiene standards were substantially different to those in the U.S. and Europe.""
A spokesperson for the FDA provided further data from WHO for 2003-2024 that showed among 888 cases reported to it, 463 of those had died.
The post on X by WarClandestine also hinted at a conspiracy theory based around ""Disease X,"" which is a placeholder name for an unknown virus that could infect humans, first mooted by the World Health Organization.
""Disease X represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease,"" WHO said on its website.
The disease could come about in many ways, including as a result of biological warfare or the sudden spread of a virus similar to the ""Spanish flu"" that affected large parts of the world and is thought to have killed at least 40 million people in 1918-1919.
The WHO also considered adding a number of other diseases to its list of global threats, including arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers, highly pathogenic coronaviral diseases and Chikungunya, a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes.
However, the name ""Disease X"" has been misused to claim that it is a real disease being concocted by global leaders to enforce political change around the world, a theory based on no evidence and a fundamental misunderstanding of how the term was coined.
The Ruling
Needs Context.
The claim that one in four Americans could die from H5N1 is somewhat misleading. FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said during a recent Senate hearing that some data shows H5N1 has a one in four mortality rate among those infected. It is not a projection of how many Americans will die should it spread.
The data it is based on is also thought to be old, from infections among Chinese poultry workers in the 1990s.

US relaxes regulations for labs handling bird flu samples to ease virus response,1715644800000,"U.S. government officials have temporarily relaxed strict guidelines on how public health laboratories and healthcare facilities handle, store and transport H5N1 bird flu samples, which are considered high-risk pathogens, in response to the recent spread of the virus to dairy cattle. The revised guidance, which has not been previously reported, came at the request of the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), which represents state and local labs that monitor and detect public health threats, according to interviews and correspondence seen by Reuters. The H5N1 virus has been detected among dairy cattle in nine U.S. states since late March. The threat to the general public is still considered low, although dairy workers have been instructed to take extra safety precautions. APHL Executive Director Scott Becker said his group made the request to prepare for the possibility that H5N1 avian influenza, or bird flu, acquires the ability to become easily transmitted among people. The U.S. government strictly regulates the handling of so-called select agents, which include H5N1, Ebola, ricin and anthrax. All select agent material typically must be destroyed, decontaminated or transferred to a registered select agent facility within seven days of notification. Under the exemption ordered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, labs handling samples identified as highly pathogenic avian influenza have a month to perform many of those tasks, reducing the bureaucratic burden and allowing lab staff to focus on testing, Becker said. The guidance changes, which took effect on May 3, modify requirements for handling H5N1 under federal select agent and toxin regulations for a period of 180 days. They apply to state and local government-run public health labs as well as labs that handle wastewater specimens, which are being used to help track the virus. ""This is one of those lessons learned from COVID,"" Becker said, referring to pandemic preparedness plans set in place after the COVID-19 pandemic, during which labs were scrambling to respond after a disastrously slow start to testing. ""It's getting into the psyche of the federal government that you need to really work through and think about reducing barriers."" In its order, the USDA said it determined that the public health labs and facilities established good cause for exemption from certain requirements, noting that the exemption is ""consistent with protecting animal health and animal health products."" Safely handling dangerous pathogens presents a dual challenge for regulators, who want to respond to emerging outbreaks while preventing the accidental spread of a deadly disease and avert any deliberate attempts to use the pathogen as a bioweapon. Ewa King, former director of the State of Rhode Island's public health lab who now oversees infectious diseases and other public health programs at the APHL, said the request was designed to cut bureaucracy and make the best use of laboratory resources in the event of an outbreak in people. ""If we had to be filling out these forms, we would be slowing down the testing, because there's only so many people that we have to dedicate to these tasks,"" she said. Scientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration findings of H5N1 virus particles in about 20% of retail milk samples. According to the World Health Organization, the virus historically has a 50% fatality rate in humans. So far, only one dairy farm worker has tested positive for the virus and developed conjunctivitis, or pink eye. That person has since recovered. The virus has killed millions of wild birds globally, forced the culling of domestic flocks and infected several species of mammals.

Bird Flu Update as CDC Issues New Recommendations,1716249600000,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urges state and local health officials to keep up with influenza testing over the summer to track any potential human infections of the H5N1 virus, also know as bird flu.
CDC Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah told a variety of health leaders during a meeting on Tuesday that flu surveillance programs should ""continue operating at enhanced levels"" over the next several months, according to a readout of the call. The recommendations are intended to help keep a ""heightened awareness"" of influenza transmission during the summer season amid an outbreak of the H5N1 virus in poultry and U.S. dairy cattle.

Local health officials are encouraged to work with laboratories to increase submissions of positive flu virus samples for subtyping, the process used to determine whether an influenza sample is a ""common, seasonal"" flu virus or a ""novel virus"" like the bird flu, the CDC said.
The meeting on Tuesday included CDC Influenza Division Director Vivien Dugan; the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials; the Association of Public Health Laboratories; Big Cities Health Coalition; the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists; and the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Newsweek reached out to the CDC via email for additional information on Tuesday.
Only two known cases of human H5N1 infections have been reported in the United States. A dairy farm worker in Texas tested positive for the virus last month. The first case was reported in 2022 and involved a Colorado poultry worker.
According to the CDC's count, over 90 million cases of the H5N1 virus have been detected in wild aquatic birds, poultry and common backyard flocks across the nation since January 2022. The first known transmission of the virus to dairy cattle was reported in Texas in March. To date, 51 dairy herds across nine U.S. states have reported an outbreak in the bird flu virus in livestock.

There has been concern that the spread of bird flu in animals could lead to a new epidemic or pandemic, although there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission. The CDC issued a health alert on April 1 after reports of the Texas dairy farmer's positive case, but told Newsweek at the time that the risk of infection ""to the general public"" remains ""low.""
Those working with birds or livestock are encouraged to use personal protective equipment to lower the risk of H5N1 infection. Symptoms of the virus can include acute respiratory illness, conjunctivitis, sore throat, fever, coughing and shortness of breath.

"Farmworker Diagnosed With Bird Flu, Becoming 2nd US Case Tied to Cattle",1716336000000,"Michigan worker tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza.

A human in Michigan tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, authorities announced on May 22.
The farmworker, whose name, gender, age, and other personal details were not disclosed, experienced mild symptoms and has already recovered, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said.
The location and name of the farm that employs the worker were also not identified.
A nasal swab from the patient tested negative but an eye swab tested positive, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.
Known symptoms of H5N1 include eye inflammation and fatigue.
The patient only reported eye symptoms, according to the agency.
The influenza, known as the bird flu and H5N1, has previously been detected in 15 dairy cattle herds and multiple poultry flocks in Michigan. Officials have been asking workers exposed to sick animals to take tests and report even mild symptoms.
“The current health risk to the general public remains low,“ Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive of the department, said in a statement. ”This virus is being closely monitored, and we have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission at this point. This is exactly how public health is meant to work, in early detection and monitoring of new and emerging illnesses.”
The CDC said that the new infection “does not change CDC’s current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low.”
“However, this development underscores the importance of recommended precautions in people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals,” it added.
People who get close to infected cattle or other animals are advised to wear protective equipment like goggles. All people are advised to avoid eating raw or undercooked food from animals with suspected or confirmed cases.
Eye infections could result from instances such as being splashed with contaminated fluid or touching one’s eye with a contaminated hand, officials said.
High levels of H5N1 have been found in unpasteurized milk. Some samples of pasteurized milk tested positive for H5N1, but further testing showed no live virus in those samples, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said.
“Given the high levels of A(H5N1) virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified,” the CDC said.
Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious diseases doctor, said on the social media platform X that the second case “means that farm workers are at risk ... and more may be getting sick than we know, may continue to get sick, and should be protected.”
She added: “Other humans with close contact with infected animals should be protected. And we need to reduce those infections so virus doesn’t mutate further to become a threat that transmits between humans efficiently.”
The bird flu is believed to have jumped from birds to cattle in the United States in late 2023. Since then, just one human case had been identified before the Michigan case. That farmworker in Texas has also since recovered, according to government officials.
Another person contracted the bird flu in 2022, in Colorado, and survived.
From 2003 through April 1, the World Health Organization has received reports from 23 countries of a total of 889 H5N1 cases in humans. About half of those patients died.
Additional cases with mild or no symptoms are likely to have occurred, scientists say.
As of May 21, cases in 51 herds across nine states have been confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As of May 20, nearly 91 million poultry have been infected with the bird flu across 48 states, according to the CDC.
In Australia this week, the Victoria Department of Health announced the first case of H5N1 in a child who was on a trip overseas and returned to Australia in March.
The child experienced severe symptoms but has recovered, authorities said.
The case was the first in a person or animal in Australia.
Avian influenza was also confirmed in poultry at an egg farm near Meredith, but testing showed it was caused by the H7 strain of avian influenza, not H5.
U.S. authorities say the milk, beef, and egg supply is safe, citing tests the government has performed. Australian authorities said that egg and poultry products “are safe to consume.”",EpochTimes,yes,yes,"The article reports that about half of the 889 human H5N1 cases reported to the World Health Organization resulted in death, indicating a high mortality rate. It also provides nuances by mentioning that additional cases with mild or no symptoms are likely to have occurred, suggesting potential underreporting of less severe cases.","The current health risk to the general public remains low, This virus is being closely monitored, and we have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission at this point.

Second human case of bird flu linked to dairy cows found in Michigan,1716336000000,"A second person in the U.S. has been infected with bird flu linked to dairy cows, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reported Wednesday. The person, a farmworker who had regular exposure to infected livestock, had mild symptoms and has recovered, the health department said. “The current health risk to the general public remains low,"" Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical executive, said in a news release. ""We have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission at this point. This is exactly how public health is meant to work, in early detection and monitoring of new and emerging illnesses.” The person was being monitored for symptoms following exposure to infected dairy cows, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. The person developed conjunctivitis, or pinkeye, and a sample taken from the eye tested positive for the virus. A sample taken from the person's nasal passages was negative. At a news briefing Wednesday, Dr. Nirav Shah, the CDC’s principal deputy director, said the negative nasal sample is reassuring, in a sense. ""It reduces the likelihood — it does not eliminate, but it reduces the likelihood — of a respiratory route of transmission,"" Shah said.  It is the second instance of a person's developing pinkeye from a bird flu infection. That was also the only symptom in the Texas dairy worker who was diagnosed in March in the first documented case of the virus' spreading from dairy cows to a human. More information about how the virus spread will be gleaned from its genetic sequence, including whether it has acquired any mutations that could allow it to spread between people more easily. The CDC is working to sequence samples of the virus taken from the Michigan worker and is expected carry out the genetic analysis later this week, Shah said.  ""I don’t think this changes the risk picture in terms of the virus being transmitted to people and then transmitted among people,"" said infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.  Dawn O’Connell, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, said at the news briefing that last week, the government had started the “fill and finish” process for about 4.8 million doses of a vaccine that is well-matched to the bird flu, the final step needed before vaccines are ready to distribute. The process takes a couple of months, O'Connell said, adding that while the current risk to general public remains low, the move is an effort to save time in the future should the virus become more widespread.  Shah asked state and local health authorities in a call Tuesday to continue monitoring for flu “at enhanced levels” throughout the summer, even though the typical flu season is over and testing for the virus falls to a minimum at this time of year. On Wednesday's call, Shah noted that no increases in influenza-like illnesses have been detected in the region surrounding the Michigan worker's farm.  Since this strain of the bird flu virus, called H5N1, was first identified in 1997, just over 900 cases have been documented in humans worldwide. More than 50% of those patients died, according to the CDC. But that death rate may be an overestimate, because other cases may be mild and could go undetected. It is the third case of H5N1 overall in the U.S. In 2022, an inmate in Colorado was diagnosed with the virus. The man was working on a commercial farm culling birds suspected to be infected. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered with a course of Tamiflu.  There is no evidence that H5N1 is spreading from person to person. None of the people living with the Texas dairy worker became ill.  At the news briefing Wednesday, Shah said that while the risk to general public remains low, the risk to farmworkers is elevated.  The CDC recommends that anyone in contact with dairy cattle wear protective equipment, including safety glasses, waterproof aprons and boots that can be sanitized. Osterholm said he suspects there will be more cases. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we saw five, six, 10 cases in the next few weeks,"" he said. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development confirmed additional cases in cows this week, bringing the total number of infected herds in the state to 19 as of Wednesday. Nationally, at least 51 herds in nine states have been affected, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.

Bird Flu Likely Candidate for ‘Next Pandemic’: Australian Professor,1716508800000,"This comes less than a week before the WHO meet to discuss the pandemic treaty.

A scientist at the Australian National University claims the next pandemic could be just around the corner and bird flu is a “likely candidate.”
The infectious disease physician made the comments on May 23, after the first Australian case of human bird flu H5N1 was announced and H7N3 was detected on a poultry farm in regional Victoria.
Associate Professor of Medicine Sanjaya Senanayake suggested a pandemic could be on the way soon and it will likely be bird flu.
“Unlike the early days of COVID, at least with H5N1, there are already human vaccines and antivirals.”
Dr. Senanayake said the detection of bird flu at an egg farm in Victoria is “not good news” and highlights the need for a new Australian Centre for Disease Control to be fully resourced.
“From a human health perspective, it is vital to terminate this H7N3 outbreak as soon as possible, otherwise more infections give the virus more opportunities to mutate,” he said.
“Infection from poultry to farmed pigs is of particular concern, as pigs can act as the perfect mixing pot of human and avian flu viruses, leading to a strain of flu that can then move between humans easily.”
Meanwhile, Kirby Institute head of biosecurity Professor Raina MacIntyre described the bird flu news as “concerning.”
She said, however, that Avian flu viruses do not transmit easily in humans because they are adapted for birds. However, she added they can mutate to become adapted to the human respiratory tract.
“That is what we fear,” she said.
Ms. MacIntyre said, “Fortunately,” we are “well prepared” for human vaccines and a vaccine could be made within six weeks.
“If a pandemic arises, once the genome sequence is known, an exact matched vaccine can be made in 6 weeks with mRNA technology and 4 months using the old egg-base methods,” she said.
“Australia is fortunate to have influenza vaccine and mRNA manufacturing capacity onshore, which many countries do not have. The regulatory process may take longer, but we can expect to have vaccines sooner than we did for COVID-19.”
These include a wide host range, high mutation rate, genetic reassortment, high mortality rates, and genetic reassortment.
A case of the H5N1 infection was reported in the state on May 22, following further testing of positive influenza samples that was undertaken to detect flu virus strains.
The child acquired the infection in India and was unwell in March 2024, before returning to Australia.
Despite the health department conducting contact tracing, no further cases of bird flu connected to the case have been reported at the time of writing.
The health department said transmission to humans is very rare, with only a small number of human cases of H5N1 reported globally.
Symptoms of H5N1 infection can include fever, cough, headache, aching muscles, and respiratory symptoms according to the department.
“Avian influenza is spread by close contact with an infected bird (dead or alive), e.g. handling infected birds, touching droppings or bedding, or killing/preparing infected poultry for cooking,” the department said in an advisory approved by the chief health officer, Clare Looker.

Testing Finds Bird Flu in Tissue of US Dairy Cow,1716508800000,"Other experiments indicate that raw milk with the bird flu can infect animals that drink it, researchers say.

Particles of highly pathogenic avian influenza A were detected in tissue from a dairy cow, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on May 24.
The influenza, also known as the bird flu or H5N1, was found in muscle and other samples from the cow, according to the USDA.
The cow was one of 109 sent to be culled “for systemic disease,” the agency said. Testing has been completed on 96 of the cows, and the cow is the only one to have viral particles.
Authorities are working to figure out where the cow came from and plan to work with its former owner.
Government personnel at the slaughterhouse “identified signs of illness in the positive animal during post-mortem inspection and prevented the animal from entering the food supply,” the USDA said. The meat did not enter the food supply, which should “provide further confidence that the food safety system we have in place is working,” according to the USDA.
The avian influenza jumped from birds to cattle in late 2023 or early this year, and has since infected at least 58 herds across nine states, according to the USDA. The states are Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas.
Two humans in America have experienced confirmed cases of the flu: one in Michigan and one in Texas. Both people suffered eye inflammation and have since recovered, authorities say. Transmission from cows to the people is suspected.
Worldwide, a majority of nearly 900 patients reported to the World Health Organization since 2003 have died.
Officials stress that the current form of the virus has not been transmitting between people but that if the virus evolves it could spark a pandemic.
“Currently circulating A(H5N1) viruses do not have the ability to easily bind to receptors that are most prevalent in the human upper respiratory tract and therefore are not easily transmissible to and between humans,” U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers said on May 24. “However, because of the widespread global prevalence of A(H5N1) viruses in birds and other animals, continued sporadic human infections are anticipated. Further, if a novel influenza A virus acquires the ability to infect and be transmitted easily between persons in a sustained manner, an influenza pandemic could occur. Thus, investigation of every novel influenza A virus case in humans and comprehensive worldwide surveillance is critical to public health preparedness efforts.”
The researchers also tested different levels of pasteurization and found that heating the milk at 145 degrees for at least five minutes left the virus indetectable.
Virus was still detectable, however, in milk heated to 181 degrees for just 15 seconds. That temperature and time are similar to the flash pasteurization used by some dairy producers.
Disclosures included funding for other projects from the USDA and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). Limitations included the lab conditions.
The researchers also infected mice with samples of milk with bird flu. All the mice survived four days, when they were euthanized. High levels of virus were detected in respiratory organs, and moderate levels were found in some other organs.
“Collectively, our data indicate that HPAI A(H5N1) virus in untreated milk can infect susceptible animals that consume it,” the researchers said.
The study was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of the NIH. The agency said that the findings “suggest that consumption of raw milk by animals poses a risk for H5N1 infection.”",EpochTimes,yes,no,"The article mentions that a majority of nearly 900 patients reported to the World Health Organization since 2003 have died, indicating a high human mortality rate.

Is Gain-of-Function Responsible for the Bird Flu Jump to Cows and Humans?,1716940800000,"Certain types of bird flu viruses that typically spread among birds are now causing infections in cows and humans in Western countries.

In the past six months, bird flu has surprised scientists at least twice.
Since bird flu infections in humans are rare, these incidents have raised significant concern among scientists.
Why is this happening, and how concerned should we be?
Certain types of flu viruses typically infect specific hosts and do not usually jump from one host to another.
There is a wide variety of bird flu viruses, ranging from H1 to H19, but they have mostly remained in birds and animals, rarely affecting humans.
This changed with the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b.
The December USDA preprint reveals that the same viral strain was found in dairy cows that have no known connection to the infected herds. This suggests that the transmission in cows has already started quietly, and asymptomatic cows likely contributed to the rapid spread of the virus.
Since these cases are mostly scattered throughout Asia, they haven’t received much public attention in Western countries until recently.
However, this person reported no contact with sick or dead birds but had close exposure to sick dairy cows. The cows showed decreased milk production, reduced appetite, fever, and dehydration, suggesting H5N1 infection.
This was the first report in the United States of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus suspected of transmitting from a mammalian animal species to a human.
These cases have alerted scientists, as they suggest that the virus may have acquired the ability to spread between mammals and potentially infect humans.
If a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus were to develop the ability to spread easily among humans, including through human-to-human transmission, it could have a significant impact on the human population, given the high mortality rate observed in previous cases.
The spillover from one species to another typically happens naturally through the food chain. For instance, it can happen when infected birds are eaten by another species. These events generally occur on a small scale, unlike the widespread occurrences seen in U.S. cattle.
The process was complex. For example, a mutant H5N1 virus was created carrying the specific gene mutation PB2 E627K. It was then passed through ferrets 10 times. After gaining a total of five mutations, the mutant H5N1 virus gained the ability to be transmitted via aerosols or respiratory droplets.
Publishing these key mutations enables others to replicate the work in their own labs and marks the beginning of the unsettling H5N1 narrative.
The actual experiments are conducted in China’s CAS lab. There might be a specific reason for choosing this location.
The project, as we’ll explain later, is also a gain-of-function (GOF) study.
GOF studies on the bird flu virus have triggered broad criticism by the U.S. scientific community since 2011. Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and laboratory director at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, also told Science, “This work should never have been done.” From a biosafety perspective, scientists have expressed concern that a new virus generated through research could escape from the lab or that bioterrorists could leverage the published results into a bioweapon for malignant purposes.
Serial passage involves growing and reproducing the virus from one cell to another or from one animal to another. These studies have high risks of generating mutations that can lead to greater transmissibility, pathogenicity, and zoonotic transmission. The more potent mutants can be selected for the next passage.
As written in their proposal, CAS scientists are responsible for measuring “fitness,” which indicates the outcome of a viral infection—whether it develops faster or slower and whether it results in a severe or mild illness. Samples are collected before and after each round of passages to identify patterns of transmission and pathogenicity. This increases the likelihood of creating mutant H5N1 strains that can cause more severe diseases with faster transmission.
The second clue is linked to the animal models they carefully selected to reproduce the virus—mallard ducks, Chinese geese, and Japanese quail.
The mallard duck is the most abundant migratory and wide-ranging duck on Earth and can crossbreed with 63 other species. It is an asymptomatic carrier harboring many bird flu viruses, potentially allowing more mutated viruses to recombine.
Furthermore, the Japanese quail has a dual expression of two bird flu virus receptors on both avian and mammalian species. It is such an ideal host that after a series of passage trials, people can identify those strains that are more adaptive to mammalian receptors but not bird receptors.
Therefore, this study design favors the selection of a mutated H5N1 virus that has enhanced tropism for mammalian hosts with a higher pathogenicity or transmissibility.
This is a technologically well-designed study setting to achieve the gain-of-function purpose, in which the study objective appears to be about enhanced surveillance, monitoring, fitness, and vaccine studies.
In addition, this study plans to use live viruses to challenge mallard ducks with low-pathogenic bird flu viruses first, followed by a high-pathogenic virus.
Because the bird flu virus is highly prone to recombination, a genome reassortment among high- and low-pathogenic bird flu viruses could generate new recombinant influenza viruses with unpredictable host tropism or pathogenicity.
Therefore, this creates an even higher potential of generating new gain-of-function mutants.
“We are disturbed by recent reports about the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-linked Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on bird flu research,” they wrote in an April 12 letter.
“This research, funded by American taxpayers, could potentially generate dangerous new lab-created virus strains that threaten our national security and public health,” they added.
In this study, an inhaled aerosol dose of 5.1 log10 plaque-forming units (PFU) caused a strong fever and acute respiratory disease in four out of six macaques, resulting in their deaths. PFU is a method of measuring the amount of the virus.
In comparison, in studies conducted from 2001 to 2014 with cynomolgus macaques, when these monkeys were given high doses of H5N1 (6.5–7.8 log10 PFU) through various routes (nose, throat, mouth, and eyes), they usually developed mild illness, and only 2 out of 49 monkeys died from the infection, based on previous reports.
This research on the bird flu viruses and current outbreaks in birds and cows should also remind us of the fiercely debated origin of SARS-CoV-2.
It’s particularly important to consider the current focus of scientific research after experiencing an unprecedented, challenging period due to COVID-19. Some Chinese government-controlled labs are still creating more dangerous viruses and enabling them to spread on a large scale in the name of pandemic preparedness. This raises the question of whether they are truly helping people or creating more diseases.
These alarming facts and circumstances should prompt immediate, thorough investigations into Chinese labs and their potential connection to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak.
In the pursuit of advancing science and researching more effective ways to protect people, such as developing vaccines, the underlying driving force behind such endeavors is often technological competition. However, scientists may have created more problems than solutions for humanity.
Editing the virus to enhance its transmissibility and pathogenicity, and researching its pandemic potential, only fuels more fear, rather than resolving the issue.
Ironically, some modern technology can have an extensive negative impact on society. The ability of scientists to conduct GOF research does not justify its necessity.
Influenza A viruses are classified into dozens of subtypes according to two types of glycoproteins on the surface of the virus.
The “H5Nx” nomenclature indicates different neuraminidase types (such as N1, N2, N6, N8) are paired with the H5 protein.
Five subtypes of avian influenza A viruses, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 are known to have caused human infections.
Bird flu viruses are classified as either low or highly pathogenic avian influenza based on the disease severity they trigger.
The H5 and H7 subtypes are highly pathogenic. Specifically, A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses have caused most of the avian influenza A viral infections reported in people.

New Human Case of Bird Flu Confirmed by CDC,1717027200000,"The case is the third confirmed this year.

A new human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on May 30.
The patient is a Michigan resident who works with dairy cows. The patient’s age, gender, and work location weren’t disclosed by federal or state officials.
The patient likely contracted the bird flu from cattle, officials said. The person experienced symptoms after “direct exposure to an infected cow,” Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan’s chief medical executive, said in a statement.

The case is the third confirmed among humans in the United States this year. The previously confirmed cases, one each in Texas and Michigan, also cropped up in farm workers.
Both of those workers experienced inflamed eyes and have since recovered, as did a person who contracted the illness in Colorado in 2022.
Globally, more than half of cases reported to the World Health Organization since the early 2000s have resulted in death.
The new case is from a different farm than the earlier case in the state, according to Michigan authorities.
The new patient experienced symptoms including cough without fever and eye discomfort with watery discharge. The person was given an antiviral, is isolating at home, and is seeing the resolution of their symptoms, according to the CDC.
Antivirals used against influenza include oseltamivir, also known as Tamiflu.
The person wasn’t wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).
“This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms,” Dr. Bagdasarian said.
None of the patient’s contacts have developed symptoms, and none of the farm’s other workers have reported symptoms.
There’s no signs of person-to-person transmission of the influenza, also known as the bird flu or H5N1, CDC and Michigan officials said.
While the CDC maintains that the risk to the general public is low, it says farm workers are at greater risk and advises them to take a number of precautions, including wearing masks and gloves when dealing with animals with suspected or confirmed cases.
There are about 105,800 workers on U.S. dairy farms as of 2023, according to IBISWorld.
The bird flu jumped to cows in late 2023 or earlier this year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists.
Cases have since been confirmed in 67 herds across nine states, including Michigan, the department says.
The department in late April began requiring lactating cows to test negative before being shipped across state lines. It later said the order likely helped prevent the spread of the virus to new states.
The USDA reported 2,492 pre-movement tests as of Wednesday but said that number does not equal the number of animals tested.
A pilot program for bulk testing milk could begin in June for farmers who choose to participate, according to documents the USDA sent to industry officials this week.
Agriculture officials in six states said on May 29 they were reviewing the USDA’s proposal for the program. The USDA declined to comment.
“Once it has support and participation from farms, the USDA program could help reduce the threat of H5N1 in dairy herds, further mitigate risk among farm workers, and continue to protect our nation’s commercial milk supply,” the International Dairy Foods Association said in a statement.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimated that 20 percent of the U.S. milk supply shows signs of the virus, although further testing found no viable virus.
Farmers said testing milk from bulk storage tanks offers the chance to collect a sample from all the cows within a herd and would be more efficient than testing samples from individual animals.
Bulk tanks of milk from individual herds would need three consecutive weeks of negative testing results to show the herd is free of bird flu and enter the new program, according to USDA documents dated May 24.
Farmers would then need to submit milk samples from bulk tanks weekly to maintain their status, the documents say. Continued negative results would mean no additional testing is needed before shipping cattle between states, according to the documents.
Three weeks of testing milk from bulk tanks isn’t enough to confirm a herd is free of bird flu, though, said Gail Hansen, a veterinary and public health consultant. Samples from healthy cows could dilute samples from a small number of infected cattle in the same herd when their milk mixes in the tank, she said.

Third person infected in U.S. bird flu outbreak — but with new symptoms,1717027200000,"Another human case of bird flu linked to sick dairy cows has been detected in Michigan, marking the third farmworker diagnosed with the illness in the United States since March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. None of the cases are connected. This is the second farmworker in Michigan in a week to be diagnosed with the illness. And a dairy worker in Texas was diagnosed in March. In those cases, the patients' only sign of illness was pinkeye, or conjunctivitis. This latest case is different, however, because the patient also had upper respiratory symptoms, including sore throat, cough and congestion. During a media briefing Thursday, Dr. Nirav Shah, the CDC's principal deputy director, said there's no indication yet that the virus, an A strain of influenza called H5N1, is spreading from person to person, although the risk does increase with respiratory symptoms. ""Simply put, someone who's coughing may be more likely to transmit the virus than someone who has an eye infection like conjunctivitis,"" he said.  The CDC is performing genetic testing on samples of the virus taken from the patient to look for changes that would indicate whether it’s mutating in ways that would allow it to be more transmissible. Those results could be available within days. The latest patient also had eye discomfort and watery eyes, but it was unclear whether the person had been diagnosed with pinkeye. Like in the previous cases, the patient was given Tamiflu and was reportedly recovering.  Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said that neither of the sickened Michigan workers had been wearing full personal protective equipment, or PPE, when they became infected. “With the first case in Michigan, eye symptoms occurred after a direct splash of infected milk to the eye. With this case, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow,"" Bagdasarian wrote in a press announcement. ""PPE is an important tool in preventing spread."" All of the farmworkers at this latest Michigan dairy are being monitored for symptoms. The CDC recommended that anyone who comes into contact with a sick cow watch for symptoms for 10 days. As many as 67 herds in nine states have been affected, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. In addition to herds in Michigan, dairy cattle in Colorado, Kansas, Idaho, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas have also tested positive for bird flu. “Given the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, additional human cases in people with higher risk exposures would not be surprising,” the CDC said in a press release. Federal health officials said that the risk of bird flu to the general public remains low, and that their focus continues to be on the potential risks among dairy workers.  ""We should remain alert, not be alarmed,"" Shah said. The CDC said that its influenza surveillance systems have not picked up any unusual flu activity.  Preparing doses of bird flu vaccine The Department of Health and Human Services previously said that the government had started the ""fill and finish"" process of about 4.8 million doses of a bird flu vaccine. That process is likely to last until later this summer, said David Boucher, director of infectious diseases preparedness at HHS’ Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response At that point, the Food and Drug Administration would have to consider whether it is necessary to authorize such a vaccine. Boucher said it would premature to speculate on who might be first in line for the shots.  This is the fourth case of H5N1 overall in the U.S. An inmate in Colorado who had been working on a farm culling birds suspected to be infected with bird flu was diagnosed in 2022. His only symptom was fatigue.  Globally, less than 1,000 cases of H5N1 in humans have been identified. CDC data shows that more than half of those patients died, but that death rate may be an overestimate as mild cases may go undetected.  The CDC recommends that anyone in contact with dairy cattle — including bedding and animal feces — wear protective equipment, including safety glasses, waterproof aprons and boots that can be sanitized. The agency also said that people should not drink unpasteurized  raw milk.",NBCNews,yes,yes,"The article mentions that globally, more than half of the identified human cases of H5N1 have resulted in death, indicating a high mortality rate.

Here We Go Again: CDC Warns of More Bird Flu After Second Human Infection,1717027200000,"The following content is sponsored by The Wellness Company.
Earlier this month, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf issued a stark warning on capitol hill about Bird Flu, the Daily Mail reported:
“This virus, like all viruses, is mutating,”’ he told the policymakers. ‘We need to continue to prepare for the possibility that it might jump to humans.”
“[The] real worry is that it will jump to the human lungs where, when that has happened in other parts of the world… the mortality rate has been 25 percent.”
[…]
Dr Califf, who was speaking to the Agriculture Committee, added: “We gotta have testing, gotta have anti-virals and we need to have a vaccine ready to go.” [Emphasis added]
Right on cue, here comes the bird flu:

The infected farm worker, who has reportedly since recovered, is making waves in the media and among public health officials, who point to nationwide bird flu infections in mammal and bird populations as signs of an impending crisis.
Dr. Peter McCullough, celebrated cardiologist, COVID-19 expert, and Chief Scientific Officer at The Wellness Company, added Tamiflu to the acclaimed Wellness Company Contagion Emergency Kit. The Kit, also containing ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, Z-Pak, and budesonide, is built to prepare the public to the greatest extent possible for future pandemics.
Dr. McCullough said:
“Out of an abundance of caution, we are adding Tamiflu to the Contagion Kit. Tamiflu is a safe medication approved to treat Influenza type A, viruses like avian flu. We will continue to closely monitor this situation and make further recommendations as warranted.”
Oseltamivir (generic Tamiflu) is an antiviral medication that disrupts the replication of the Influenza A and B viruses, including the avian “bird flu” H5N1 variant to reduce the severity of flu symptoms.

Hope isn’t a strategy. Take steps today to prepare for the next crisis.
Now is not the time to panic, nor is it the time to be complacent – now is the time to be prepared.
Unlike 2020, we have the tools available to defend our health from whatever they throw at us next. And that’s where the Wellness Company comes in.

TikTok's Raw Milk Influencers Are Going to Give Us All Bird Flu,1717718400000,"If you go on TikTok or Instagram, you'll see legions of wellness influencers promoting the benefits of unpasteurized ""raw"" milk, which hasn't been heated to kill off illness-causing microorganisms. Raw milk is risky business at the best of times, and despite what some influencers claim, there are no nutritional benefits to drinking it, according to the CDC. But it's now also a vector for H5N1, the new bird flu spreading through cows. On April 1, it was confirmed that H5N1 had spread to at least one person who worked with cattle—as of April 30, 36 dairy herds have been confirmed to have had cases of bird flu, although that's a likely undercount based on limited testing. On April 25, the FDA announced its finding that one in five milk samples from grocery stores had trace amounts of H5N1. Colombia has restricted the import of beef from US states where the virus has been detected in cows, and the USDA is now testing ground beef for H5N1. The World Health Organization reported that between January 2003 and March 2024, 56 percent of bird flu cases detected in humans were fatal. Half the domestic cats on a Texas farm also recently died after drinking raw milk from cows infected with H5N1. Pasteurization eliminates this risk. ""Raw milk does not go through this process, so consuming [it] could unknowingly place you at risk of infection with H5N1,"" said Brian Labus, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas public health professor and epidemiologist. There are still other ways that H5N1 can spread besides drinking raw milk, such as to dairy workers (human-to-human transmission hasn't been detected in the US yet). But according to the Conversation, that's not a common vector. And if other animals drink unpasteurized cow's milk, they also risk contracting H5N1, just like any human would. Raw milk is a big hit with parents who want food that's ""natural""—like in the good old days, when viruses killed a lot more people. Raw milk influencers have a sizable following, including some whose content doesn't center solely on diet. Take model Liz Siebert, who has over a million followers on TikTok, and who made videos last year on how she gets her raw milk from a nearby Amish farm, claiming raw milk was helping get her health back on track and reduced her allergy symptoms (most of these clips have now been deleted, but the reaction videos debunking her claims have not). Raw milk is also a big hit among fitness influencers and ""crunchy"" moms—parents who want food that's ""natural,"" like in the good old days, when viruses killed a lot more people. ""People are seeing more influencers talk about raw milk over the last year or more,"" said Jessica Gall Myrick, a Pennsylvania State University health communications professor. Myrick says that trend ""follows the changes in state laws allowing more retail and on-farm sales."" As a result, more and more people are buying raw milk: Ambrook Research reports that sales ""jumped 27 percent, from $12 million in 2021 to $19.4 million"" in 2023. Dubious claims about raw milk predate social media (as does research debunking the supposed benefits), but it's given those claims a new life. A 2022 research paper estimates that around four and a half percent of Americans are consuming raw milk at least once annually. In videos on TikTok, some influencers do acknowledge that there are people who think their raw milk obsession is bizarre—but they still claim that they're drinking it because it improves their health. Which is ironic: besides bird flu, raw milk consumption has been linked to cases of the diseases salmonella and listeriosis. But you're not going to hear about that in a podcast clip on TikTok of Gwyneth Paltrow talking about unpasteurized milk. ""Seeing an attractive influencer claim to be healthier and happier thanks to drinking raw milk can inspire people and give them hope for a similar outcome,"" Gall Myrick said. ""We remember anecdotes better than statistics about risk, too."" But Gall Myrick does think that people with significant online platforms can also be helpful in dispelling health misinformation about raw milk in a clear and engaging way, pointing to a video of author John Green talking about its dangers as an example. It also doesn't help that social media feeds quickly become echo chambers by design. ""The more people see of this type of pro-raw-milk content in their social media feeds, algorithms will keep giving them more of it, and then they are less likely to see stories about people harmed by raw milk,"" Gall Myrick said. Many states still do not allow raw milk to be sold in stores, with some exceptions for farms, meaning that people inspired by raw milk influencers may have to go through more hurdles to buy it. ""You can't find raw milk in most grocery stores, and social media likes and shares are not going to change that,"" Labus said.

Former CDC Director Predicts Bird Flu Virus Will Cause Next Pandemic,1718496000000,"‘It’s not a question of if, it’s more a question of when we will have a bird flu pandemic,’ Dr. Robert Redfield said.

Dr. Robert Redfield, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has issued a grim prediction that the next major pandemic will be caused by the bird flu.
U.S. officials recently confirmed that the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus had been detected in a cow herd in Wyoming, the 12th state to report an infection.
The former CDC director said the bird flu, when it enters humans, has a “significant” mortality.
“Probably somewhere between 25 and 50 percent mortality, so it’s going to be quite complicated,” Dr. Redfield said.
Dr. Redfield said that as the bird flu has spread to more than two dozen mammals in the United States, the virus has been adapting and learning how to change its use of receptors, with the risk of making a jump to humans growing by the day.
“So it’s going through a lot of changes. And as it picks up some of these new receptors, it can get closer and closer to humans,” he said.
“Once the virus gains the ability to attach to the human receptor, and then go human to human, that’s when you’re going to have the pandemic. And as I said, I think it’s just a matter of time.”
While Dr. Redfield said it’s impossible to predict with accuracy when the bird flu might start going human to human, he said the recent development of dairy cattle contracting the virus is alarming because cows are often in close proximity to pigs, and pigs have tended to be the last stepping stone for viruses before the jump to humans.
Dr. Redfield added that the natural evolution of the virus to where it becomes highly infectious to humans is less of a concern to him than the possibility that it will increase its virulence under lab conditions—through gain-of-function research.
The “recipe” for making bird flu highly infectious to humans is already well established, Dr. Redfield said, recalling that gain-of-function research on the avian influenza virus was carried out in 2012, against his recommendations.
“H5N1 bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows, with one recent human case in a U.S. dairy worker,” the agency said.
“While the current public health risk is low, CDC is watching the situation carefully and working with states to monitor people with animal exposures. CDC is using its flu surveillance systems to monitor for H5N1 activity in people.”
Proponents of such research argue it can help scientists better learn how the virus behaves and spreads, and come up with counter-measures more effectively. Opponents say the potential benefits are outweighed by the risks that such research poses as it can makes viruses more lethal to humans.
“While many believe that gain-of function research is critical to get ahead of viruses by developing vaccines, in this case, I believe it had the exact opposite result, unleashing a new virus on the world without any means of stopping it and resulting in the deaths of millions of people,” Dr. Redfield said at the time, referring to COVID-19.
“Because of this, it is my opinion that we should call for a moratorium on all gain-of function research until we can have a broader debate and come to a consensus as a community about the value of gain-of-function research.”
Dr. Redfield has also said that taxpayers ended up unknowingly funding risky gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the China-based lab at the center of the lab-leak origin theory of the virus that causes COVID-19.",EpochTimes,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, citing a mortality rate between 25% and 50%.

Bird Flu a Reminder to Put up Safeguards Against ‘Threat of a Future Pandemic’: Professor,1718496000000,"‘It is not a matter of ’if‘ but ’when‘ the next pandemic occurs,’ the New Zealand COVID-19 Royal Commission inquiry chair said.

The bird flu situation is reminder the “threat of a future pandemic is real,” according to the chair of New Zealand’s COVID-19 Royal Commission.
“There hasn’t been a recorded case of H5N1 in Aotearoa (New Zealand), and we do have protocols and plans in place to monitor this disease,” the University of Melbourne epidemiologist said.
“This recent development is a timely reminder that the threat of a future pandemic is real. It is not a matter of ‘if’ but ‘when’ the next pandemic occurs.
“It’s vital, from an inquiry perspective, that we have the right systems in place to ensure that any future pandemic, whether it is caused by H5N1 or another virus, can be managed safely and successfully for everyone in Aotearoa New Zealand.”
Dr. Blakely noted H5N1 poses a real risk to native wildlife in New Zealand and has already killed hundreds of millions of birds worldwide.
There have been about 900 reported human cases of H5N1 bird flu and nearly 500 deaths since 2003.
Nearly all known cases have been transmitted straight from birds to humans.
“Fortunately, human-to-human spread of H5N1 is incredibly rare and to our knowledge only occurs with intense close contact (e.g. caring for a severely unwell patient),” Dr. Blakely said.
“Airborne human-to-human transmission in a manner similar to COVID-19 or seasonal influenza has not been documented. However, we have recently seen a rise in cases in other mammals, and we have also seen mammals, particularly cows, spreading it to each other.”
The professor said the COVID inquiry continues to hold engagements to ensure they have a complete picture of the COVID-19 response.
The goal is to make sure New Zealand is “as prepared as possible for a future pandemic,” Dr. Blakely said.
Meanwhile, Sanjaya Senanayake, lecturer at Australian National University’s medical school, claimed the next pandemic could be just around the corner and bird flu is a “likely candidate.”
Dr. Senanayake made these comments on May 23 after the first Australian case of human bird flu H5N1 was announced.
The agency noted in other countries where high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 is present, human infection has been rare and generally only found in people who have had a lot of contact with infected birds or other infected animals.
Meanwhile, University of Queensland influenza virologist Dr. Kirsty Short, discussing the Australian bird flu situation, said it is “very reassuring” that the strain identified is an H7 virus, rather than the problematic H5N1 strain that is circulating globally.
Meanwhile, Head of Biosecurity Program at the Kirby Institute Professor Raina MacIntyre said recently that avian flu viruses do not transmit easily in humans because they are adapted for birds, which have different receptors in their respiratory tract to ours.
However, she noted they can mutate to become adapted to the human respiratory tract.
“For now, we have an avian flu outbreak in farmed birds which is not the most feared strain, thankfully.

Trump’s CDC Director: Gain Of Function Research Will Cause Bird Flu Pandemic With 25-50% Mortality Rate,1718496000000,"Former President Donald Trump’s CDC Director warned during an interview over the weekend that he is becoming increasingly concerned about a deadly bird flu pandemic erupting that will likely have a high mortality rate.
Dr. Robert Redfield said during an interview with NewsNation that he believes it’s a matter of “when” and not “if” there will be a bird flu pandemic in humans.
“Unfortunately, bird flu, when it does enter humans, has a significant mortality, probably somewhere between 25%-50% mortality,” he said. “So it’s going to be quite complicated. Since 2019, we’ve had a progressive increase in bird flu in chickens and ducks and turkeys in our country. And since then, you’ve seen it now go into a number of mammals. It’s now in 27 mammals in the United States.”
Addressing why it’s important to note the the disease is spreading to other mammals, he said: “We know exactly what has to happen for bird flu to be infectious for humans and go human-to-human. Scientists in 2012 actually did experiments in the lab using gain of function research, which I’m not in favor of, but the scientists did it. And they figured the five amino acids that have to change in the key receptor in order for bird flu, to gain a propensity to bind to the human receptor, and then be able to go human-to-human, something that obviously happened with COVID, where COVID, obviously, learned how to use the H2 receptor in humans and of course, became a very infectious virus.”
He said that bird flu will be transmitted from person to person “through aerosols and droplets”. He said that he is worried that a pandemic will happen because the virus will become contagious because of lab experiments.
“Normally, the five amino acid changes is a huge, huge species barrier,” he said. “So who knows how long that will take but as it goes into more and more different mammals, it’s changing, its use of receptors, it’s changing, it’s learning to how to use different receptors for dolphins and seals. And it’s learning how to use receptors in bears and polar bears and foxes and raccoons and cats. So it’s going through a lot of changes and it’s, as it picks up some of these new receptors, it can get closer and closer to humans.”
He said that he was concerned about the virus spreading to cattle because cattle are often in close proximity to pigs and viruses jump easily from pigs to humans.
“I’m less concerned, though, that this will happen through spillover and evolution in animals,” he said. “I’m much more concerned that this will happen in the laboratory, through gain of functional research. I can create this virus, literally in weeks to months by using gain of function research. I know exactly what amino acids I have to change because in 2012, against my recommendation, the scientists that did these experiments actually published them. So the recipe for how to make bird flu highly infectious for humans is already out there. All you have to do is look at it.”

Former CDC Director: ‘Just a Matter of Time’ Until Bird Flu Pandemic with ‘Significant Mortality’ in Humans,1718496000000,"The former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said “it’s not a question of if, it’s more of a question of when” a bird flu pandemic will occur with “significant mortality” in humans.
Dr. Robert Redfield, a virologist who was appointed to lead the CDC in 2018 by former President Donald Trump, appeared on News Nation on Friday to discuss the growing concern he and other experts have about bird flu. 
Watch video:
The highly contagious virus, also known as the avian flu, has “probably somewhere between 25 and 50 percent mortality” in humans, Redfield said. 
“Unfortunately, bird flu when it does enter humans, has a significant mortality. Probably somewhere between 25-50 percent mortality so it’s going to get quite complicated,” he explained.
The virologist said there’s been a “progressive” increase of the influenza in birds such as chickens, ducks, and turkeys in the U.S. since 2017.
The largest American producer of fresh eggs, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., had to temporarily halt production at its Texas plant after detecting bird flu in chickens in April, Breitbart News reported. 
An estimated 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets at the Parmer County facility were destroyed after being infected, the company said in a statement. 
The bird flu has since jumped to mammals, with the virus being detected in dozens of cattle across the country and even some dairy farm workers, according to the CDC. 
The first human confirmed to have died from the virus was a 59-year-old Mexican man, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. 
Relatives of the man confirmed that he had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, but had multiple underlying medical conditions and was bedridden for weeks prior to contracting the virus in April. 
“I really do think it’s very likely that we will, at some time, it’s not a question of if, it’s more of a question of when we will have a bird flu pandemic,” Redfield told the News Nation host last week. “Once the virus gains the ability to attach to the human receptor and then go human to human, that’s when you’re going to have the pandemic. And as I said, I think it’s just a matter of time.”",Breitbart,yes,no,The article reports a high human mortality rate of 25-50% for bird flu but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.,"it’s not a question of if, it’s more of a question of when",former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0,6,2,8,4,3,3,7,8,1,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,11.8,13.92,0.059425,0.08675,0.034575,0.278875,0.03385,0.557675,0.271575,0.1848,0.015425,0.13555,0.052,0.086,0.0,0.306,0.0,0.5663333333,0.2343333333,0.2083333333,0.0,0.1483333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,significant mortality,former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),probably somewhere between 25 and 50 percent mortality,Dr. Robert Redfield,0.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,0.312,0.0,0.0,0.797,0.0,1.609,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.312,0.0,0.0,0.797,0.0,1.609,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"Unfortunately, bird flu when it does enter humans, has a significant mortality.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Moderna stock is lone omen of bird flu pandemic,1718582400000,"NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The recent rise of Moderna’s stock tells a grim tale. The $56 billion company which pioneered a Covid vaccine has seen its market value rise 40% since the discovery of bird flu in American cows in March. The benefit to Moderna of a new outbreak is probably far less. The H5N1 flu that’s common in various animals might mutate to spread between humans. Influenzas have a history of making such jumps. About half of the hundreds of people diagnosed since 2003 have died. This virulence can’t be assumed, however, as mild cases have been missed and the virus will change. Likewise, the odds of a strain spreading easily, and when, are impossible to predict. More certain is the value of Moderna’s mRNA technology, which uses a virus’ genetic code to instruct the body to make antibodies. The company and its German rival BioNTech developed effective Covid vaccines faster than traditional methods. MRNA vaccines may have another edge. Traditional inoculations use inactivated virus, grown in fertilized eggs. The U.S. government even keeps a secret hoard of hens to ensure millions of eggs are available. The problem is that avian flu might kill fertilized eggs, hampering production. The value to society could be vast. The International Monetary Fund estimated in 2022 that the economic damage from Covid would exceed $12.5 trillion. The tab for a more deadly bird flu could be higher, and a vaccine might slash trillions off this tab. That’s why governments are stockpiling vaccines. The U.S. agreed to buy 4.8 million doses from Australia’s CSL. If Uncle Sam buys a similar amount from Moderna, and pays a rich $100 a shot, that’s $500 million of revenue. These vaccines may be a poor match against a pandemic strain, so governments are reluctant to buy too many. A pandemic opportunity would be larger. Moderna and Pfizer sold about $130 billion of Covid vaccines during the pandemic. Assume similar total revenue, that Pfizer takes half, and Moderna’s net margin is 66%, the same as in 2021. The company’s profit would be $43 billion. But if the chance of an outbreak is 33%, the boost to Moderna’s bottom line falls to $14 billion - less than the increase in its market value since March. Other firms may grab a share of sales. Post pandemic, global flu shot sales would probably be similar as today, or $7 billion annually. Moderna has planned for years to sell influenza vaccines. So this opportunity presumably was already reflected in its valuation. It’s striking that other stocks are not pricing in the possibility of a pandemic.

Former CDC director predicts bird flu pandemic will hit U.S.,1718668800000,"Robert Redfield, ex-director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, predicts a bird flu pandemic is inevitable. During an interview Friday with NewsNation, he highlighted the rising apprehension regarding bird flu, which has been detected in numerous cattle across the U.S. and has led to the first human fatality in Mexico, according to the World Health Organization. “I really do think ... it’s not a question of if, it’s more of a question of when we will have a bird flu pandemic,” Mr. Redfield said. He further noted that bird flu carries a ""significant mortality rate"" in humans, higher than that of COVID-19. Mr. Redfield estimates the mortality rate for bird flu to be 25% to 50%, whereas COVID-19's death rate stands at 0.6%. In late May, the CDC reported the third human case of bird flu since March. The three cases, all involving farmworkers, were not linked. Symptoms included a cough without fever and conjunctivitis, or pink eye. Currently, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus. Mr. Redfield, who has conducted lab research on the subject, explained the conditions necessary for such transmission.

Few People Have Existing Immunity to H5N1 Bird Flu: CDC Study,1719014400000,"Study analyzed blood from hundreds of people.

Many Americans do not have existing immunity to the highly pathogenic avian influenza, a new study indicates.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collected blood from 489 people and tested their blood for antibodies against clade 2.3.4.4b A H5N1, a strain of the avian influenza that is currently circulating in the United States.
“This study found no pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to 2.3.4.4b. A(H5N1) and that fewer than 1% of people had low binding antibodies,” a CDC spokesperson told The Epoch Times in an email.
The data mean “that there is little to no pre-existing immunity to this virus and most of the population would be susceptible to infection from this virus if it were to start infecting people easily and spreading from person-to-person,” the CDC said.
The avian influenza, or bird flu, has been circulating in the country for years among poultry. Only one confirmed human infection was confirmed before 2024.
But the influenza jumped to cattle in late 2023 or early this year. Cases have been confirmed in 112 herds across 12 states, and cattle are believed to have transmitted the flu to at least three people out of about 45 tested, according to federal and state authorities.
There are no signs as of yet that the flu is spreading from person to person, the CDC and other experts say, although some say not enough testing is being done.
“To monitor the escalating threat to humans of the H5N1 avian flu virus, we need to up our game: There needs to be more testing of dairy workers,” Dr. Henry Miller, a former U.S. health official, said on the social media platform X. He said that wastewater surveillance should also be expanded.
The three confirmed human infections this year have all been among farmworkers.
In the CDC’s blood test study, none of the participants were farm workers, according to the agency spokesperson. Each gender was represented about equally. Most participants were aged 41 or older, although there were 115 between 21 and 40 and 36 aged 20 or younger.
Participants were paid for providing the blood.
The CDC conducted the study to determine whether the U.S. population has any existing immunity to the flu.
The finding of low immunity “is not unexpected because A(H5N1) viruses have not spread widely in people and are very different from current and recently circulating human seasonal influenza A viruses,” the CDC said.
The agency shared the results ahead of peer review. It plans to file a manuscript with a journal at some point in the future, and there is no timeline to conduct additional studies, the spokesperson said.
Drugs used to treat the seasonal flu have worked well against H5N1 viruses in other testing. The three farm workers were treated with the drugs and have since recovered.
Worldwide since 2003, of the close to 900 human infections reported, more than half have ended in death, according to the World Health Organization.
That high mortality rate could stem from a lack of existing immunity, Jeffrey Ravetch and Stlianos Bournazos, professors at the Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology, said in a recent commentary.
Current influenza vaccines do not protect against H5N1, according to U.S. officials.
Some companies are developing vaccines against the bird flu, including CSL Seqirus. The U.S. government has already ordered 4.8 million doses from the company.
Manufacturing is slated to be done by the end of the summer, Dr. Mark Lyons, a U.S. Department of Agriculture official, said on a recent call with reporters. “No plans at this time to manufacture or procure more doses,” he said.",EpochTimes,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that more than half of the close to 900 human infections have ended in death.

New York City Preparing for Possible Bird Flu Outbreak,1719273600000,"New York City officials are working to prepare for a potential outbreak of the bird flu virus, H5N1, which has been detected in the city's birds, according to The New York Times. The community science group The New York City Virus Hunters found evidence of avian flu in samples collected in 2022 and 2023, sparking fears that the virus could eventually spread to people in the city. Avian flu has also been detected in dairy cattle herds in a dozen states, prompting New York's agricultural department to implement mandatory testing for dairy cattle that appear at county fairs. The virus was first detected in human patients in Hong Kong in 1997, but researchers have never detected human-to-human transmission. In the past 20 years, less than 1,000 human cases have been identified, but the Times notes that more than half of those infected have died. ""There is still a huge amount of uncertainty about when it will jump to human-to-human transmission,"" Dr. Jay Varma, an epidemiologist who formerly worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the newspaper. Although some experts expressed concern about the lack of widely available testing kits for the virus, a spokesperson for the city Health Department told the Times that the public health laboratory run by the state ""has more than sufficient testing capacity for H5N1 — several hundred specimens per day — and substantial additional surge capacity if needed."" Dr. David Silvestri, an emergency room physician who also plans and coordinates the city's emergency and disaster response, said in an interview that ""a lot of the kinks"" involved in pandemic response ""have been worked out"" due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Bird-flu testing, vaccines and treatments: 5 things you need to know now; Health officials are ramping up their response to H5N1 —ut this is not COVID 2.0, experts say",1719532800000,"The race to contain the bird flu kicked into a higher gear this week, as federal and state officials announced new measures designed to ensure the multistate outbreak among dairy cattle doesn't become a flu pandemic.

Public-health officials in recent days have unveiled more detailed plans to ensure availability of effective vaccines and treatments, step up scrutiny of dairy products, and other measures. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, an office within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, earlier this week released a pandemic-flu strategy —utlining steps such as boosting testing speed and access and encouraging the development of vaccines that can quickly tackle new virus strains. The Food and Drug Administration, meanwhile, this week announced expanded efforts to test dairy products for H5N1, the bird-flu strain currently circulating in dairy cattle.

Those steps come as bird flu affects a growing number of dairy herds. The virus was confirmed this week in seven additional herds in three states —olorado, Idaho and Iowa —ringing the total to well over 100 herds in a dozen states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Three U.S. human bird-flu cases have been reported in recent months, all of them tied to dairy-cow exposure.

While H5N1 has been known to circulate among wild birds for decades, infectious-disease experts have raised alarms about its more recent spread among a growing number of mammal species —nd particularly dairy cows that have constant contact with humans. Every time an avian virus infects a mammal, it has the opportunity to evolve and become even better at infecting mammals, said Andrew Pekosz, a professor in the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Each time, ""the virus rolls the dice and may come up double sixes in terms of acquiring those mutations that would make it adapt to a new host"" and transmit more easily, Pekosz said.

Although the risk to the general public remains low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it's clear that public-health officials are more vigilant than ever. Here's what you need to know about the current state of H5N1 and testing, vaccines and treatments for the disease —nd the steps you can take to protect yourself.

1. This is not a COVID rerun

First, the good news: In some ways, we're better off than we were at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, infectious-disease experts say.

Unlike the onset of COVID-19, H5N1 is not new to us —ublic-health officials have been tracking and studying it for decades. The federal government already has some vaccines on hand that are well matched to the currently circulating strain, and available flu antivirals such as Tamiflu are thought to be effective against H5N1.

Now for the bad news: The U.S. is still not as prepared as it should be for a potential pandemic, some experts say, as the H5N1 response relies partly on the voluntary efforts of dairy farms to help monitor and contain the spread of the virus. More than 60% of farms continued to move animals off the farm after the onset of clinical signs of bird flu, according to a recent USDA report, raising concerns about disease transmission.

Globally, the death rate among people with H5N1 has also been far higher than for those with COVID. Of the nearly 900 human cases of H5N1 tracked worldwide between 2003 and May of this year, 52% were fatal, according to the World Health Organization.

But the H5N1 fatality rate may not be quite as frightening as it sounds, Pekosz said. It's easier to track the more severe cases —hose that result in hospitalizations and deaths —hile milder infections may be missed, leading to an underestimate of the number of cases, he said. Even so, Pekosz noted, ""I'm sure the virus has higher mortality rates than seasonal flu.""

2. Testing faces obstacles

The people who are currently most exposed to H5N1 —airy workers —an also be challenging to test and monitor, public-health experts say. More than 40% of dairy workers were uninsured as of 2015, according to a USDA study, and many are undocumented. On top of the lack of health coverage, language barriers and concerns about engaging with health officials may put some distance between these workers and health services, according to health-policy-research nonprofit KFF.

Broader availability of bird-flu tests may also be needed, some experts say. Currently, the only authorized test that can specifically identify H5N1 is a CDC test that is available at more than 100 labs nationwide, according to the FDA. Many other widely used flu tests can detect influenza A, a broad category that includes H5N1 as well as some seasonal flu. If one of those tests turns up a suspected bird-flu case, then the CDC's test is needed to determine whether it's H5N1.

While there's currently plenty of testing capacity, if the virus adapts and begins to transmit more easily, having additional tests available would be ""incredibly helpful,"" said Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious-disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

The FDA is working with test developers who may be interested in developing bird-flu tests, an agency official told MarketWatch, but so far the FDA has not received regulatory submissions for any additional manufacturers' tests that could identify H5N1.

Nearly 700 people have been monitored because of their exposure to infected cows, according to the CDC, and more than 50 people have been tested because they developed symptoms. Under a broader flu-testing protocol, however, more than 30,000 human samples have also been tested since early March, the CDC said, and none of those were found to be tied to H5N1.

""CDC believes that the current testing guidance and supplies are appropriate for the situation now,"" a CDC spokesperson told MarketWatch. There are currently nearly 1 million H5-specific CDC tests, the spokesperson said, and 1 million more will be available in the coming months.

On top of testing for new cases, more testing for bird-flu antibodies is also needed, Pekosz said. Many people who were exposed to the virus early on may have no current signs but likely have antibodies that could indicate prior infections. Such testing is moving forward in at least one state, Michigan, with help from the CDC, health officials said this week.

3. We have wastewater surveillance to help detect flu —ut it may not help much

The CDC now has data that show the levels of influenza A viruses in wastewater from regions across the country and can compare them to levels at the same sites during the 2023-2024 flu season. But the wastewater-monitoring methods don't distinguish among influenza A subtypes or between human and animal sources.

""It's still a relatively new tool, and we don't have a lot of baseline data to identify true signals from noise,"" Wroblewski said. Some of the signals seen so far, she said, turned out to be tied to the dumping of milk or cleaning out of trucks that were carrying dairy cattle.

While there's ""tremendous potential"" for this type of surveillance, Wroblewski said, ""we're still learning how to use it most effectively and most efficiently.""

4. Some experts say vaccination should start now —ut government officials aren't making any promises

The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is working with the FDA to label hundreds of thousands of existing doses of vaccine and filling another 4.8 million doses of the same vaccine, which is ""well matched to the circulating H5N1 strain,"" an ASPR spokesperson told MarketWatch. Those additional doses will be completed this summer, the spokesperson said.

If we have shots that are considered safe and effective, it makes sense to start putting them in arms, some experts say. ""Immunizing dairy-farm workers would be a great use of the existing stockpile right now,"" Pekosz said, adding that ""vaccination can be very targeted"" to protect the people most at risk. But communication would be key, he noted: ""We don't want these hollow victories —ike we'll give vaccines to all these dairy-farm workers, yet no one shows up to take it.""

No vaccine campaign is imminent, the ASPR spokesperson said, as the risk to people remains low. The CDC spokesperson said the agency is involved in ""early, ongoing discussions"" of H5N1 vaccination and where and when it might be appropriate, but the virus is still ""largely an agricultural issue affecting animal health."" If the risk assessment changes, the spokesperson said, that could prompt additional steps to provide vaccines either to specific groups or the public more broadly.

If the virus evolves and circulates among humans, however, the existing vaccines may not be such a good match. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority is working to add an mRNA platform for flu vaccines —hich could potentially be integrated into its national vaccine-stockpile program, the ASPR spokesperson said —nd accelerating its clinical-trial efforts. Moderna Inc.'s stock MRNA climbed late last month after a report that BARDA was nearing a deal to fund a late-stage trial of its experimental bird-flu vaccine. The ASPR spokesperson said Thursday that ""specifics of ongoing contract discussions cannot be released at this time.""

5. You can take steps to protect yourself

One clear and simple way to lower your risk: Don't drink raw milk. Pasteurization kills off harmful bacteria and viruses by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time.

Some experts would still like to see more testing to ensure the milk supply's safety. ""We know pasteurization works, but pasteurization is not sterilization and should not be our only defense,"" Pekosz said.

The FDA and USDA have determined that, based on the information available now, the commercial milk supply is safe not only because of the pasteurization process, but also because of the diversion or destruction of milk from sick cows, the FDA official said. About 99% of the commercial milk supply comes from farms that follow the Grade A pasteurized-milk ordinance, which includes controls to ensure the safety of dairy products, the official said.

People with exposure to infected birds, livestock or other animals should use protective equipment such as N95 respirators, gloves, goggles and coveralls, according to the CDC.

If you have exposure to wild birds, poultry, cattle or other animals linked with H5N1, stay alert for signs of any illness, whether it's flu-like symptoms like cough, fever and body aches, or conjunctivitis —he eye inflammation that was the main symptom in two of the three U.S. dairy workers infected this year. People who have such animal exposure and develop any symptoms should get flu testing, the CDC says.",MarketWatch,yes,yes,"The article reports a high human mortality rate of 52% for H5N1.

Can the world really prevent a bird flu pandemic?,1719792000000,"Since Covid-19 took the world by surprise, scientists and policymakers have been striving to make sure the mistakes that led to the US having one of the highest pandemic death rates in the world are not repeated.&nbsp;
Progress has been fitful. Negotiations over an international pandemic agreement that was supposed to have been ratified this spring stalled in May, and the world’s nations have given themselves another year to hammer out a deal.
Meanwhile, the threat of bird flu looms, a reminder that another pandemic will come sooner or later. Experts are urging health authorities around the world to do whatever they can to prevent the H5N1 virus from starting the next global health emergency.&nbsp;
But the truth is, humanity has a limited ability to prevent a pandemic. Stopping pandemics before anybody gets sick would require marshaling immense resources to tackle intractable problems — like climate change and ecological destruction —&nbsp;that create the conditions for disease spillover from animals to humans in the first place. Factory farming is one well-known yet hard to reform risk factor for pandemics, a risk playing out right now amid the H5N1 outbreaks at poultry and dairy farms across the US.
And being prepared for what to do once people get sick is inevitably a challenge, too. The unpredictable mutations necessary for a pathogen to start a pandemic restrict our readiness for a scenario in which it spills into the human population and sparks an outbreak.
Arturo Casadevall, who studies infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University, put it succinctly in a 2024 Journal of Clinical Investigation essay on what the past century of pandemics has taught us: “All pandemics surprise humanity.”
Call it the pandemic paradox: To ignite a worldwide pandemic, a virus would need to evolve to the point that it can easily transmit between humans. Any vaccines or treatments or tests we come up with now, before the emergency actually begins, may not work after that next leap of evolution.
That makes it especially important to understand what is in our control and prepare accordingly. Contingency plans can try to anticipate the problems we might encounter in a public health emergency, helping us war-game how we would disperse protective gear to the public and medical professionals and increase hospital capacity. We could draw up vaccine manufacturing plans and set up fast-track applications for federal approval. We could also do more to monitor emerging threats in real time to identify a public health crisis as early as possible.
The most realistic hope for our preparedness plans is to have an effective playbook once a pandemic starts. We can’t expect to stop an infectious disease crisis from arising in the first place, nor can we expect to have perfectly calibrated countermeasures that we can pull off the shelf at a moment’s notice. Nature necessarily starts with the upper hand.
The pandemic paradox
With the world now on high alert for H5N1, it can be easy to forget this simple fact: The reason we are not in a pandemic already is because the virus is still not very good at infecting humans and transmitting between them. The WHO reiterated this month that the public health risk from bird flu remains low.
But in that warning is an implied “for now.” After all, the reason for recent concern is that the avian flu has adapted to better spread among cattle and dozens of other mammal species such as domestic cats and wild minks.&nbsp;
Still, while cows are much more closely related to humans than birds, it would take another evolutionary leap for H5N1 to become easily transmissible between humans and set off a wider outbreak.&nbsp;
The worst-case scenario would be a virus evolving to be more transmissible while also carrying a high risk of death. H5N1, with its 50 percent fatality rate in the roughly 900 human cases reported over the last 20 years, has been sitting in this pandemic staging area for years. 
How could it make the jump? One concerning scenario would be if avian flu started spreading among pigs, a species that is genetically even closer to humans than cows and cats, and has long been considered a petri dish for dangerous pathogens to evolve to better infect humans.&nbsp;
“There’s more experience with rearrangement of viruses in pigs, and it could go on to infect humans,” Tina Tan, who studies infectious diseases at Northwestern University, said in a recent Infectious Diseases Society of America briefing.&nbsp;
Addressing this very real threat demands balance as we try to monitor H5N1 for signs of increased transmissibility without overreacting and neglecting more immediate health threats.&nbsp;
As STAT’s Helen Branswell recently explained, responding to questions about why we aren’t already manufacturing millions of vaccines, starting mass production of one of the H5N1 vaccine prototypes already developed would mean pausing the production of next year’s seasonal flu vaccine — since both would have to be made in the same factories — for what is now still a theoretical risk.&nbsp;
Likewise, manufacturing millions of diagnostic tests when we can’t be sure they’ll be accurate if the virus evolves could end up being a costly waste of time and resources.
“There are people out there now who are saying we should be making rapid tests so that all Americans have them when we need it. Let’s wait. This virus is going to change. It will need to change,” Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, told me. “We don’t yet know if doing that is actually the path to having the tests when we need them.”
There are still opportunities to put the lessons of Covid-19 to use in monitoring H5N1’s pandemic potential. Experts cite the rapid genomic sequencing of new H5N1 variants in mammals as one example of the pandemic’s investments paying off, after $1.7 billion was pumped into lab infrastructure over the past few years. That capacity helps scientists understand how the virus is mutating and provides a baseline for developing tests and vaccines. We have also expanded wastewater surveillance networks that could be deployed as an early warning system.&nbsp;
But the US public health response to bird flu so far has had its shortcomings, too: Monitoring the developing risks on factory farms remains the weakest link in our surveillance system. Experts generally agree there isn’t enough testing of farm animals and the human workers who come into close contact with them. Better testing would allow us to more speedily detect a sudden uptick in bird flu activity and put emergency measures into action as soon as the situation demands them. The federal government has attempted to entice farms to test with incentives (rather than mandates), but the industry has largely resisted taking such measures.
The pandemic paradox explains why we’ll always start the next emergency a little behind. But there’s a lot we can do to make sure we catch up as quickly as possible.

Health Rounds - The battle against bird flu,1720656000000,"Hello Health Rounds Readers! I'm covering for Nancy this week. Instead of the Study Rounds you usually see here, I emailed some questions to Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan. She emailed back her insights about the current bird flu outbreak in the United States and beyond. What is your assessment of the current situation with H5N1? Both in dairy cows in the U.S. and globally? It's very bad in both the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., the dairy cattle outbreak continues to spread and there is no current possibility for containment as long as we don’t know the full scale of the outbreak. Globally, it is not yet in cattle, but a panzootic (multi-species) outbreak has occurred since 2021 and continues to kill birds as well as spill over to other mammals and humans. There were two fatal cases this past week in southeast Asia. To minimize the risk of adaptation to humans, it is urgent that the cattle outbreak be controlled. What could animal and health agencies in the U.S. and globally be doing better, and what are they getting right? The U.S. agencies are responding as best as they can and it’s very good that they have taken measures like manufacturing almost five million doses of H5N1 vaccines (potentially for protecting dairy workers and vets at high risk), as well as implementing the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-raised Fish Program (ELAP) to compensate dairy farmers for their losses. However, they don’t have sufficient resources or power to test as broadly as needed and there is not enough support from our elected officials (funding from Congress or the White House). Also, the federal agencies are not making enough of an effort to share data rapidly or granularly. For example, new sequence data is released sometimes weeks after it is obtained and there is not enough metadata (data about where and when the sample was collected, etc.) accompanying it to allow external researchers to perform extensive analysis. I want to be clear that this is not the scientists’ fault, nor the fault of the many officials working at these agencies, but structural issues with how these agencies operate. They are not designed for rapid responses or transparency, and it shows. Finland will be vaccinating at-risk people like poultry farm workers this month; do you expect other nations to follow suit? Could the U.S.? I hope that the U.S. does follow suit. I think it’s critically important to protect dairy workers and others who are at high occupational risk. Does mRNA technology offer hope of increasing our capacity to create bird flu vaccines at scale? Yes, although we are capable of producing flu vaccines at scale using existing methods. The bigger issue is funding the manufacturing and finding facilities to manufacture these vaccines without harming production of seasonal flu vaccines. Are there any steps individuals can take to protect themselves? Should they be avoiding any food types - normal dairy milk or unpasteurized “raw milk”? YES. Pasteurized milk is safe, but people should absolutely NOT consume raw milk. How far off are we from bird flu becoming transmissible between humans, potentially sparking a pandemic? Is it possible it might never happen? How hard is it to predict? There is not yet evidence that the virus can transmit efficiently between ferrets (a surrogate for humans) via the respiratory route. But that could change, especially if more human infections can occur. I always count on viruses to adapt to their hosts if they get enough practice. We need to contain the cattle outbreak now before that happens. H5N1 historically has a fatality rate of around 50%, according to the World Health Organization. But the cases so far in the US cattle outbreak have been mild. Can you explain what might be going on there? We don’t know, but it’s possible this may be the route of infection or just differences between individuals. There have only been four cattle-associated cases, so it may just be that we haven’t seen a severe case... yet.",Reuters,yes,yes,"The article mentions a historical fatality rate of around 50% for H5N1 according to the World Health Organization.

Three Colorado Poultry Farm Workers Test Positive for Bird Flu in ‘Preliminary Results’,1720828800000,"Three Colorado farm workers have tested positive for bird flu in preliminary results, state health officials announced Friday.
The three individuals were all working at a commercial egg layer operation in northeast Colorado when they began experiencing “mild symptoms,” including pink eye and “common” indications of a respiratory infection, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) said in a press release on July 12.
The CDPHE said they “identified three presumptive positive cases of avian influenza” in the three workers, who were culling poultry at a farm that had been impacted by an avian flu outbreak amongst birds.
None of the individuals have been hospitalized, the department noted. 
Samples have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for “confirmatory testing.”
While health officials initially said that the bird flu outbreak was not harmful to humans, virologists are now sounding the alarm that it actually could be more dangerous to humans than previously believed.
Former CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield said, “It’s not a question of if, it’s more of a question of when” a bird flu pandemic will occur with “significant mortality” in humans in a recent interview with NewsNation:
The highly contagious virus, also known as the H5N1 virus, has “probably somewhere between 25 and 50 percent mortality” in humans, Redfield said. 
The largest U.S. producer of fresh eggs, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., had to temporarily halt production at its Texas plant after detecting bird flu in chickens in April, Breitbart News reported.
An estimated 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets at the Parmer County facility were destroyed after being infected, the company said in a statement. 
The virus then jumped to mammals, with the influenza being detected in dozens of cattle across the country before impacting some human dairy farm workers, according to the CDC. 
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 152 cattle herds across the nation have experienced outbreaks so far this year. 
The first human to have died from the avian virus was a 59-year-old Mexican man, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed. 
While the CDC recommended that people “avoid close, long, or unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals” like cows and poultry in a May press release announcing the infection of a Michigan dairy farm worker, the family of the man who died said he had no history of exposure to animals. 
The Biden administration announced last week that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will provide $176 million to Moderna to create an “mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccine,” with health officials citing “lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
While Moderna is already in the beginning stages of making a bird flu vaccine — which uses the same mRNA technology as the coronavirus vaccinations — HHS officials said the new funds will aid the company “in ensuring the establishment of additional pandemic influenza vaccine response capability.”",Breitbart,yes,no,"The article reports a human mortality rate of 'probably somewhere between 25 and 50 percent' for bird flu, but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.","It’s not a question of if, it’s more of a question of when a bird flu pandemic will occur with significant mortality in humans",Dr. Robert Redfield,0.0,6.0,2.0,8.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,8.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,5,2,7,4,3,3,6,7,2,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,12.6,14.83,0.0180166667,0.0629166667,0.02645,0.2127833333,0.1091833333,0.3659833333,0.2833166667,0.1087333333,0.0162833333,0.0949333333,0.0,0.20325,0.0,0.09375,0.19025,0.09375,0.3935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104,0.0,0.0,0.612,0.0,1.1326666667,0.0,0.4166666667,0.0,0.0,,probably somewhere between 25 and 50 percent mortality,Dr. Robert Redfield,,,0.0,6.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,,,,,,,,,,,,0.312,0.0,0.0,0.797,0.0,1.609,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Olivia Rondeau,482.0,breitbart_h5n1_scraped_data_clean.xlsx,False,,,,,h5n1,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2024/07/13/three-colorado-poultry-farm-workers-test-positive-bird-flu-preliminary-results/,,[],[],,,,,,breitbart,Right
What the 9 human cases of bird flu in the U.S. so far tell us about the disease,1721260800000,"Four poultry workers in Colorado who recently contracted bird flu bring the total of human cases in the U.S. to at least nine.  Though that number is small, disease researchers say commonalities between the cases — all but one of which were reported in the last four months — are enough to start assembling a picture of how the virus may affect people.  The U.S. cases have been relatively mild and limited to farm workers who had handled infected animals — a sign that the virus in its current state isn’t a major threat to humans.  Some patients have reported typical flu symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, sore throat or runny nose. Many have had conjunctivitis or pink eye. “One thing that we can conclude is that the current strain of the virus isn’t well adapted for human infection, and may not even be well adapted for infecting the lower respiratory tract,” said Matthew Binnicker, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at the Mayo Clinic. The cases stem from a global outbreak of H5N1, a particular strain of bird flu that took off in 2020 and has hit poultry and dairy farms in the U.S.  The country’s first human case was reported in April 2022, in a prison inmate who had culled birds at a farm in Colorado and whose only symptom was fatigue. Texas reported the second case in April, followed by two in Michigan and five in Colorado — the four most recent of which were confirmed over the weekend. The cases' mild nature stands in contrast to the flu’s effect on birds and some mammals — including seals, sea lions, foxes, skunks and cats — that have died from the virus. Since January 2022, more than 99 million wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard flocks in the U.S. have been affected, which means they either died of the virus or were culled to prevent further transmission. And roughly 160 dairy cow herds have been struck since the virus was first detected in cows in March.  This H5N1 strain is considered highly pathogenic, a term that, when used in the context of bird flu, means it has a high potential to kill chickens.  Hearing about such a virus “really scares people, but that term is really a USDA term for what happens in poultry,” said John Lednicky, a research professor of environmental and global health at the University of Florida. “Just because it’s highly pathogenic in birds doesn’t mean it’s highly pathogenic in mammals or humans.” Lednicky added that some strains of H5N1 are deadly in humans, while others are not. Of the more than 900 total cases of H5N1 strains in people reported globally since 1997, around half have been fatal. But in the last two years, the global mortality rate has been lower: around 27%. And even then, those numbers largely reflect just the people who were sick enough to seek treatment. Dr. Peter Palese, a microbiology professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said patients in that tally are those who’ve “been hospitalized and who, in retrospect, have been in contact with large amounts of virus.” Palese’s 2012 research, which examined blood samples from 12,500 people without a documented bird flu infection, found that 1% to 2% of them may have previously been infected with H5N1. Experts still worry, though, that the virus could someday mutate into a version that causes more severe disease or that spreads from person to person. (So far, all transmission has been from animals to humans.) “The concern is that as more animals are infected, and then more people are infected, the virus will change,” Binnicker said. Why is pink eye associated with bird flu? Of the nine U.S. bird flu patients, seven reported pink eye. That includes all four of the recent cases in Colorado, which were linked to an outbreak at a commercial farm in Weld County. The workers had been culling poultry.  The state reported earlier this month that another patient there, a dairy worker who had been exposed to infected cattle, also developed pink eye.  Texas’ one case involved conjunctivitis without other symptoms. That person worked with dairy cows and developed redness and discomfort in their right eye in March. According to a case study in the New England Journal of Medicine, the person reported wearing gloves but no eye protection on the job. Conjunctivitis isn’t the most common symptom of bird flu in humans, but it has been documented in some people infected with different strains, such as in a 2003 outbreak of H7N7 in the Netherlands.  Scientists said a few factors could explain the symptom’s recent prevalence. One is that farm workers aren’t consistently covering their eyes when dealing with sick animals. As a result, dairy workers could get raw milk — which has been shown to carry the virus — in their eyes. That’s likely what happened to a dairy worker in Michigan who developed mild conjunctivitis and was confirmed to have bird flu in May.  The virus may also enter people’s eyes through respiratory droplets or aerosols (tiny airborne droplets). Or, some workers could have touched their eyes after handling infected animals or contaminated raw milk. “The receptor on the cells that the virus needs to bind to is pretty prevalent in cells in the eye, and that could be one explanation as to why we’re seeing conjunctivitis in individuals infected with avian flu,” Binnicker said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends treating people with bird flu with antivirals. Some of the U.S. patients have received Tamiflu, a drug also used to treat seasonal influenza.  “The studies that have been done so far have shown that Tamiflu is effective at treating the currently circulating strain of avian influenza,” Binnicker said. “It usually needs to get administered within 48 hours of symptom onset to be most effective.” More spread, more testing, more cases The reason that all but one of the U.S. cases have been reported since April, scientists say, may come down to two factors. First, the virus is spreading at a rapid clip among birds and sporadically infecting other animals, such as domestic cats, thereby increasing the odds of human exposure. Second, health departments have started monitoring and testing people exposed to infected animals if they develop symptoms. The CDC estimates that at least 10,600 people have been monitored for bird flu and at least 375 have been tested since the outbreak in commercial poultry started in 2022. “There probably is a much higher amount of virus out there today compared to a year ago, but we’re also picking up more cases because we’re testing more,” Binnicker said. Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive for the state of Michigan, said local health departments there have been screening for even the faintest of symptoms. “I think that’s why we’re seeing the mild cases,” she said. “It’s because of this active symptom monitoring that we’re doing.” The Michigan worker who had conjunctivitis, for instance, didn’t even seek out a doctor before being tested for bird flu. Michigan’s other case was a farmworker working with infected cows, who reported a sore throat, cough and congestion to local health officials. Bagdasarian said the fact that Michigan has only seen two cases after testing roughly 60 people suggests humans need lots of exposure to get sick. The workers who tested positive also weren’t wearing full personal protective equipment and had been involved in tasks like milking cows or administering fluids to them, she said. “We’re not talking about folks who had transient contact with these animals, who walked past a barn or a pen,” Bagdasarian said. “We’re not talking about people who just touched a cow once.”",NBCNews,yes,yes,"The article mentions a historical global mortality rate of around 50% for H5N1 strains in humans, but notes that the rate has been lower, around 27%, in the last two years.

The bird flu doom loop,1721779200000,"For more than two years, the US poultry industry has been battling a highly virulent strain of avian influenza, or bird flu. The virus has driven up egg and turkey prices and crossed over from infecting just birds to numerous mammalian species, including sea lions, mice, cats, dairy cows, and, increasingly, humans. 
And it shows no signs of stopping — only reaching new milestones.
The first milestone reached this month concerns the birds themselves. Last week, a Weld County, Colorado, farm that housed 1.3 million egg-laying hens detected bird flu and, per federal policy, was forced to kill the whole flock in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Those 1.3 million dead birds tipped the total number of chickens and turkeys killed during this outbreak to over 100 million — double the total from the previous outbreak in 2014 and 2015.
The second milestone concerns us humans. Earlier in July, bird flu was detected on an even bigger farm — housing 1.78 million hens — in the same Colorado county as the first farm. A crew of some 150 workers were deployed to kill the hens. They were given goggles and masks for protection, but the 104-degree heat combined with strong industrial fans in the barns made it difficult for the gear to work effectively.
Six workers contracted the virus, which made it the single most infectious bird flu event for humans in US history, more than doubling the number of Americans who had contracted the virus since April 2022.&nbsp;

Around half of the nearly 900 people who’ve fallen ill to H5N1 globally since the early 2000s have died, though the variant circulating during this outbreak has proven quite mild in humans. Patients in Colorado and elsewhere have reported pink eye, fever, and coughing, and the Centers for Disease Control maintains that the risk to the American public remains low. I spoke with four bird flu experts who generally agree with that risk assessment, but with some important caveats, which brings us to the third milestone.&nbsp;
Some of those experts said that, based on genetic sequencing from one of the sickened farmworkers, the strain of the virus that infected all those hens and workers is related to a strain that’s been circulating in cows. That means the strain is more infectious for other mammals — like humans — than a normal poultry H5N1 virus.
“I don’t think it is a coincidence that several people were infected with this version of the virus, which has adapted to cows,” said Philip Meade, a microbiologist at Mount Sinai Health System.
This doesn’t mean a bird flu pandemic is on the horizon. For that to happen, the virus would have to evolve in such a way that it effectively transmits from human to human and causes more severe symptoms, which may never happen. But that’s the bedeviling nature of bird flu — it’s highly unpredictable. Tom Peacock, a virologist fellow at the Pirbright Institute, which researches livestock diseases, said the risk level remains low “until it suddenly isn’t,” in the event that the virus adapts to transmit between people. That it’s circulating among cows increases the possibility that it could occur.
Is bird flu here to stay?
That the virus has been spreading in the US for over two years also raises the question as to whether it’s endemic, meaning it circulates year-round.
Experts told me it’s highly likely that it’s already endemic in wild birds, the original reservoir for the virus, who spread it to poultry farms in the spring and fall during migration. In Europe, which has experienced a steep decline in bird flu outbreaks on poultry farms this year, wild birds seem to have gained some immunity from the virus, which could happen here too.
But the persistence of H5N1 in the US during the summer months suggests that a “decent proportion” of recent poultry outbreaks, according to Peacock, seem to be caused by the cattle strain, which he described as a major change.
“The concern here is that the virus can maintain a transmission cycle involving cattle — which don’t usually die or sometimes even develop noticeable symptoms from bird flu — creating a reservoir from which the virus could mutate unfavorably or cause human outbreaks,” said Brady Page, an infectious disease research fellow at the Scripps Research Institute.
In short, we could be entering some kind of bird flu doom loop, in which it has multiple reservoirs to infect farmed birds, and can more readily adapt to infect mammals.
That the threat level is on the rise is also a damning indictment of the US Department of Agriculture’s sclerotic response to the virus, which has drawn sharp criticism from the infectious disease research community.
Bird flu first began to infect dairy cows late last year, but it wasn’t detected until late March. The USDA then took several weeks to upload critical data about the virus. It also didn’t mandate routine testing of dairy cows, and farms with positive H5N1 tests weren’t required to report them — a move that hamstrung scientists’ efforts to track and prevent the spread. It took a month for the agency to at least require testing before cows crossed state lines, and there’s no proactive effort to test large numbers of farm workers. 
The response is in line with the USDA’s deferential relationship to industry and explains in part how we got here. The USDA has resisted calls to vaccinate poultry birds because it would disrupt trade agreements, and thus the industry’s bottom line. The USDA also helped build the modern factory farming system, which provides the perfect conditions for viruses to spread: hundreds to thousands of weak, genetically identical animals packed together in unsanitary barns.&nbsp;

“We should treat potential pandemic threats like this virus with the same seriousness that we apply to our national defense,” said Meade, the Mount Sinai researcher. 
If we don’t, we’ll have a harder time breaking out of the bird flu doom loop. Without a vigorous response to contain the virus — and sober reflections on the pandemic risk posed by America’s meat industry — we’re likely to see more and more farmed birds dying horrible deaths, more sickened cows, higher food prices, and an increased threat that we spark the next pandemic.&nbsp;

Just How Deadly Is Bird Flu to Humans?,1726012800000,"Just how deadly is the H5N1 avian flu? The virus, which is currently sweeping through U.S. dairy herds, rarely jumps to human beings, at least for now. But when it does, the consequences can be grave: The World Health Organization reports that 52 percent of people known to be infected with H5N1 have died from the disease. The figure has been widely cited in academic papers, public health communications, and media reports, where it can provoke apocalyptic visions. ""Bird flu pandemic could be '100 times worse' than COVID,"" claimed one New York Post headline. An article in The Guardian leads with the WHO's ""enormous concern"" about the spread of H5N1, which, according to one lead scientist quoted, has an ""'extraordinarily high"" human mortality rate. The actual picture, while still alarming, is more complicated. The WHO's H5N1 mortality figure, an average of wildly different death rates from past outbreaks, doesn't factor in mild cases that went undetected. Even less certain is how lethal H5N1 would be if it evolves to spread not just from animals to humans, but also from person to person. That genetic twist would likely diminish H5N1's virulence, experts predict, but no one can say how much less deadly it might become. And even a virus that kills far fewer than 52 percent of people would be devastating: As the world saw with the COVID-19 pandemic, even a death rate of 1 to 2 percent can be catastrophic. But answering how lethal an H5N1 pandemic might be is no easy feat. A dive into that question reveals the ongoing challenges — and, some experts say, failures — of tracking the virus. And it offers a glimpse at the difficulty of communicating the risks and unknowns about an emerging pathogen. Since the first human outbreak of H5N1 in Hong Kong in 1997, the disease has cropped up sporadically around the world, almost entirely infecting people who worked directly with poultry. Between Jan. 1, 2003 and July 19th, 2024, the World Health Organization recorded 896 cases of H5N1 and 463 deaths. Dividing the total deaths by the number of cases results in what epidemiologists call a case fatality rate, or CFR, of 52 percent. But CFRs are notoriously uncertain. ""The fundamental problem is that a case is not a tightly defined scientific concept,"" said Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch. ""These numbers are something we have to use because we don't have something better, but people in the business are aware that they are potentially deceptive."" When and where researchers look for cases can heavily bias CFRs. A virus that produces mild, undetected infections in 998 people, sends two people to the hospital, and then kills one of the hospitalized patients will have a CFR of 50 percent if public health authorities only manage to detect those two serious cases. But the true fatality rate would be one person in 1,000, or 0.1 percent. Accurate CFRs are critically important in an outbreak because marshaling a public health response depends on understanding the disease's severity. For example, when H1N1, also known as swine flu, emerged in Mexico in the spring of 2009, tens of thousands of mild cases went undetected, causing health authorities to overestimate the severity of the disease. In a study published later that year, Lipsitch and an international group of researchers from organizations including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the actual case count among Mexican residents that spring was about 100 times higher than officially reported. On the flip side, though, if researchers overlook fatal cases they will underestimate the lethality of a virus. For instance, research suggests that health authorities initially undercounted deaths in a 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong because they didn't follow patients long enough to record everyone who died of the disease. Like many experts, Peter Palese, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, thinks that the CFR of 52 percent for H5N1 calculated by the WHO likely overestimates the disease's severity. To meet the WHO's definition of an H5N1 case, the person must have had a fever and tested positive for the virus in a lab with the technical capacity to follow WHO protocols. Because many of the outbreaks have been in rural areas without sufficient testing capabilities, the case count is drawn almost exclusively from patients who were sick enough to be hospitalized. Meanwhile, said Palese, many milder infections likely went undetected, although the exact number of those silent infections is unknown. ""It is not completely clear whether these high fatality rates are real,"" said Palese. Outbreaks are like an iceberg where serious infections are immediately visible, but the larger numbers of mild infections are out of sight below the water line, said Malik Peiris, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong with extensive experience with H5N1. One of the best ways to get a more accurate case count, he said, is to test community members' blood for antibodies against H5N1, which would indicate a previous infection: ""That gives you a much more accurate picture of the bottom of the iceberg."" Researchers have conducted dozens of such studies. But results from that research, said Peiris, ""are a bit mixed and somewhat confusing."" While antibody studies of some H5N1 outbreaks find evidence of widespread mild infections, studies of other H5N1 outbreaks do not, even among people who worked closely with infected birds. Peiris described the disparity as ""rather puzzling."" It's possible, said Peiris, that antibody tests miss some cases. Type A influenza viruses such as H5N1 are characterized by the combination of two proteins on their surface: hemagglutinin, which can be one of 18 types numbered H1 to H18, and neuraminidase, numbered N1 to N11. Compared to the H1 and H3 proteins in the influenza A viruses responsible for seasonal flu, H5 proteins trigger a weaker response from the immune system, said Peiris: ""People may be getting mildly infected, but it's not enough to elicit an antibody response."" Peiris and other experts described the current H5N1 outbreak in dairy farms as a prime opportunity to investigate how and where H5N1 is spreading as well as how we might contain it. But in many areas, farmers who are worried about the threat to their livelihood won't allow officials on site to test workers or animals. As of September 3rd, H5N1 has been identified in 196 herds of dairy cattle in 14 states. But wastewater surveillance data showing spikes of Influenza A outside of flu season in some regions suggests that H5N1 could be circulating more widely, said epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, who heads the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. ""We've already missed a big chunk of potential worker infections,"" he said. Still, even now, antibody testing would give us a ""darn good picture"" of the number of human cases. ""That's the kind of thing we really need to get a handle on,"" Osterholm said. ""The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" Between March 2024 and now, H5N1 surveillance has entailed monitoring some 4,800 people who have been exposed to infected animals and testing 240 people, according to the CDC's Avian Influenza tracker. There have only been 15 reported cases of bird flu in humans in the U.S. since 2022, according to the CDC, with just nine of those confirmed as H5N1. Most cases have involved farmworkers who worked with infected animals, with the exception of a case identified in Missouri, which the CDC announced on September 6th. The agency is also providing technical assistance on an antibody testing by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services that is looking for asymptomatic infections among people who worked with sick cows. But, like many experts, Osterholm is worried that testing is wildly insufficient. More than 9 million cows produce milk across all 50 states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And the dairy farm industry employs more than 100,000 people. While Michigan appears to be ground zero for the current outbreak, Osterholm said, ""I don't believe for a second that's really true."" Michigan's agriculture and health departments have just been more proactive about surveillance and testing, he said: ""I'm convinced, quite honestly, that if they can get on more farms in more states, you'll see this is much more widespread."" Accurately assessing the lethality and spread of H5N1 is crucial to predicting what could happen next. For now, H5N1 has proven deadly, but still hard for humans to catch. ""If this were to become a pandemic virus,"" Osterholm said. it would have to go through major changes. What those changes would mean for the virus' lethality, though, is unclear. H5N1 could develop the capability for person-to-person transmission in a few ways. In the process of replicating, viruses could acquire random mutations that make them better suited to a human host. In addition, different types of viruses can swap genes through a process called reassortment. So, if a human or other animal were infected with both a typical human flu virus and H5N1, those viruses could generate a new strain that was both deadly and easily transmitted. Only a small set of avian influenza viruses have evolved to infect mammals, said Thomas Friedrich, a University of Wisconsin virologist who studies the evolution of pandemic viruses. To infect a host, viruses latch on to receptors on the surface of cells, Friedrich explained. The receptors H5N1 binds to in birds are configured differently from most of those in humans. People only have bird-type receptors deep in the lungs, said Friedrich, where infection is associated with severe disease. That can help explain both why human infections with H5N1 viruses have tended to be very severe, he said. And why those viruses that infect those unfortunate humans have a hard time getting from that human to another one. To efficiently spread from person to person, the virus would need the ability to attach to human-type receptors in the upper respiratory tract. Once it takes hold there, talking, sneezing, coughing, and even breathing will then spew it into the world. While it would probably only take a couple of genetic changes to get to that point, said Friedrich, we don't find a whole lot of evidence that bird viruses infecting humans are evolving toward the ability to bind those upper respiratory tract cells. One theory for why, so far, H5N1 has not evolved to infect the upper respiratory tract in people is that the virus so successfully survives and replicates in the lower lungs that it outcompetes any mutations, said Friedrich. Data from his lab and others suggest that mutations that could bind with human-type receptors die off before taking hold. But that could change, he said, when the virus infects a species with both human-style and bird-style receptors. For example, researchers have pinpointed the start of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to pigs, which can be infected with both human and bird flu. And a recent study in preprint that has not yet been peer-reviewed finds that cow udders can also contain both types of receptors and so could potentially become a mixing vessel for bird and flu viruses. A new study published in the journal Nature suggests that may already be happening. A team of researchers from the U.S. and Japan found that H5N1 virus isolated from the milk of infected cows could bind with both human and bird receptors. Those results are controversial, however, as other researchers who've studied current strains of the virus concluded that it hasn't become more specific to humans. In the last two years, H5N1 has spread to nonhuman mammals such as foxes, skunks, cats, mice, and marine mammals — perhaps both because they are encountering more infected birds and because the virus has become better suited to mammalian hosts, said Friedrich. If the virus further evolved to infect the upper respiratory tract, rather than the lower lungs, of humans, researchers speculate that could make it less lethal, he said: But there is no hard-and-fast rule that viruses don't evolve to kill their host. Like many researchers, Peiris is concerned that if H5N1 becomes a pandemic virus, the mortality rate would be much higher than that of Covid-19. He pointed to a recent CDC study showing that an H5N1 virus isolated from a person infected in a recent outbreak was lethal to ferrets, which he said are the best animal model for human severity and transmission. An H5N1 pandemic would have catastrophic consequences, he said. I have no doubt about that. There is one hopeful note. In early 2024, Peiris and his colleagues published a study suggesting that previous infection with the H1N1 swine flu may provide some protection against H5N1. In testing blood samples collected from a random sample of 63 adult blood donors, the researchers found that antibodies resulting from a previous infection of swine flu also reacted to the N1 protein in H5N1. While that immune response wouldn't block an infection entirely, it might mitigate its severity, said Peiris. The team is now studying that possibility in animal models. For now, many public health experts remain frustrated by the lack of clear data on H5N1 — especially following similar problems in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Public health authorities should be doing far more testing for evidence of H5N1 in agricultural workers, said Jennifer Nuzzo, who directs the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. But even if they did test more, said Nuzzo, there is a need for standardized protocols. This is one of those things that we know we need to do, said Nuzzo, who spoke with Undark in June. Since then, the CDC has published such protocols for antibody testing, which would make studies easier to compare because researchers have used different methods in previous outbreaks. That has been an issue in the past, when, Nuzzo said, we jumped to very consequential conclusions based on these data that could very well be the product of a very biased study design. While Nuzzo would like to see more farmworkers tested regularly, she acknowledges that it's a hard-to-reach population. Farm owners aren't always cooperative. And the workers, many of whom are undocumented, may also be reluctant to submit to testing that they view as a threat to their tenuous lives in the U.S. In the meantime, Nuzzo is adamant that farmworkers should be offered vaccination against the virus. Amid the uncertainty, some public health experts suggest, the public conversation about H5N1 has become disconcertingly contradictory, with reassuring messages that risks are low juxtaposed against warnings of a brewing pandemic. Communication about the threat of H5N1 often lacks nuance and perspective, said Osterholm. Figures like a 52 percent death rate, he said, do little to capture the profound unknowns about an ever-changing virus. At the same time, statements saying that there's little reason for the public to worry about H5N1 — like recent pronouncements from the CDC — appear to downplay the threat. For example, Nuzzo emphasized that the risk to farmworkers is not low. It's true that the virus currently poses little risk to the general public, said Osterholm. But all that could change tonight. Many health authorities view the flood of alarming and conflicting information on Covid-19 as an example of how not to communicate during a pandemic. Public guidance from the CDC was confusing and overwhelming, according to a 2022 internal review. A common mistake was oversimplifying information, stripping out essential details and glossing over unknowns, said Nuzzo. That undermined people's trust in advice that changed along with the evolving scientific information. You have to take people on the journey with you, she said.

CDC says a second health care worker tied to Missouri bird flu case had symptoms,1726790400000,"A second health worker in contact with the Missouri patient who tested positive for H5N1 also developed respiratory symptoms but wasn’t tested for influenza, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. The Missouri bird flu patient, who didn’t have known contact with poultry or dairy cows, was hospitalized in August and tested positive for the H5 virus. The person, who had severe underlying conditions, has since recovered. The CDC reported last week that a health care worker who cared for the patient developed mild respiratory symptoms and tested negative for influenza. Additionally, a person who lived with the Missouri patient also became sick on the same day. The household contact had gastrointestinal symptoms, an agency spokesperson said, which can sometimes be associated with an influenza infection. Initially, Dr. Nirav Shah, the CDC’s principal deputy director, had stated on a call with reporters last week that none of the patient’s close contacts showed signs or symptoms of illness, calling the situation a possible “one-off.” Since then, the three contacts have been identified, but it’s still not clear if they were sick with the H5 virus. The CDC has collected blood samples from the Missouri patient and household contact. It will do so-called serological testing that could confirm a previous H5N1 infection, although the tests could take several weeks. The CDC said Friday that the second health care worker wasn’t tested for influenza because the illness had resolved before the investigation began. The second health care worker will be offered a blood test to determine if there are antibodies for the bird flu virus. H5 viruses don’t typically spread person to person. However, they remain worrisome to health officials given their high mortality rate worldwide. It isn’t yet known how the Missouri patient got infected with bird flu, the CDC said Friday. Outside experts were alarmed by the unusual timing of the illnesses, particularly given that they occurred outside of flu season. Dr. Matthew Binnicker, director of the clinical virology laboratory at the Mayo Clinic, said it’s possible that the Missouri patient and the household contact were infected by the same source, or that one transmitted it to the other, indicating potential human-to-human spread. “I’m really hoping that they ultimately find out that there was some likely animal exposure, because the alternative is a little bit scary,” Binnicker said in an interview before Friday’s update. Although the Missouri patient had no known animal contact, CDC officials last week said they were investigating whether the person had any interactions with wild birds and bird feeders, or whether they consumed meat or dairy products, including raw milk. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said if the virus has transmitted from person to person, it doesn’t necessarily mean it has changed in a way that makes it more easily transmissible to humans. “Bird flu infections can be transmitted in a very limited fashion to people who have very close contact with the original patient,” Schaffner said. “That doesn’t mean that virus has picked up the genetic capacity to spread readily.” Since March, there have been 14 bird flu infections, mostly in poultry and dairy workers, amid an outbreak of H5N1 spreading rapidly in dairy cows across 213 dairy herds in 14 states, according to the CDC.",NBCNews,yes,no,"The article mentions that H5 viruses remain worrisome to health officials given their high mortality rate worldwide, but it does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this reported rate.","none of the patient’s close contacts showed signs or symptoms of illness, calling the situation a possible “one-off.”",Dr. Nirav Shah,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,1,3,1,6,4,2,5,5,5,2,Emotion and sentiment analysis completed successfully.,yes,no,12.8,14.23,0.0204126984,0.0864126984,0.0522222222,0.1725555556,0.1157936508,0.3311904762,0.3058571429,0.086,0.0093015873,0.0943492063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1563333333,0.1643333333,0.2323333333,0.1643333333,0.076,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.164,0.0,0.3045,-0.093,0.6485,-0.257,0.344,0.0,0.0,,"I’m really hoping that they ultimately find out that there was some likely animal exposure, because the alternative is a little bit scary.",Dr. Matthew Binnicker,Bird flu infections can be transmitted in a very limited fashion to people who have very close contact with the original patient.

Australia Prepares for Bird Flu Arrival With $100 Million in New Funding,1728864000000,"Australia is the only continent free of the H5N1 strain, which has caused significant problems globally, affecting wild birds, mammals, and livestock.

With the arrival of the H5N1 bird flu strain in Australia considered “unavoidable,” the federal government has announced $95 million (US$64 million) in funding to prepare and protect the country.
Currently, Australia is the only continent free of the H5N1 strain, which has caused significant problems globally, particularly affecting wild birds, some mammals, and livestock.
The funding is aimed at bolstering the country’s biosecurity efforts, with almost $36 million for protecting threatened species and boosting environmental measures.
Minister for Agriculture Julia Collins said the virus may enter Australia through migrating birds, which Australia cannot control at its borders and remains a serious concern.
Minister for Environment Tanya Plibersek highlighted the importance of early detection and surveillance, with the funding set to enhance Australia’s ability to monitor the virus’s spread.
In a joint press conference on Oct 14, the ministers announced in addition to environmental protections, $37 million will be invested in safeguarding Australian agriculture. This includes strengthening scientific capabilities and wild bird surveillance across the nation.
The government also plans to improve coordinated communication strategies to respond quickly to any outbreaks.
Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly addressed the human health implications, noting that although the risk of human infection is currently low, the government is prepared for the possibility.
He said the H5N1 virus is rapidly evolving, and that $22.1 million of the funding will go towards developing vaccines for human protection in the event of a future outbreak.
Health Minister Mark Butler echoed these concerns, stating that there is “no room for complacency” when it comes to the potential human impacts of H5N1.
The government is working through the interim Australian Centre for Disease Control to ensure the country is prepared.
The announcement builds on more than $1 billion in biosecurity funding allocated in the 2023 budget.
Senator Jenny McAllister, Minister for Emergency Management, said that recent crisis exercises had informed the new funding strategy, which also involves the National Emergency Management Agency working closely with states to ensure a coordinated response.
As wild birds migrate during the warmer months, the arrival of bird flu in Australia is expected, raising concerns for both wildlife and human health.
Although the risk to humans is currently low, the World Health Organisation has reported over 900 cases of human infections globally, with more than 50 percent of those cases proving fatal.
The government also urged the public to report any sightings of large numbers of dead birds, recommending they call 1800 675 888 or visit birdflu.gov.au. This will allow authorities to conduct appropriate testing to monitor and prevent the spread of bird flu in Australia.",EpochTimes,yes,no,"The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that over 50 percent of human cases have been fatal.

Avian flu spreading in California raises pandemic threat for humans,1729123200000,"SACRAMENTO, California — Health officials across the U.S. are working to prevent a potentially dangerous combination virus as avian flu rips through one of the nation's largest milk-producing regions during the height of flu season. Public health experts have long warned that avian flu poses a significant pandemic threat to humans, and the number of infections among dairy workers in California continues to grow. The timing of the outbreak will soon collide with the seasonal flu, complicating efforts to track bird flu and raising the risk that the two viruses could mix, potentially creating a virulent combo that could spread beyond dairy workers to the rest of the population. Despite what California officials say is a proactive approach, public health experts outside the state say too little is being done to track and respond to avian flu, which has spread to 105 dairy farms since the virus was first found here in August. The stakes are high: Approximately half of documented human H5N1 avian flu cases in the past two decades were deadly, according to the World Health Organization. “It will mutate to become increasingly optimal in humans as soon as it gains any foot in the door for human-to-human transmission,” said Michael Mina, chief science officer at digital health company eMed. “How far that goes and how fast it means the virus starts to transmit … is almost entirely unknown right now.” Other states have had a handful of avian flu cases in humans this year, including one in Texas and 10 in Colorado. But as the largest dairy-producing state in the country, with over 1.7 million cows, California’s response could serve as a test case for how to deal with large numbers of infected cows or people. Since the California Department of Public Health disclosed the state’s first presumptive infection on Oct. 3, 11 human infections have been confirmed, according to the state. All of the individuals — who work at nine different farms — have had direct contact with infected dairy cattle. “It’s important to note that to date, there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S.,” a CDPH spokesperson said in an email. But between March 31 and Oct. 14, only 25 individuals in the state have been tested for avian flu, according to CDPH. Workers who are symptomatic are first screened for flu before additional bird-flu-specific testing is performed. California is home to over 17,500 dairy workers, most of whom are in the Central Valley. The CDC set aside more than 100,000 doses of seasonal flu vaccine for the 12 states with outbreaks. Five thousand of those doses are meant for California’s dairy workers, and counties with many herds can now order them, but they weren't available until Oct. 14. Getting regular flu vaccines into dairy workers’ arms is meant to help detect avian flu better. With fewer people exhibiting regular flu symptoms, health workers should be better able to find avian flu cases. The effort is also intended to cut down on the chance that avian flu goes through a process known as reassortment that could result in a virus that can transmit human to human. “That alone, without contemplating high pathogenicity, equates to huge numbers of increased hospitalizations and deaths nationally and globally,” said Mina of eMed. It’s something the world has seen before. The swine flu pandemic of 2009 was a “quadruple-reassortant virus” made up of swine, avian and human flu genes. Over 60 million people got sick between April 2009-2010, and almost 12,500 people died. State officials say proactive preparation has enabled quick detection of human avian flu infections in farmworkers with exposure to infected dairy cows. Those efforts — concentrated in California’s Central Valley — are leveraging what public health officials learned from an avian flu tabletop simulation earlier this summer and Covid lessons learned even earlier than that. “Once we first heard about what's happening in Texas and dairy herds in other states, and knowing we're a large dairy state, we activated sort of an instant management team early,” California State Epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan said in an interview, referring to the first infections in dairy herds that officials traced back to the Texas panhandle. Anyone testing positive is being offered antivirals, and so are their close contacts, who are also told to monitor for symptoms for 10 days. If any develop symptoms, CDPH recommends they be tested for bird flu. So far, cases have all been mild, with most experiencing conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye. The state has repeatedly warned that it expects more cases to be detected in individuals who work with infected dairy cattle. “[The cases] represent the tip of an iceberg and a massive risk and game of chicken we are playing with this virus,” said Mina, who advocated for broad testing at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The only problem is that we are likely on the losing end. We still have done exceedingly little around surveillance testing and diagnostic testing so we don't know how frequently it is spreading to humans or among humans.” Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, also argued that too little information is being provided about human avian flu infections. “I've been very frustrated that we haven't had crucial details like the date of symptom onset and the date they were actually tested,” Nuzzo said. “These are outbreak standard data to report, but they're not being reported, and the absence of these data make it really hard to understand what's going on.” In California, the response has been divided into human and animal health, with agriculture departments taking the lead on testing milk to find infected herds, then flagging those farms to public health officials who look for infected people, according to interviews with four public health departments in the Central Valley. “California is doing bulk testing, so I think they're identifying a lot of herds through aggressive disease surveillance, and I think identifying infected herds is allowing them to better identify human cases,” said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who was a founding associate director of the CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics. In the meantime, until the extra doses of seasonal flu vaccines arrive, dairy-producing counties are pushing vaccines in their regularly scheduled seasonal flu outreach, setting up walk-up clinics at the Kern County swap meet or contracting with mobile health clinics in Tulare to visit farms. “Because of Covid-19 we had relationships established with our dairy industry partners, we did outreach of Covid vaccines with the local dairy cooperatives in Tulare County because we wanted to get farm workers vaccinated for Covid,” said Carrie Monteiro, a spokesperson for the Tulare County Health and Human Services Agency. “So we had those relationships established, which proved to be beneficial for us.” There’s no statistics yet on how well this outreach is working, as the counties don’t keep occupational data on who is getting shots. Overall, Californians are getting vaccinated against flu at the same rate as last year, said Brian Micek, a spokesperson with CDPH. Since the beginning of the outbreak in dairy cattle, some farmers have expressed reluctance to allow public health officials onto their farms to conduct testing and surveillance. USDA requires farmers to test lactating dairy cattle before crossing state lines, and offers financial support to farmers who lose milk production from sick animals. But tight margins in the dairy industry and limited federal support for impacted farms mean that farmers may be less inclined to test. USDA’s voluntary bulk milk testing program has enabled some states and farmers to comply with federal testing regulations and conduct additional surveillance, but just 64 herds have enrolled and just three in California. “The Department does not believe mandatory bulk milk testing is necessary at this time,” wrote USDA spokesperson Will Clement in a statement. “Since the beginning of this outbreak, USDA has been working closely with states, and if requested, working with states to help them implement testing programs.” The Food and Drug Administration plans to beef up milk testing later this month, deploying a separate study across participating states to discern how far the virus has spread. California’s bulk milk testing, required by the state “where there is elevated risk of the disease,” has contributed to the state’s high caseload and the state has plans to continue expanding its testing, according to Steve Lyle, a spokesperson for the California Department of Food and Agriculture. The state is currently testing more than 350 dairies with a combined total of more than 1 million cattle. “California is the largest dairy state in the nation, and we’re implementing a scale of testing that hasn’t been employed previously in any other state,” wrote Lyle in a statement. On the human health side, the state has tried to lean into preparation, relying on lessons learned and technology developed during Covid-19. The state has around 700,000 doses of antivirals in the state stockpile, and sent doses to 18 local health departments ahead of the outbreak. Some of those doses are going to the close contacts of infected workers to take prophylactically so they don’t get sick too. Local health departments are using CalCONNECT, an IT system developed for Covid-19, that consolidates information for local health departments from other systems, like disease surveillance and vaccine registries. Some counties are deploying wastewater surveillance, another Covid-era technology, to keep track of where the virus is showing up, although it’s complicated by the presence of infected wild birds. The state also reopened a mass procurement system so counties can quickly request more PPE to distribute to farms. A huge part of California’s response has been getting PPE to dairies ahead of outbreaks, especially gloves, goggles and face shields. Tulare County officials, for instance, say they distributed a million pieces of PPE to farms before their first positive case. Still, experts say more needs to be done for workers, like financial compensation for missed work. “We probably need to be thinking about ways of supporting our workforce, more than just recommending PPE,” said Dr. Meghan Davis, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a veterinarian. “There likely are other things that we need to be thinking about doing to help prevent their exposure.” With dairy workers traveling between counties and dairy owners operating in multiple jurisdictions, the Central Valley’s dairy producing counties have been trying for a uniform approach. In August, the six counties sent out a joint advisory to health care providers, telling them what to look for in their dairy worker patients, and reminding them to immediately report cases to local health departments. It’s meant to provide a kind of backstop, if patients or their employers aren’t reporting cases to the health department their doctors will. It’s important information to get out, because clinicians may not know what they’re dealing with and it could be putting farm workers at risk, said Amy Liebman, chief program officer for workers, environment and climate with the Migrant Clinicians Network. “The bottom line is we … think that the symptoms are mild, and as a result, we don't really have the documentation that we need,” she said, noting that workers may not seek care for mild illness. “We're not testing everybody, and we're not testing everybody when they have these symptoms, and so I don't think we really understand the extent of it at all.” Public health is treading lightly and trying to make it easy for dairy farms to participate and comply. As the state epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan noted, “There’s a lot of competing priorities as these farms are dealing with their sick cattle.” Officials are trying to use more social media to get the word out to workers, and texting to check in on people.

Bird Flu Update as Virus Suspected in Four Washington Farmers,1729555200000,"Four egg farm workers in Washington state have tested ""presumptively positive"" for bird flu.
This suspected outbreak in Franklin County marks the first time the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has been detected in humans in Washington. It is now the sixth U.S. state where humans have tested positive for this highly infectious strain of the virus.
Around 800,000 chickens at the same farm were euthanized after the Washington State Department of Agriculture found they had been infected by an outbreak of avian influenza on October 15.
Workers at the farm were subsequently tested, leading to four testing ""presumptively positive"" for the virus, the Washington State Department of Health said.
""Washington has monitored the spread of H5N1 closely since it was first detected in poultry in the state in 2022, and our state is prepared with the knowledge, relationships, and tools to minimize its impacts on our community,"" Washington Secretary of Health Umair Shah said in a Washington State Health Department statement.
Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, refers to influenza viruses that primarily infect birds but can sometimes spread to other animals, including humans. There are many subtypes, but the most well-known strain that affects humans is H5N1.
Bird flu viruses are divided into two categories: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). H5N1 is an HPAI that causes severe illness and a high mortality rate in birds.
""Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses have been responsible for most human illness from avian influenza viruses reported worldwide to date, including the most serious illnesses with high mortality,"" the CDC explains.
There has been a notable outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in wild birds around the world in recent months. Over 100 million domestic birds across 48 U.S. states and dairy cows across 14 states have also been affected.
""H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has caused ongoing multistate outbreaks in poultry, dairy cattle, and wildlife,"" the Washington State Department of Health said.
""Avian influenza is a disease caused by avian influenza Type A viruses that naturally occur in wild aquatic birds throughout the world. H5N1 viruses can also infect other species of birds, and occasionally mammals, and can cause significant mortality in poultry species, such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, or guinea fowl.""
Human cases of H5N1 are rare but can occur through close contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated by the virus. It does not easily spread from person to person.
""On rare occasions, avian influenza viruses infect people and make them sick. Most instances of people becoming infected with avian influenza have happened after prolonged, close contact with animals infected with avian influenza or environments contaminated with avian influenza,"" the Washington State Department of Health said.
Before the Washington farm workers, the CDC reported 27 cases of H5N1 bird flu in humans in the U.S. this year, 16 of which have been confirmed as H5N1.
Thirteen of these cases were reported in California, 10 in Colorado, two in Michigan, and one each in Missouri and Texas. One additional case was previously detected in a poultry worker in Colorado in 2022.
""CDC believes the current risk to the general public from bird flu viruses is low,"" the CDC said. ""The spread of bird flu viruses from one infected person to a close contact is very rare, and when it has happened, it has not led to continued spread among people.""
Bird flu symptoms in humans include typical flu-like symptoms, such as conjunctivitis, fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle aches, headaches and fatigue.
In some cases, infection may lead to more severe conditions such as pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death. H5N1 bird flu has previously been found to have a mortality rate of around 50 percent in humans.
The Franklin County farm workers were found to have only mild symptoms and have been treated with antiviral medication.
""Testing of additional individuals on the farm is currently pending and the number of cases under investigation may change,"" the Washington State Department of Health said.
""[Washington State Department of Health] and [Benton-Frankin Health District] have provided personal protective equipment to workers on the farm, are monitoring exposed workers for symptoms of avian influenza, and are providing testing, vaccines, and treatment for symptomatic workers.""

First US Case of Bird Flu Detected in Pigs: What We Know,1730246400000,"H5N1 bird flu was detected in a pig in Oregon, marking the first detection of the virus in swine in the country, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said Wednesday.
The detection was on a small farm rather than a commercial pig farm, which reduces the immediate concern but highlights potential risks if the virus starts transmitting in pigs.
There is no risk to the nation's pork supply from this case, the USDA said, and the overall risk to the public remains low. The Oregon farm has been quarantined, and pigs, poultry and other animals on the farm were culled to prevent the virus from spreading and enable further testing.
Since 2022, the bird flu virus has resulted in the culling of over 100 million poultry birds in the nation's worst-ever bird flu outbreak, and this year 36 people have tested positive for the virus.
Less than a month after reporting its first human case of bird flu, California confirmed that 16 people have been infected with the disease.
To date, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has ""confirmed infection of 16 farmworkers with H5N1 bird flu in California,"" the CDC said in an update on Tuesday.
""Genetic sequencing of nine of these cases confirms that all are H5N1 viruses from clade 2.3.4.4b and that all are closely related genetically to the virus causing infections in domestic dairy cattle,"" the update said.
All of the cases in California have arisen in dairy farmworkers, the CDC said, as is the case with the majority of infections across the country. Elsewhere, 15 cases—nine in Colorado and six in Washington—have been associated with poultry farms.
Federal health officials said last week that a Missouri resident infected with bird flu did not spread the virus to others, alleviating concerns about potential human-to-human transmission during the current nationwide outbreak.
The Missouri case had raised particular alarm because human-to-human transmission could have signaled the potential start of a new pandemic. The patient's infection was especially worrying because the person had no direct contact with infected animals, unlike previous cases involving farmworkers.
""There was real concern that we were actually getting person-to-person transmission,"" Jeremy Rossman, a senior lecturer in virology at the U.K.'s University of Kent, told Newsweek. ""However, thankfully that didn't end up being the case.""
Health officials closely monitored eight people connected to the Missouri case, including six health care workers who fell ill after patient contact and one household member.
Bird flu symptoms in humans include typical flu-like symptoms, such as conjunctivitis, fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle aches, headaches and fatigue.
In some cases, infection may lead to more severe conditions such as pneumonia, multi-organ failure and even death. H5N1 bird flu has previously been found to have a mortality rate of around 50 percent in humans.
Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, refers to influenza viruses that primarily infect birds but can sometimes spread to other animals, including humans. There are many subtypes, but the most well-known strain that affects humans is H5N1. Bird flu viruses are divided into two categories: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
H5N1 is an HPAI that causes severe illness and a high mortality rate in birds.

Earlier this month, federal health officials announced an allocation of $72 million to vaccine manufacturers to ensure that the existing bird flu vaccines are ready for use if needed.
While there are currently no recommendations for bird flu vaccination in the U.S., Health and Human Services Department (HHS) officials emphasized that this measure is taken out of ""an abundance of caution.""
The funding will enable pharmaceutical companies CSL Seqirus, Sanofi and GSK to ""fill and finish"" vaccines, which involves transferring vaccines from bulk storage into vials or syringes. The preparation is meant to ensure that the vaccines are ready for distribution if the situation necessitates it, according to the HHS.
Health officials previously prepared nearly 5 million doses of the bird flu vaccine and said the new funding will double the available ready-to-use stockpile.
Other pharmaceutical companies, such as Moderna and Pfizer, are actively working on developing an mRNA bird flu vaccine using the same technology that they employed in their COVID-19 vaccines.

Could a bird flu pandemic spread to humans? Here’s what you need to know,1676592000000,"As avian influenza sweeps the nation — infecting more than 58.3 million poultry and 6,192 wild birds in the U.S. as of Wednesday, per the CDC — infectious disease experts are watching closely. Dr. Christian Sandrock, division vice chief of internal medicine at UC Davis Health in Sacramento, California, specializes in infectious diseases and has researched avian influenza extensively.&nbsp; Although bird flu is contagious, Dr. Sandrock does not think it poses a grave danger to humans. MAINE WILDLIFE AUTHORITIES FIND 6 DEAD WILD DUCKS THAT TESTED POSITIVE FOR BIRD FLU ""It’s predominantly a disease of birds,"" he told Fox News Digital in a phone interview.&nbsp; ""It’s very common among wild waterfowl all around the world, and it can jump to domesticated birds, particularly turkeys and chickens. It can also infect pigs, swine and many other animals,"" he said.  That’s not to say humans can’t catch it.&nbsp; Dr. Sandrock confirmed that people can contract bird flu — and it’s possible for them to get sick or even die from it — but he said the virus would have to change in some way to become highly contagious among humans. The contagion risk increases when a strain of avian influenza mixes with another flu virus that is more ""human-friendly,"" a process called genetic reassortment, he said. The end result is a new virus that is stronger and easier to transmit. REMEMBER THE FEAR ABOUT FLU FLARE-UPS OVER THE HOLIDAYS? DIDN'T HAPPEN, SAYS CDC ""A single virus can go from a bird to a human — but the real threat is when you throw in one or two other viruses from pigs or humans, and that sets the stage,"" Dr. Sandrock said. ""The influenza virus is excellent at mutating and recombining."" Erica Susky, a certified infection control practitioner based in Canada, doesn’t rule out the chance of human transmission.&nbsp; ""The influenza virus is excellent at mutating and recombining,"" she said. ""If there are repeated contacts between species that can be infected by one type of influenza viral strain or another, there is an increased chance of a novel strain that can adapt to transmission in a different species, such as humans.""  Although it’s still rare for humans to catch bird flu, the fatality rate is high if it does happen.&nbsp; In a virtual press conference earlier this month, Dr. Sylvie Briand, director of the pandemic and epidemic diseases department at the World Health Organization (WHO), said that when humans are infected, they are more likely to have severe disease.&nbsp; Although it’s still rare for humans to catch bird flu, the fatality rate is high if it does happen. ""It’s between a 30-50% case fatality ratio, but again, those viruses are not very transmissible,"" Dr. Briand said. To date, the CDC has identified five strains of bird flu that have infected humans: H5N1, H6N1, H7N9, H9N2 and H10N3. The strain that's currently taking the biggest toll on the bird population is H5N1. As of publication time, there has only been one human case of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. APP FOR BIRD LOVERS GETS PEOPLE OUT INTO NATURE WHILE HELPING BIRD, WILDLIFE CONSERVATION ""Over the past few weeks, there have been several reports of mammals — including minks, otters, foxes and sea lions — having been infected with H5N1 avian influenza,"" said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus during the February press conference. ""H5N1 has spread widely in wild birds and poultry for 25 years, but the recent spillover to mammals needs to be monitored closely.""  Lisa Steele, a farm owner in Maine who tends her own flock of backyard chickens, has been keeping a close eye on the bird flu outbreak. ""The avian flu is nothing new — it circulates every few years — but generally, it’s only during the wild bird migration season,"" she told Fox News Digital in an email.&nbsp; ""Last year, the cases continued pretty much all year. It is a bit concerning that the warm weather doesn't seem to result in a reduced number of cases."" People who come across a sick or dead bird should avoid touching it — and contact local authorities.  The bird flu outbreak has slashed egg production, causing prices to soar to record highs in 2022. EGG SUBSTITUTES FOR BAKING, COOKING AND EATING AS PRICES SURGE The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that by the end of December 2022, more than 43 million egg-laying hens had died as a result of H5N1. Steps to minimize the spread Susky said the highest risk of transmission is from direct contact with infected birds during the process of slaughtering and preparing them. ""The best way to minimize risk is to avoid contact with birds and wild animals,"" she told Fox News Digital in an email.&nbsp; The H5N1 strain of avian flu has spread to minks, otters, foxes and sea lions, among other mammals. ""Those working with birds or other animals, such as in agriculture, should be trained in using protective equipment to minimize potential exposure to injury from animals, fluids and aerosols — for example, from soiled bedding and feeds,"" Susky said.&nbsp; ""This could include handwashing, proper disinfectants, gloves, aprons, eye protection, boot covers, masks and proper facilities to provide maximum air exchanges."" Because the disease spreads through wild birds and waterfowl, Steele said it's important to keep bird feeders away from chicken coops or poultry houses, or take them down altogether if there are active cases in the area.  ""Backyard chicken keepers should take further precautions, such as keeping their chickens indoors or undercover to protect them from bird droppings, which also can spread the virus,"" she said.

11-year-old Cambodian girl dies from bird flu in country's first known human infection since 2014,1677110400000,"An 11-year-old girl in Cambodia has died from bird flu in the country's first known human H5N1 infection since 2014, health officials said. Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads in poultry and wasn’t deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak among visitors to live poultry markets in Hong Kong. Most human cases worldwide have involved direct contact with infected poultry, but concerns have arisen recently about infections in a variety of mammals and the possibility the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people. The girl from the rural southeastern province of Prey Veng became ill Feb. 16 and was sent to be treated at hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh. She was diagnosed Wednesday after suffering a fever up to 102 Fahrenheit with coughing and throat pain and died shortly afterward, the Health Ministry said in a statement Wednesday night. Health officials have taken samples from a dead wild bird at a conservation area near the girl's home, the ministry said in another statement Thursday. It said teams in the area would also warn residents about touching dead and sick birds. COULD A BIRD FLU PANDEMIC SPREAD TO HUMANS? HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Cambodian Health Minister Mam Bunheng warned that bird flu poses an especially high risk to children who may be feeding or collecting eggs from domesticated poultry, playing with the birds or cleaning their cages. Symptoms of H5N1 infection are similar to that of other flus, including cough, aches and fever, and in serious cases, patients can develop life-threatening pneumonia.  Cambodia had 56 human cases of H5N1 from 2003 through 2014 and 37 of them were fatal, according to the World Health Organization. Globally, about 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the WHO in 21 countries. But the pace has slowed, and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years. BIRD FLU KILLS SEA LIONS AND THOUSANDS OF PELICANS IN PERU'S PROTECTED AREAS WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier this month expressed concern about avian influenza infections in mammals including minks, otters, foxes and sea lions. ""H5N1 has spread widely in wild birds and poultry for 25 years, but the recent spillover to mammals needs to be monitored closely,"" he warned. In January, a 9-year-old girl in Ecuador became the first reported case of human infection in Latin America and the Caribbean. She was treated with antiviral medicine. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Tedros said earlier this month that the WHO still assesses the risk from bird flu to humans as low.

"Father of girl who died from bird flu also contracts the virus, health officials say risk of spreading is low",1677196800000,"The father of an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia who died this week after contracting bird flu has tested positive for the virus but has not displayed any major symptoms, health authorities said Friday. The death came amid heightened concerns over a wave of bird flu that has spread through much of the world since late 2021, posing a potential public health risk. The girl, from a village in the southeastern province of Prey Veng, died Wednesday at a hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh, shortly after tests confirmed she had Type A H5N1 bird flu, according to Cambodia’s Health Ministry. She had fallen ill on Feb. 16, and when her condition declined she was sent to the hospital with a fever as high as 102 degrees Fahrenheit with coughing and throat pain. Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads between sick poultry but can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. The recent detection of infections in a variety of mammals, including at a large mink farm in Spain, has raised concern among experts that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic. 11-YEAR-OLD CAMBODIAN GIRL DIES FROM BIRD FLU IN COUNTRY'S FIRST KNOWN HUMAN INFECTION SINCE 2014 Health Ministry spokesperson Ly Sovann told The Associated Press that the Cambodian father’s case is under investigation, and it was not yet known how he was infected. He has been put in isolation at a local district hospital for monitoring and treatment. A ministry team collected samples from 12 people from the dead girl's village known to have had direct contact with her, and laboratory tests confirmed Friday that only her father was infected. Health professionals have expressed concern about a wave of bird flu that has spread worldwide in the past year and a half, but consider the current risk to humans to be low.  ""There is always a risk of human infection, particularly in people in close contact with poultry or wild birds, and this risk increases during times where circulation of avian influenza is particularly high, as it is now,"" Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at England’s University of Nottingham, said in an emailed statement. BIRD FLU KILLS SEA LIONS AND THOUSANDS OF PELICANS IN PERU'S PROTECTED AREAS ""Thankfully, human infections are still rare, and the likelihood of onward human to human transmission very low. But this virus keeps cropping up in various mammals and this could potentially increase the possibility of further human infections. The risk to humans is still very low, but it’s important that we continue to monitor circulation of flu in both bird and mammal populations and do everything we can to reduce the number of infections seen,"" Ball added. According to the World Health Organization, there were 56 bird flu cases in humans in Cambodia from 2003 until 2014, and 37 of them were fatal. Globally, about 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the WHO in 21 countries, for an overall case fatality rate of 53%. But the pace has slowed, and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years. In the vast majority of cases, the infected people got it directly from infected birds.

Avian influenza: Symptoms of the disease and how it affects birds and humans,1691539200000,"Avian influenza is a disease that is more commonly seen in birds but can also spread to humans.&nbsp; It can be fatal to humans. It has wreaked havoc on bird populations around the globe.&nbsp; HOW TO PREVENT AND TREAT ILLNESSES THAT ARE MOST COMMON DURING SUMMER MONTHS Here is information about avian influenza, including symptoms, how it is detected in humans and methods for prevention.&nbsp;   1. What is avian influenza? Avian influenza, or bird flu, is more commonly seen in wild birds, but it can also spread to domestic poultry and to humans.&nbsp; The risk of a human catching avian influenza is low.&nbsp; It can be passed from bird to human, or from human to human. It spreads through infected birds' saliva, mucus and feces.&nbsp; Avian influenza is rare in humans and much more common in birds.&nbsp; 2. Is avian influenza a serious threat?  Avian influenza can be a serious threat to humans who contract it. The symptoms can be mild or severe.&nbsp; It can be fatal to humans when it leads to pneumonia.&nbsp; Those who work with animals closely are at higher risk of catching the disease, although the overall risk is still low.&nbsp; Since 2003, there have been just over 850 human cases on a global scale and 457 of those cases were fatal, giving the disease a 53% fatality rate in humans, according to The National Emerging Special Pathogens Training and Education Center (NETEC). &nbsp;  While the fatality rate for humans is high, there is a near 100% fatality rate for birds with the disease.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER It can also spread very quickly among animals because they often don't show many symptoms of the disease.&nbsp; 3. What are the symptoms of avian influenza?  Humans who catch avian influenza typically experience no symptoms to mild symptoms.&nbsp; Those with severe cases will experience common flu-like symptoms such as cough, headache, shortness of breath, sore throat, fever, chills, fatigue and runny nose.&nbsp; Avian influenza is diagnosed through laboratory testing.&nbsp; 4. How do you prevent avian influenza? You can protect yourself and other animals in your care or that you work with on a day-to-day basis by following safety practices.  Use protective gear such as gloves and eye protection when handling possibly infected birds.&nbsp; Also, keep your hands away from your nose, mouth and eyes after coming in direct or indirect contact with birds.

The ministry had announced on Sunday that a 50-year-old man in neighboring Svay Rieng province also had died from bird flu. In February, an 11-year-old girl became the country’s first bird flu fatality since 2014. Her father was also found to be infected but survived. 11-YEAR-OLD CAMBODIAN GIRL DIES FROM BIRD FLU IN COUNTRY'S FIRST KNOWN HUMAN INFECTION SINCE 2014 According to a global tally by the U.N.‘s World Health Organization, from January 2003 to July 2023, there have 878 cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza reported from 23 countries, 458 of them fatal. Cambodia had recorded 58 cases since 2003 of humans infected with bird flu. ""Since 2003, this virus has spread in bird populations from Asia to Europe and Africa, and to the Americas in 2021, and has become endemic in poultry populations in many countries,"" the WHO says on its website. ""Outbreaks have resulted in millions of poultry infections, several hundred human cases and many human deaths. Human cases have been reported mostly from countries in Asia, but also from countries in Africa, the Americas and Europe.""  The United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month that bird flu outbreaks were on the rise globally, with more than 21,000 outbreaks across the world between 2013 and 2022. Bird flu only rarely infects humans. Scientists worry that rising cases of H5N1, particularly in animals that have frequent contact with humans, might lead to a mutated version of the disease that could spread easily between people, triggering another pandemic. COULD A BIRD FLU PANDEMIC SPREAD TO HUMANS? HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Chhuon Srey Mao, the 22-year-old mother of the dead girl, told The Associated Press by phone from Chhmar Lort village that her daughter fell sick on Oct. 1 with symptoms of coughing, high temperature and vomiting. The girl received treatment from a local physician for five days, but was sent on Oct. 5 to the capital Phnom Penh for advanced care when her condition worsened. She died at the children’s hospital. The mother said that from late September, several chickens in her village, including at least four of her own, had died.

"InnovationRx: Avian Flu Hits Thanksgiving, Boosting Boosters, And Antibiotic Resistance Rises In U.K.",1669161600000,"InnovationRx is your weekly digest of healthcare news. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here.

For those who enjoy turkey to celebrate Thanksgiving, you might have had some sticker shock this year–t supermarkets, the average price per pound has risen 12% compared with last year. And a big reason for that is a massive outbreak of avian flu that has hit the United States this year and which, unlike years’ast, did not slow down at the end of summer. About 8 million turkeys were killed either by avian flu or culled to prevent its spread. To give a sense of scale, about 46 million turkeys are expected to be cooked for Thanksgiving, so that flu number represents nearly 20% of that amount.

Humans don’ get spared from avian flu, either. Although it’ very rare, poultry workers can get infected from the birds they handle, and that’ happened in the United States this year already. In some outbreaks, the damage can be high: in the very first recorded human cases of avian flu in 1997, 18 people were infected and 6 of them passed away. The mortality rate for other avian flu outbreaks has also been high. Typically, human cases don’ happen and more importantly, rarely spread from person to person. But because influenza viruses can mutate quickly, there’ always a concern that an avian flu capable of transmission from person to person could evolve. And if avian flu infections among birds remain persistently high, as they are right now, the chances of that only increase.

Coronavirus Updates

It’ been found that some of the omicron variants that are currently spreading around like BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6 and BJ.1 are resistant to most monoclonal antibody treatments. These are medications that act like your own antibodies and prevent symptoms from worsening. However, the BQ.1.1 subvariant –hich is currently one of the most dominant trains in the U.S. –ppears to be resistant to all monoclonal antibody treatments. BQ.1.1 made up around 24% of all Covid cases reported in the last week in the U.S. and the other dominant variant, BQ.1, accounts for about 25% of cases, according to the CDC. With these variants making up nearly half of all cases, the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody treatments seems dim. This is of particular concern for people who are immunocompromised, for whom antibodies are one of the primary treatments for Covid.

Why Business Leaders Should Promote New Covid Booster Shots For Omicron Variant

Business executives need to take the lead on promoting the newly-updated, Omicron-specific booster shots, argues Forbes contributor Gleb Tsipursky. Doing so will help reduce the number of work sick days, minimize COVID outbreaks, reduce employee fears about returning to the office, and facilitate stakeholder capitalism.

Avian H5N1 (Bird) Flu: Why Experts Are Worried—nd What You Should Know,1675814400000,"Topline

The bird flu outbreak is the deadliest one in almost 10 years—hich has helped cause egg prices to steeply rise—nd while infection in humans is rare, some experts are gravely concerned it could eventually make the leap and spread among humans.

Key Facts

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bird flu is caused by infection of avian influenza A viruses and typically affects aquatic birds (like ducks, pelicans and swans), but can also affect domestic poultry (like chicken and turkey) and other animals, including humans.

As of February 1, the CDC reports the current outbreak has led to one case of human infection (which happened in April 2022), 6,111 wild birds with the disease and over 58 million poultry birds affected—nd cases in birds have been reported in every state.

There is no evidence the one human infection spread to anyone else, but when humans have been infected by animals, the virus is deadly, as 56% of the reported cases in humans ended in fatality, according to the World Health Organization.

The virus is passed via contact with nasal secretions, feces and saliva of infected animals and through contact with surfaces infected birds have touched.

Although wild birds have long been infecting poultry, the disease’ spread to migratory birds has raised concern that it could mutate into a new variant and pass among people, since migratory birds are able to spread it more widely and to more animals.

In October 2022, the disease began spreading among minks at a mink farm in Spain, marking the first time the virus mutated to favor mammal-to-mammal transmission, according to Science.

This is the deadliest outbreak in the U.S. since the 2014-2015 outbreak, which killed 50 million domestic birds—he 2014-2015 outbreak lasted between December 2014 and June 2015, and the first case of the current outbreak was reported in January 2022.

Crucial Quote

“he continuous circulation of the virus poses great risks and may result in more spillover events in mammals,”sabella Monne, a veterinarian at IZSVe, an institute with the Italian National Public Health Service, told the Bulletin. “ virus that is able to transmit to mammals needs to be stopped before it may become a matter of public health concern, as we learnt from the SARS-CoV2 lesson.”

Symptoms In Humans

According to guidelines issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for animal handlers, signs of bird flu include difficulty breathing, vomiting, fever, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, eye infection, muscle aches, abdominal pain and pneumonia or other severe respiratory infections. The CDC states lab testing is needed to diagnose bird flu in humans and cannot be done by symptoms alone as they mimic symptoms of other diseases and infections. Physicians diagnose bird flu by swabbing the nose or throat, and the results are more accurate if done within the first few days of the illness. The lower respiratory tract (i.e. the lungs, bronchi and windpipes) may be tested in severely ill patients for diagnoses.

How To Stay Safe

As of January, only 240 cases of bird flu in humans have been reported worldwide since 2003, according to WHO. The only human case found in the U.S. was reported in Colorado in April 2022, and the patient recovered after a few days. They were treated with oseltamivir, an antiviral flu medication. To avoid infection, the CDC recommends avoiding direct contact with wild birds, reporting dead birds that appear to be sick to authorities, safely preparing poultry and cooking it all the way through and getting a yearly flu vaccination. Bird owners and hunters should use protective gear like gloves and N95 masks; wash their hands thoroughly; avoid touching the nose, mouth and eyes after coming into contact with birds and change their clothes before coming in contact with any bird.

Are Bird Flu Vaccines Available?

There are a few vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Adjuvented, manufactured by ID Biomedical Corporation was approved by the FDA in 2013 for use in those 18 years and older who are at an increased risk of exposure. Manufactured by Seqirus, Audenz was FDA approved in 2020 and can be used in people six months and older for protection against H5N1. However, the U.S. has a small stockpile of H5N1 and H7N9 bird flu vaccines, so if an outbreak were to happen among humans, the amount of vaccines would not be enough to withstand the outbreak. There are concerns that once the disease mutates into new variants, old stockpiled vaccines may not be as effective. However, a 2019 study found H5N1 vaccines made in 2004 were still effective 12 years later. A separate study in 2017 found H5N1 vaccines made in 2004 and 2005 protected against the H5N2 virus in ferrets in 2014.

A 6-Month Delay After Outbreak?

The government plans to mass produce vaccines once an outbreak occurs, which can take at least six months to create enough for the entire population. A majority of the approved vaccines are created by incubating doses in chicken eggs, but the disease’ rate of fatality among poultry poses an issue for these vaccines. The makers of Audenz, the only non-egg-based FDA approved H5N1 vaccine, expect to have 150 million vaccines ready within six months of an announcement of a bird flu pandemic. However, as the New York Timespointed out, there are seven billion people in the world. This means only 2% of the world’ population will receive the Audenz vaccine within the first six months of a potential pandemic. Scientists and researchers are attempting to get mRNA-based influenza vaccines FDA approved, similar to Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid vaccines, because mRNA vaccines take less time to produce.

Effect On Egg Prices

The disease is very contagious among birds. Although certain species like ducks may not get sick, bird flu can be extremely deadly for domesticated birds like chickens, with a mortality rate between 90% and 100%. Millions of egg-laying hens have been affected by the bird flu, resulting in an egg shortage. More than 43 million hens died by the end of December 2022 due to the bird flu or as a result of depopulation, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It found the average egg price during the week of Christmas 2022 was 210% higher than the average the same time a year before. Although inflation does play a part in the rise in egg prices, the impact of the bird flu is even bigger, causing the average cost of a dozen eggs in California to climb to $5.02. “vian flu has been an economic disaster for the business and the consumer,”nvestment banker Walter Kunish, who tracks the market for HTS Commodities, told Forbes. Chickens used for meat are not as affected by this disease, so the price of chicken meat hasn’ drastically changed. However, according to Amy Hagerman, an assistant professor at Oklahoma State University who specializes in agricultural economics, egg-laying hens are more at risk.

Can Pets Get Bird Flu ? Here’ What To Know,1681171200000,"Topline

Bird flu has spread between farm mammals in at least five states this year, and health agencies note pets like cats and dogs may be susceptible if they’e exposed to infected animals, though transmission to humans is unlikely.

Key Facts

Bird flu (also called avian flu) refers to a group of potentially deadly infections caused by avian influenza Type A viruses, and typically infects domestic poultry and wild migratory birds.

Although bird flu usually spreads between birds, it is possible for the infection to spread to mammals like domestic dogs and cats, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Domestic animals can become infected with bird flu if they eat or are exposed to sick or dead birds that are infected with the virus, and cats are the most susceptible domestic animals to become infected, according to the Kentucky Department for Public Health.

Since 2022, the U.S. has reported over 200 cases of bird flu in mammals, and several other countries have reported bird flu in domestic animals, including cats in Thailand, Germany, Poland and South Korea, and dogs in Canada and Italy.

Although it can occur, the chances of people catching bird flu from their pet dogs and cats are extremely unlikely, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Symptoms of bird flu in cats and dogs include a fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing, conjunctivitis (or pink eye)and neurological signs like seizures and tremors, and death is also a possible outcome.

Key Background

The Department of Agriculture announced bird flu was detected in dairy herds in Texas and Kansas on March 25. The agency later discovered dairy herds in Michigan, New Mexico and Idaho were also infected. Minnesota also reported a case of bird flu in a goat on March 20, which is the first case of infection in a “omestic ruminant”n the U.S., referring to many common grazing mammals in the U.S., including domestic cattle, according to the AVMA. On April 1, Texas officials announced the second known case of a type of bird flu called H5N1 in a person in the U.S., which was spread from exposure to cattle. The first occurred in 2022 when a person in Colorado contracted the disease from infected poultry. This case “oes not change the risk for the general public, which remains low,”ccording to the Texas Department of State Health Services’nnouncement. The patient reported eye redness as their only symptom, and is being treated with antiviral medication, the CDC reports. Though human infection is rare, there have been 887 reported cases between January 2003 and February 2024 in 23 countries, according to the World Health Organization. The virus can be extremely dangerous for humans who are infected, as 52% of these cases ended in death.

Tangent

A veterinarian in New York City was infected with H5N7, a type of bird flu virus, after caring for infected cats admitted into an animal shelter in November 2016, according to a study published in Clinical Infectious Disease. The cat died a few days later, and further testing discovered the virus spread throughout the facility to several other shelter cats, though other animals like dogs weren’ infected. No one who came into contact with these cats—ncluding the 165 volunteers and employees, and over 180 adopters—ere suspected of having the illness, except for the visiting veterinarian. This person had prolonged exposure without face protections with infected cats and their secretions. The veterinarian had a mild illness, which included a sore throat, cough and muscle pain, though they were treated and cured with medication without hospitalization.

Surprising Fact

The Food and Drug Administration has approved a few bird flu vaccines for humans. The U.S. has a small stockpile of vaccines for two bird flu viruses (H5N1 and H7N9), but it wouldn’ be enough to vaccinate all Americans if an outbreak were to happen among humans. If an outbreak among humans does occur, the government plans to mass produce vaccines, which can take at least six months to make enough for the entire population.

WHO Warns Threat Of Bird Flu Spreading To Humans Is ‘reat Concern’,1681776000000,"Topline

A top World Health Organization official warned there’ an increasing threat of human-to-human bird flu transmission Thursday, as the virus has increasingly mutated to spread to humans from other mammals—hough there’ still no evidence of the virus passing between people.

Key Facts

Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist for the World Health Organization, emphasized the severity of the global spread of H5N1 bird flu during a press conference Thursday, noting the virus’ “xtremely high”ortality rate in humans.

Between January 2003 and March 28, 2024, WHO has reported 888 human cases of bird flu infection, and 52% were fatal, according to the organization’ latest report.

The current global bird flu outbreak began in 2020 after a reemergence in Europe, and has led to the deaths of millions of birds, but it’ evolved and has increasingly been infecting mammals like cows, which may mean it could spread between humans since cows have similar body structures, something Farrar describes as a “reat concern.”

Although there have been no known human-to-human transmissions, Farrar warned about the possibility of the virus mutating and spreading between humans, since it’ already evolved and has spread from to humans from other mammals.

He noted because the spread of bird flu has increased over the past one to two years, it’ now labeled as a “lobal zoonotic animal pandemic”—r a pandemic driven by diseases that spread between people and animals—nd he said efforts were underway to “mmediately respond with access equitably to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics”f human-to-human transmission begins.

Forbes has reached out to WHO for further comment.

Key Background

Some worry bird flu may become the next major pandemic because of the way it’ spreading to cows, since they’e close in species to humans, while the high death rate is also a major cause of concern should a pandemic break out. Because there isn’ any evidence it’ spreading between humans, a bird flu pandemic may be unlikely, Joe DeRisi, a biochemist at the University of California, San Franciscosaid. However, he noted there’ “eason to be cautious”ecause it is possible the virus may mutate and become transmissible among people. A bird flu outbreak among cattle and goats believed to be caused by infected birds affecting several U.S. states including Texas, Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota and Kansas has raised concerns among experts since these species aren’ typically susceptible to the virus. Texas officials reported earlier this month a man contracted bird flu after coming into contact with an infected dairy cow. This is the second time a human has contracted H5N1 bird flu in the United States. The first happened in 2022 when a person in Colorado contracted the disease from infected poultry. Farrar called the infections in the U.S. a “uge concern,”rging public health officials to continue closely monitoring the situation “ecause it may evolve into transmitting in different ways.”

Tangent

If a bird flu pandemic does occur, the Food and Drug Administration has approved a few vaccines for humans, so the U.S. has a small supply of vaccines available. However, it’ not enough to protect all Americans. The government has stated it plans to mass produce these vaccines in the event of a human outbreak, which can take at least six months to make enough for the entire population.

"Bird Flu ( H5N1 ) Explained: 70 People In Colorado Monitored For Illness, Local Officials Say",1683590400000,"Topline

Here’ the latest news about a global outbreak of H5N1 bird flu that started in 2020, and recently spread among cattle in U.S. states and marine mammals across the world, which has health officials closely monitoring it and experts concerned the virus could mutate and eventually spread to humans, where it has proven rare but deadly.

Timeline

May 9Some 70 people in Colorado are being monitored for bird flu due to potential exposure, and will be tested for the virus if they show any symptoms, the Colorado Department of Public Health told Forbes—t was not immediately clear how or when the people were potentially exposed.

May 1The Department of Agriculture said it tested 30 grocery store ground beef products for bird flu and they all came back negative, reaffirming the meat supply is safe.

May 1The Food and Drug Administration confirmed dairy products are still safe to consume, announcing it tested grocery store samples of products like infant formula, toddler milk, sour cream and cottage cheese, and no live traces of the bird flu virus were found, although some dead remnants were found in some of the food—hough none in the baby products.

April 30Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization's Global Influenza Programme, said during a news briefing ""there is a risk for cows in other countries to be getting infected,"" with the bird flu virus, since it’ commonly spread through the movement of migratory birds.

April 29The Department of Agriculture told Forbes it will begin testing ground beef samples from grocery stores in states with cow outbreaks, and test ground beef cooked at different temperatures and infected with the virus to determine if it's safe to eat.

April 24The USDAsaid cow-to-cow transmission may be occurring due to the cows coming into contact with raw milk—nd warned against humans and other animals, including pets, consuming unpasteurized milk to prevent potential infection.

April 18Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist for the World Health Organization, said during a press conference the threat of bird flu spreading between humans was a “reat concern,”ince it’ evolved and has increasingly been infecting mammals (on land and sea), which means it could possibly spread to humans.

April 1The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionreported the second U.S. human case of bird flu in a Texas dairy farmer who became infected after contracting the virus from infected dairy cows, but said the person was already recovering.

Can Bird Flu Spread Between Humans?

Bird flu doesn’ “ransmit easily from person-to-person,”according to the World Health Organization. Bird flu rarely affects humans, and most previous cases came from close contact with infected poultry, according to the CDC. Because human-to-human spread of bird flu poses “andemic potential,”ach human case is investigated to rule out this type of infection. Though none have been confirmed, there are a few global cases—one in the U.S.—here human-to-human transmission of bird flu was thought to be “robable,”ncluding in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Pakistan.

Is Bird Flu Fatal To Humans?

It is very deadly. Between January 2003 and March 28, 2024 there have been 888 human cases of bird flu infection in humans, according to a report by the World Health Organization. Of those 888 cases, 463 (52%) died. To date, only two people in the U.S. have contracted H5N1 bird flu, and they both were infected after coming into contact with sick animals. The most recent case was a dairy worker in Texas who became ill in March after interacting with sick dairy cows, though he only experienced pink eye. The first incident happened in 2022 when a person in Colorado contracted the disease from infected poultry, and fully recovered.

Is It Safe To Drink Milk Infected With Bird Flu?

Raw, unpasteurized milk is unsafe to drink, but pasteurized milk is fine, according to the FDA. Bird flu has been detected in both unpasteurized and pasteurized milk, but the FDA recommends manufacturers against making and selling unpasteurized milk since there’ a possibility consuming it may cause bird flu infection. However, the virus remnants in pasteurized milk have been deactivated by the heat during the pasteurization process, so this type of milk is still believed safe to consume.

Is It Safe To Consume Meat Infected With Bird Flu?

The CDC warns against eating raw meat or eggs infected with bird flu because of the possibility of transmission. However, no human has ever been infected with bird flu from eating properly prepared and cooked meat, according to the agency. The possibility of infected meat entering the food supply is “xtremely low”ue to rigorous inspection, so properly handled and cooked meat is safe to eat, according to the USDA. To know when meat is properly cooked, whole beef cuts must be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit, ground meat must be 160 degrees and poultry must be cooked to 165 degrees. Rare and medium rare steaks fall below this temperature. Properly cooked eggs with an internal temperature of 165 degrees fahrenheit kills bacteria and viruses including bird flu, according to the CDC. “t doesn’ matter if they may or may not have [avian] influenza…unny eggs and rare pieces of meat”re never recommended, Francisco Diez-Gonzalez, director and professor for the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, told Forbes. To “lay it safe,”onsumers should only eat fully cooked eggs and make sure “he yolks are firm with no runny parts,”aisy May, veterinary surgeon with U.K.-based company Medivet, said.

What Are Bird Flu Symptoms In Humans?

Symptoms of bird flu include a fever, cough, headache, chills, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, runny nose, congestion, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, pink eye, muscle aches and headache. However, the CDC advises it can’ be diagnosed based on symptoms alone, and laboratory testing is needed. This typically includes swabbing the nose or throat (the upper respiratory tract), or the lower respiratory tract for critically ill patients.

How Is Bird Flu Affecting Egg Prices?

This year’ egg prices have increased as production decreased due to bird flu outbreaks among poultry, according to the USDA. A dozen large, grade A eggs in the U.S. costed around $2.99 in March, up almost a dollar from the fall. However, this price is down from a record $4.82 in January 2023, which was also spiked by bird flu outbreaks. Earlier this month, Cal-Maine Foods—he country’ largest egg producer—emporarily halted egg production after over one million egg-laying hens and chickens were killed after being infected with bird flu.

Why Do Poultry Farmers Kill Chickens With Bird Flu?

Once chickens have been infected with bird flu, farmers quickly kill them to help control the spread of the virus, since bird flu is highly contagious and fatal in poultry. The USDA pays farmers for all birds and eggs that have to be killed because of bird flu, as an incentive to responsibly try and curb the spread of the disease. The USDA has spent over $1 billion in bird flu compensation for farmers since 2022, according to the nonprofit Food & Environment Reporting Network.

Is There A Vaccine For The Bird Flu (h5n1)?

The FDA has approved a few bird flu vaccines for humans. The U.S. has a stockpile of vaccines for H5N1 bird flu, but it wouldn’ be enough to vaccinate all Americans if an outbreak were to happen among humans. If a human outbreak does occur, the government plans to mass produce vaccines, which can take at least six months to make enough for the entire population. Sequirs, the maker of one of the approved vaccines, expects to have 150 million vaccines ready within six months of an announcement of a human bird flu pandemic. Although there are approved vaccines for other variants designed for birds, there are none for the H5N1 variant circulating. However, the USDA began trials on H5N1 animal-specific vaccines in 2023.

Key Background

As of April 30, more than 90 million poultry (primarily chickens) in 48 states have been euthanized because of bird flu since 2022, and 36 dairy cow herds across nine states have tested positive, according to data from the CDC (unlike chickens, cows appear to recover from the virus). The USDA believes wild migratory birds are the original source of the cow outbreaks that recently has experts concerned it may mutate and spread more easily in humans, though the CDC said its risk to the public remains low.

Bird flu has devastated bird populations, and 67 countries reported the deaths of 131 million poultry in 2022 alone. Although bird flu typically infects wild birds and poultry, it’ spread to other animals during the outbreak, and at least 10 countries have reported outbreaks in mammals since 2022. Around 17,400 elephant seal pups died from bird flu in Argentina in 2023, and at least 24,000 sea lions died in South America the same year.

Bird Flu ( H5N1 ) Explained: Study Finds First Known Case Of Mammal-To-Mammal Transnational Transmission,1685923200000,"Topline

Here’ the latest news about a global outbreak of H5N1 bird flu that started in 2020, and recently spread among cattle in U.S. states and marine mammals across the world, which has health officials closely monitoring it and experts concerned the virus could mutate and eventually spread to humans, where it has proven rare but deadly.

Timeline

June 5A new study examining the 2023 bird flu outbreak in South America that killed around 17,400 elephant seal pups and 24,000 sea lions found the disease spread between the animals in several countries, the first known case of transnational virus mammal-to-mammal bird flu transmission.

May 30Another human case of bird flu has been detected in a dairy farm worker in Michigan—hough the cases aren’ connected—nd this is the first person in the U.S. to report respiratory symptoms connected to bird flu, though their symptoms are “esolving,”according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

May 23A new study with mice suggests that drinking infected milk can spread the disease—nd that a certain type of pasteurization may not always be effective in killing the virus.

May 22Michigan reported bird flu in a farmworker—he second U.S. human case tied to transmission from dairy cows—hough the worker had a mild infection and has since recovered.

May 21Australia reported its first human case of bird flu after a child became infected in March after traveling to India, though the child has since recovered after suffering from a “evere infection,”according to the Victorian Department of Health.

May 16The USDA conducted a study, and discovered that after high levels of the virus was injected into beef, no trace was left after the meat was cooked medium to well done, though the virus was found in meat cooked to lower temperatures.

May 14The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionreleased influenza A waste water data for the weeks ending in April 27 and May 4, and found several states like Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois and Kansas had unusually high levels, though the agency isn’ sure if the virus came from humans or animals, and isn’ able to differentiate between influenza A subtypes, meaning the H5N1 virus or other subtypes may have been detected.

May 10The Food and Drug Administration announced it will commit an additional $8 million to ensure the commercial milk supply is safe, while the Department of Agriculture said it will pay up to $28,000 per farm to help mitigate the spread of the disease, totaling around $98 million in funds.

May 9Some 70 people in Colorado are being monitored for bird flu due to potential exposure, and will be tested for the virus if they show any symptoms, the Colorado Department of Public Health told Forbes—t was not immediately clear how or when the people were potentially exposed.

May 1The Department of Agriculture said it tested 30 grocery store ground beef products for bird flu and they all came back negative, reaffirming the meat supply is safe.

May 1The Food and Drug Administration confirmed dairy products are still safe to consume, announcing it tested grocery store samples of products like infant formula, toddler milk, sour cream and cottage cheese, and no live traces of the bird flu virus were found, although some dead remnants were found in some of the food—hough none in the baby products.

April 30Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization's Global Influenza Programme, said during a news briefing ""there is a risk for cows in other countries to be getting infected,"" with the bird flu virus, since it’ commonly spread through the movement of migratory birds.

April 29The Department of Agriculture told Forbes it will begin testing ground beef samples from grocery stores in states with cow outbreaks, and test ground beef cooked at different temperatures and infected with the virus to determine if it's safe to eat.

April 24The USDAsaid cow-to-cow transmission may be occurring due to the cows coming into contact with raw milk—nd warned against humans and other animals, including pets, consuming unpasteurized milk to prevent potential infection.

April 18Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist for the World Health Organization, said during a press conference the threat of bird flu spreading between humans was a “reat concern,”ince it’ evolved and has increasingly been infecting mammals (on land and sea), which means it could possibly spread to humans.

April 1The CDC reported the second U.S. human case of bird flu in a Texas dairy farmer who became infected after contracting the virus from infected dairy cows, but said the person was already recovering.

Can Bird Flu Spread Between Humans?

Bird flu doesn’ “ransmit easily from person-to-person,”according to the World Health Organization. Bird flu rarely affects humans, and most previous cases came from close contact with infected poultry, according to the CDC. Because human-to-human spread of bird flu poses “andemic potential,”ach human case is investigated to rule out this type of infection. Though none have been confirmed, there are a few global cases—one in the U.S.—here human-to-human transmission of bird flu was thought to be “robable,”ncluding in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Pakistan.

Is Bird Flu Fatal To Humans?

It is very deadly. Between January 2003 and March 28, 2024 there have been 888 human cases of bird flu infection in humans, according to a report by the World Health Organization. Of those 888 cases, 463 (52%) died. To date, only two people in the U.S. have contracted H5N1 bird flu, and they both were infected after coming into contact with sick animals. The most recent case was a dairy worker in Texas who became ill in March after interacting with sick dairy cows, though he only experienced pink eye. The first incident happened in 2022 when a person in Colorado contracted the disease from infected poultry, and fully recovered.

Is It Safe To Drink Milk Infected With Bird Flu?

Raw, unpasteurized milk is unsafe to drink, but pasteurized milk is fine, according to the FDA. Bird flu has been detected in both unpasteurized and pasteurized milk, but the FDA recommends manufacturers against making and selling unpasteurized milk since there’ a possibility consuming it may cause bird flu infection. However, the virus remnants in pasteurized milk have been deactivated by the heat during the pasteurization process, so this type of milk is still believed safe to consume.

Is It Safe To Consume Meat Infected With Bird Flu?

The CDC warns against eating raw meat or eggs from animals “onfirmed or suspected”f having bird flu because of the possibility of transmission. However, no human has ever been infected with bird flu from eating properly prepared and cooked meat, according to the agency. The possibility of infected meat entering the food supply is “xtremely low”ue to rigorous inspection, so properly handled and cooked meat is safe to eat, according to the USDA. To know when meat is properly cooked, whole beef cuts must be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit, ground meat must be 160 degrees and poultry must be cooked to 165 degrees. Rare and medium rare steaks fall below this temperature. Properly cooked eggs with an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit kills bacteria and viruses including bird flu, according to the CDC. “t doesn’ matter if they may or may not have [avian] influenza…unny eggs and rare pieces of meat”re never recommended, Francisco Diez-Gonzalez, director and professor for the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, told Forbes. To “lay it safe,”onsumers should only eat fully cooked eggs and make sure “he yolks are firm with no runny parts,”aisy May, veterinary surgeon with U.K.-based company Medivet, said.

What Are Bird Flu Symptoms In Humans?

Symptoms of bird flu include a fever, cough, headache, chills, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, runny nose, congestion, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, pink eye, muscle aches and headache. However, the CDC advises it can’ be diagnosed based on symptoms alone, and laboratory testing is needed. This typically includes swabbing the nose or throat (the upper respiratory tract), or the lower respiratory tract for critically ill patients.

How Is Bird Flu Affecting Egg Prices?

This year’ egg prices have increased as production decreased due to bird flu outbreaks among poultry, according to the USDA. A dozen large, grade A eggs in the U.S. costed around $2.99 in March, up almost a dollar from the fall. However, this price is down from a record $4.82 in January 2023, which was also spiked by bird flu outbreaks. Earlier this month, Cal-Maine Foods—he country’ largest egg producer—emporarily halted egg production after over one million egg-laying hens and chickens were killed after being infected with bird flu.

Why Do Poultry Farmers Kill Chickens With Bird Flu?

Once chickens have been infected with bird flu, farmers quickly kill them to help control the spread of the virus, since bird flu is highly contagious and fatal in poultry. The USDA pays farmers for all birds and eggs that have to be killed because of bird flu, as an incentive to responsibly try and curb the spread of the disease. The USDA has spent over $1 billion in bird flu compensation for farmers since 2022, according to the nonprofit Food & Environment Reporting Network.

Is There A Vaccine For The Bird Flu (h5n1)?

The FDA has approved a few bird flu vaccines for humans. The U.S. has a stockpile of vaccines for H5N1 bird flu, but it wouldn’t be enough to vaccinate all Americans if an outbreak were to happen among humans. If a human outbreak does occur, the government plans to mass produce vaccines, which can take at least six months to make enough for the entire population. CSL Seqirus, the maker of one of the approved vaccines, expects to have 150 million vaccines ready within six months of an announcement of a human bird flu pandemic. Although there are approved vaccines for other variants designed for birds, there are none for the H5N1 variant circulating. However, the USDA began trials on H5N1 animal-specific vaccines in 2023.

The USDA believes wild migratory birds are the original source of the cow outbreaks that recently has experts concerned it may mutate and spread more easily in humans, though the CDC said its risk to the public remains low. Farrar called the cattle infections in the U.S. a “huge concern,” urging public health officials to continue closely monitoring the situation “because it may evolve into transmitting in different ways.” The increased number of mammal bird flu infections since 2022 “could indicate that the virus is looking for new hosts, and of course, moving closer to people,” Andrea Garcia, vice president of science, medicine and public health for the American Medical Association, said. The first report of a walrus dying from bird flu was detected in April on one of Norway’s Arctic Islands, and the first U.S. dolphin infected with bird flu died back in 2022, according to a report published April 18. More than 10 human bird flu cases were reported to the World Health Organization in 2023, and all but one survived. Bird flu has devastated bird populations, and 67 countries reported the deaths of 131 million poultry in 2022 alone.

Here’ Why COVID Measures Like Masking And New Ones Like Safety Goggles Could Return If A Bird Flu Pandemic Is Declared,1687564800000,"Topline

An ongoing bird flu outbreak among U.S. dairy cows has led to three confirmed human cases in dairy workers, and although there aren’ any confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, experts warn safety measures like masks, vaccines and safety goggles will be needed if a pandemic is declared due to the virus’ deadly nature.

Key Facts

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Forbes it’ monitoring human and animal exposure to H5N1 bird flu and watching the situation carefully, though “he current public health risk is low.”

Although rare, bird flu typically affects humans who’e come in contact with infected birds, and there aren’ any confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission.

The virus may spread from animals to humans through airborne transmission and through contact with infected surfaces, Dr. Jessica Justman, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at Columbia University, told Forbes, though the exact transmission process isn’ fully understood.

Former CDC director Robert Redfield—ho helped oversee the agency during the COVID-19 pandemic—told NewsNation earlier this month a bird flu pandemic is inevitable, so “t’ not a question of if, it’ a question of when.”

Redfield brought up bird flu’ high death rate as a cause for concern if a pandemic were to be declared: Of the 889 confirmed human cases between 2003 and May, 52% resulted in death, according to data from the World Health Organization.

WHO defines pandemics as large-scale outbreaks that can claim millions of lives, disrupt societies and devastate economies; it won’ declare a bird flu pandemic until the virus causes several outbreaks in at least one country and spreads to another with high death rates in at least one segment of the population.

Earlier this year, the CDC began including H5N1 in its influenza A wastewater surveillance data in an effort to better monitor the spread of bird flu, but due to limitations, it’ not distinguishable between other influenza A viruses, and testing can’ determine the source of the virus, so it could come from a human, animal or animal byproduct.

What Safety Measures May Be Put In Place If A Bird Flu Pandemic Is Declared?

Experts have cautioned that if a bird flu pandemic is declared, safety measures will need to be put in place to mitigate the spread. Dr. Donal Bisanzio, a senior epidemiologist with the nonprofit research institute RTI International, told Forbes methods like masking and social distancing should be the first implemented. “hose are all the kinds of interventions we need to put in place to buy time for the vaccine,”isanzio said. Justman told Forbes new methods like protective eyewear may be effective safety measures, especially among farm workers who have daily contact with potentially infectious animals. This is because all three U.S. dairy farmers infected with bird flu had eye-related symptoms like pink eye and irritation, indicating the virus may spread when humans touch or rub their eyes with infected hands. She also pointed to a recent CDC bird flu study that found ferrets—hat as mammals have similar respiratory tracts to humans—ecame infected after eye exposure. Dr. Maciej Boni, an epidemiologist and professor at Temple University, told Forbes he doesn’ think safety measures for a bird flu pandemic will be similar to those put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic because experts don’ know yet how the virus will behave if it mutates and begins transmitting between humans. “5N1 is not 10 or 20 times more deadly [than COVID-19], it’ 1,000 times more deadly,”oni said.

Are There Human Bird Flu Vaccines?

There are several FDA-approved bird flu vaccines, including ones made by Sequirs and Biomedical Corporation of Quebec, a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. The U.S. has a stockpile of FDA-approved bird flu vaccines, but they’e not enough to vaccinate the entire country. Sequirs said it expects to have 150 million vaccines ready within six months of an announcement of a human bird flu pandemic. “ think the right course of action is to simply premanufacture several 100 million doses of vaccines and just have them ready,”oni said regarding pandemic preparation. Sequirs also announced in May it was selected by a brand of the Department of Health and Human Services to create almost 5 million doses of its bird flu vaccines as a form of pre-pandemic preparedness. Bisanzio pointed out better communication between public health agencies and the public will be needed for a bird flu vaccine rollout because “here was a lot of misinformation [about the COVID-19 pandemic], and that caused issues with the vaccine rollout, and some people didn’ even want to get a vaccine,”e said.

Key Background

As of May 21, more than 97 million poultry (primarily chickens) in 48 states have been euthanized because of bird flu since 2022, and cases have been confirmed in 118 dairy cow herds across 12 states, according to data from the CDC (unlike chickens, cows appear to recover from the virus). The Department of Agriculture believes wild migratory birds are the original source of the cow outbreaks that recently has experts concerned the virus may mutate and spread more easily in humans. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist for WHO, called the cattle infections in the U.S. a “uge concern,”rging public health officials to continue closely monitoring the situation “ecause it may evolve into transmitting in different ways.”hough there’ no evidence a human has contracted bird flu from eating infected meat, the USDAurges people to eat meat prepared at safe temperatures. To be properly cooked, whole beef cuts must be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit, ground meat must be cooked to 160 degrees and poultry must be cooked to 165 degrees. Rare and medium rare steaks fall below this temperature. Properly cooked eggs with an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit kill bacteria and viruses including bird flu, according to the CDC. Consuming unpasteurized dairy products is also advised against.

June 25Finland said it plans to begin vaccinating vulnerable populations like farm workers against bird flu as early as next week using 10,000 vaccine series—ach with two doses—cquired as part of a European Union deal with vaccine maker CSL Seqirus to provide up to 40 million vaccines to 15 countries.

June 11The World Health Organizationannounced a four-year-old child in India was infected with H9N2 bird flu— different flu strain from H5N1—ut recovered after suffering from seizures, respiratory distress, fever and abdominal cramps; H9N2 has infected around 100 people globally since 1998, and this is the second human case in India.

June 6Dozens of cows infected with bird flu have either died or been slaughtered in Colorado, Ohio, Michigan, South Carolina and Texas, which is unusual since—nlike poultry—ows cost more to slaughter and around 90% usually make a full recovery, Reuters reported.

June 5A new study examining the 2023 bird flu outbreak in South America that killed around 17,400 elephant seal pups and 24,000 sea lions found the disease spread between the animals in several countries, the first known case of transnational virus mammal-to-mammal bird flu transmission.

May 30Another human case of bird flu has been detected in a dairy farm worker in Michigan—hough the cases aren’ connected—nd this is the first person in the U.S. to report respiratory symptoms connected to bird flu, though their symptoms are “esolving,”according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

May 23A new study with mice suggests that drinking infected milk can spread the disease—nd that a certain type of pasteurization may not always be effective in killing the virus.

May 22Michigan reported bird flu in a farmworker—he second U.S. human case tied to transmission from dairy cows—hough the worker had a mild infection and has since recovered.

May 21Australia reported its first human case of bird flu after a child became infected in March after traveling to India, though the child has since recovered after suffering from a “evere infection,”according to the Victorian Department of Health.

May 16The USDA conducted a study, and discovered that after high levels of the virus was injected into beef, no trace was left after the meat was cooked medium to well done, though the virus was found in meat cooked to lower temperatures.

May 14The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionreleased influenza A waste water data for the weeks ending in April 27 and May 4, and found several states like Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois and Kansas had unusually high levels, though the agency isn’ sure if the virus came from humans or animals, and isn’ able to differentiate between influenza A subtypes, meaning the H5N1 virus or other subtypes may have been detected.

May 10The Food and Drug Administration announced it will commit an additional $8 million to ensure the commercial milk supply is safe, while the Department of Agriculture said it will pay up to $28,000 per farm to help mitigate the spread of the disease, totaling around $98 million in funds.

May 9Some 70 people in Colorado are being monitored for bird flu due to potential exposure, and will be tested for the virus if they show any symptoms, the Colorado Department of Public Health told Forbes—t was not immediately clear how or when the people were potentially exposed.

May 1The Department of Agriculture said it tested 30 grocery store ground beef products for bird flu and they all came back negative, reaffirming the meat supply is safe.

May 1The Food and Drug Administration confirmed dairy products are still safe to consume, announcing it tested grocery store samples of products like infant formula, toddler milk, sour cream and cottage cheese, and no live traces of the bird flu virus were found, although some dead remnants were found in some of the food—hough none in the baby products.

April 30Wenqing Zhang, head of WHO's Global Influenza Programme, said during a news briefing ""there is a risk for cows in other countries to be getting infected,"" with the bird flu virus, since it’ commonly spread through the movement of migratory birds.

April 29The Department of Agriculture told Forbes it will begin testing ground beef samples from grocery stores in states with cow outbreaks, and test ground beef cooked at different temperatures and infected with the virus to determine if it's safe to eat.

April 24The USDAsaid cow-to-cow transmission may be occurring due to the cows coming into contact with raw milk—nd warned against humans and other animals, including pets, consuming unpasteurized milk to prevent potential infection.

April 18Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist for the World Health Organization, said during a press conference the threat of bird flu spreading between humans was a “reat concern,”ince it’ evolved and has increasingly been infecting mammals (on land and sea), which means it could possibly spread to humans.

April 1The CDC reported the second U.S. human case of bird flu in a Texas dairy farmer who became infected after contracting the virus from infected dairy cows, but said the person was already recovering.

Can Bird Flu Spread Between Humans?

Bird flu doesn’ “ransmit easily from person-to-person,”according to the World Health Organization. Bird flu rarely affects humans, and most previous cases came from close contact with infected poultry, according to the CDC. Because human-to-human spread of bird flu poses “andemic potential,”ach human case is investigated to rule out this type of infection. Though none have been confirmed, there are a few global cases—one in the U.S.—here human-to-human transmission of bird flu was thought to be “robable,”ncluding in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Pakistan.

Is Bird Flu Fatal To Humans?

It is very deadly. Between January 2003 and March 28, 2024 there have been 888 human cases of bird flu infection in humans, according to a report by the World Health Organization. Of those 888 cases, 463 (52%) died. To date, only two people in the U.S. have contracted H5N1 bird flu, and they both were infected after coming into contact with sick animals. The most recent case was a dairy worker in Texas who became ill in March after interacting with sick dairy cows, though he only experienced pink eye. The first incident happened in 2022 when a person in Colorado contracted the disease from infected poultry, and fully recovered.

Is It Safe To Drink Milk Infected With Bird Flu?

Raw, unpasteurized milk is unsafe to drink, but pasteurized milk is fine, according to the FDA. Bird flu has been detected in both unpasteurized and pasteurized milk, but the FDA recommends manufacturers against making and selling unpasteurized milk since there’ a possibility consuming it may cause bird flu infection. However, the virus remnants in pasteurized milk have been deactivated by the heat during the pasteurization process, so this type of milk is still believed safe to consume.

Is It Safe To Consume Meat Infected With Bird Flu?

The CDC warns against eating raw meat or eggs from animals “onfirmed or suspected”f having bird flu because of the possibility of transmission. However, no human has ever been infected with bird flu from eating properly prepared and cooked meat, according to the agency. The possibility of infected meat entering the food supply is “xtremely low”ue to rigorous inspection, so properly handled and cooked meat is safe to eat, according to the USDA. To know when meat is properly cooked, whole beef cuts must be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit, ground meat must be 160 degrees and poultry must be cooked to 165 degrees. Rare and medium rare steaks fall below this temperature. Properly cooked eggs with an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit kills bacteria and viruses including bird flu, according to the CDC. “t doesn’ matter if they may or may not have [avian] influenza…unny eggs and rare pieces of meat”re never recommended, Francisco Diez-Gonzalez, director and professor for the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, told Forbes. To “lay it safe,”onsumers should only eat fully cooked eggs and make sure “he yolks are firm with no runny parts,”aisy May, veterinary surgeon with U.K.-based company Medivet, said.

What Are Bird Flu Symptoms In Humans?

Symptoms of bird flu include a fever, cough, headache, chills, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, runny nose, congestion, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, pink eye, muscle aches and headache. However, the CDC advises it can’ be diagnosed based on symptoms alone, and laboratory testing is needed. This typically includes swabbing the nose or throat (the upper respiratory tract), or the lower respiratory tract for critically ill patients.

How Is Bird Flu Affecting Egg Prices?

This year’ egg prices have increased as production decreased due to bird flu outbreaks among poultry, according to the USDA. A dozen large, grade A eggs in the U.S. costed around $2.99 in March, up almost a dollar from the fall. However, this price is down from a record $4.82 in January 2023, which was also spiked by bird flu outbreaks. Earlier this month, Cal-Maine Foods—he country’ largest egg producer—emporarily halted egg production after over one million egg-laying hens and chickens were killed after being infected with bird flu.

Why Do Poultry Farmers Kill Chickens With Bird Flu?

Once chickens have been infected with bird flu, farmers quickly kill them to help control the spread of the virus, since bird flu is highly contagious and fatal in poultry. The USDA pays farmers for all birds and eggs that have to be killed because of bird flu, as an incentive to responsibly try and curb the spread of the disease. The USDA has spent over $1 billion in bird flu compensation for farmers since 2022, according to the nonprofit Food & Environment Reporting Network.

Is There A Vaccine For The Bird Flu (h5n1)?

The FDA has approved a few bird flu vaccines for humans. The U.S. has a stockpile of vaccines for H5N1 bird flu, but it wouldn’ be enough to vaccinate all Americans if an outbreak were to happen among humans. If a human outbreak does occur, the government plans to mass produce vaccines, which can take at least six months to make enough for the entire population. CSL Seqirus, the maker of one of the approved vaccines, expects to have 150 million vaccines ready within six months of an announcement of a human bird flu pandemic. Although there are approved vaccines for other variants designed for birds, there are none for the H5N1 variant circulating. However, the USDA began trials on H5N1 animal-specific vaccines in 2023.

Key Background

As of May 30, more than 92 million poultry (primarily chickens) in 48 states have been euthanized because of bird flu since 2022, and 57 dairy cow herds across nine states have tested positive, according to data from the CDC (unlike chickens, cows appear to recover from the virus). The USDA believes wild migratory birds are the original source of the cow outbreaks that recently has experts concerned it may mutate and spread more easily in humans, though the CDC said its risk to the public remains low. Farrar called the cattle infections in the U.S. a “uge concern,”rging public health officials to continue closely monitoring the situation “ecause it may evolve into transmitting in different ways.”he increased number of mammal bird flu infections since 2022 “ould indicate that the virus is looking for new hosts, and of course, moving closer to people,”ndrea Garcia, vice president of science, medicine and public health for the American Medical Association, said. The first report of a walrus dying from bird flu was detected in April on one of Norway’ Arctic Islands, and the first U.S. dolphin infected with bird flu died back in 2022, according to a report published April 18. More than 10 human bird flu cases were reported to the World Health Organization in 2023, and all but one survived. Bird flu has devastated bird populations, and 67 countries reported the deaths of 131 million poultry in 2022 alone. Although bird flu typically infects wild birds and poultry, it’ spread to other animals during the outbreak, and at least 10 countries have reported outbreaks in mammals since 2022. Around 17,400 elephant seal pups died from bird flu in Argentina in 2023, and at least 24,000 sea lions died in South America the same year. Besides cattle, bird flu has been detected in over 200 other mammals—ike seals, raccoons and bears—n the U.S. since 2022. Although rare, even domestic pets like dogs and cats are susceptible to the virus, and the FDA warns against giving unpasteurized milk to cats to avoid possible transmission.

Tangent

On June 5, WHO confirmed the first human death of a strain of bird flu that’ never before been seen in humans and is separate from H5N1. A 59-year-old man in Mexico contracted H5N2, and died on April 24 after being hospitalized and developing a fever, diarrhea, nausea, shortness of breath and general discomfort. Cases of H5N2 have been reported in poultry in Mexico, but the man had no history with poultry or animals, WHO said. It’ unclear how he became infected. He was bedridden for weeks prior to the infection, and suffered from several other health conditions.

Bird Flu ( H5N1 ) Explained: U.S. Human Infections Rise To 7,1689206400000,"Topline

Here’ the latest news about a global outbreak of H5N1 bird flu that started in 2020, and recently spread among cattle in U.S. states and marine mammals across the world, which has health officials closely monitoring it and experts concerned the virus could mutate and eventually spread to humans, where it has proven rare but deadly.

Timeline

July 12Colorado authorities announced three workers in a commercial egg operation have presumptive positive cases of bird flu, bringing the state’ count of known human infections up to as high as five—nd the national number to seven—hough authorities said none of the workers have been hospitalized, and showed “ommon respiratory infection symptoms”nd pink eye. It’ the first time multiple cases have been recorded at the same location.

July 3Colorado health officials confirmed the state’ second human case of bird flu in a dairy farm worker who has since recovered and only had mild symptoms, reporting pink eye.

June 25Finland said it plans to begin vaccinating vulnerable populations like farm workers against bird flu as early as next week using 10,000 vaccine series—ach with two doses—cquired as part of a European Union deal with vaccine maker CSL Seqirus to provide up to 40 million vaccines to 15 countries.

June 11The World Health Organizationannounced a four-year-old child in India was infected with H9N2 bird flu— different flu strain from H5N1—ut recovered after suffering from seizures, respiratory distress, fever and abdominal cramps; H9N2 has infected around 100 people globally since 1998, and this is the second human case in India.

June 6Dozens of cows infected with bird flu have either died or been slaughtered in Colorado, Ohio, Michigan, South Carolina and Texas, which is unusual since—nlike poultry—ows cost more to slaughter and around 90% usually make a full recovery, Reuters reported.

June 5A new study examining the 2023 bird flu outbreak in South America that killed around 17,400 elephant seal pups and 24,000 sea lions found the disease spread between the animals in several countries, the first known case of transnational virus mammal-to-mammal bird flu transmission.

May 30Another human case of bird flu has been detected in a dairy farm worker in Michigan—hough the cases aren’ connected—nd this is the first person in the U.S. to report respiratory symptoms connected to bird flu, though their symptoms are “esolving,”according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

May 23A new study with mice suggests that drinking infected milk can spread the disease—nd that a certain type of pasteurization may not always be effective in killing the virus.

May 22Michigan reported bird flu in a farmworker—he second U.S. human case tied to transmission from dairy cows—hough the worker had a mild infection and has since recovered.

May 21Australia reported its first human case of bird flu after a child became infected in March after traveling to India, though the child has since recovered after suffering from a “evere infection,”according to the Victorian Department of Health.

May 16The USDA conducted a study, and discovered that after high levels of the virus was injected into beef, no trace was left after the meat was cooked medium to well done, though the virus was found in meat cooked to lower temperatures.

May 14The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionreleased influenza A waste water data for the weeks ending in April 27 and May 4, and found several states like Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois and Kansas had unusually high levels, though the agency isn’ sure if the virus came from humans or animals, and isn’ able to differentiate between influenza A subtypes, meaning the H5N1 virus or other subtypes may have been detected.

May 10The Food and Drug Administration announced it will commit an additional $8 million to ensure the commercial milk supply is safe, while the Department of Agriculture said it will pay up to $28,000 per farm to help mitigate the spread of the disease, totaling around $98 million in funds.

May 9Some 70 people in Colorado are being monitored for bird flu due to potential exposure, and will be tested for the virus if they show any symptoms, the Colorado Department of Public Health told Forbes—t was not immediately clear how or when the people were potentially exposed.

May 1The Department of Agriculture said it tested 30 grocery store ground beef products for bird flu and they all came back negative, reaffirming the meat supply is safe.

May 1The Food and Drug Administration confirmed dairy products are still safe to consume, announcing it tested grocery store samples of products like infant formula, toddler milk, sour cream and cottage cheese, and no live traces of the bird flu virus were found, although some dead remnants were found in some of the food—hough none in the baby products.

April 30Wenqing Zhang, head of WHO's Global Influenza Programme, said during a news briefing ""there is a risk for cows in other countries to be getting infected,"" with the bird flu virus, since it’ commonly spread through the movement of migratory birds.

April 29The Department of Agriculture told Forbes it will begin testing ground beef samples from grocery stores in states with cow outbreaks, and test ground beef cooked at different temperatures and infected with the virus to determine if it's safe to eat.

April 24The USDAsaid cow-to-cow transmission may be occurring due to the cows coming into contact with raw milk—nd warned against humans and other animals, including pets, consuming unpasteurized milk to prevent potential infection.

April 18Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist for the World Health Organization, said during a press conference the threat of bird flu spreading between humans was a “reat concern,”ince it’ evolved and has increasingly been infecting mammals (on land and sea), which means it could possibly spread to humans.

April 1The CDC reported the second U.S. human case of bird flu in a Texas dairy farmer who became infected after contracting the virus from infected dairy cows, but said the person was already recovering.

Can Bird Flu Spread Between Humans?

Bird flu doesn’ “ransmit easily from person-to-person,”according to the World Health Organization. Bird flu rarely affects humans, and most previous cases came from close contact with infected poultry, according to the CDC. Because human-to-human spread of bird flu poses “andemic potential,”ach human case is investigated to rule out this type of infection. Though none have been confirmed, there are a few global cases—one in the U.S.—here human-to-human transmission of bird flu was thought to be “robable,”ncluding in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Pakistan.

Is Bird Flu Fatal To Humans?

It is very deadly. Between January 2003 and March 28, 2024 there have been 888 human cases of bird flu infection in humans, according to a report by the World Health Organization. Of those 888 cases, 463 (52%) died. To date, only two people in the U.S. have contracted H5N1 bird flu, and they both were infected after coming into contact with sick animals. The most recent case was a dairy worker in Texas who became ill in March after interacting with sick dairy cows, though he only experienced pink eye. The first incident happened in 2022 when a person in Colorado contracted the disease from infected poultry, and fully recovered.

Is It Safe To Drink Milk Infected With Bird Flu?

Raw, unpasteurized milk is unsafe to drink, but pasteurized milk is fine, according to the FDA. Bird flu has been detected in both unpasteurized and pasteurized milk, but the FDA recommends manufacturers against making and selling unpasteurized milk since there’ a possibility consuming it may cause bird flu infection. However, the virus remnants in pasteurized milk have been deactivated by the heat during the pasteurization process, so this type of milk is still believed safe to consume.

Is It Safe To Consume Meat Infected With Bird Flu?

The CDC warns against eating raw meat or eggs from animals “onfirmed or suspected”f having bird flu because of the possibility of transmission. However, no human has ever been infected with bird flu from eating properly prepared and cooked meat, according to the agency. The possibility of infected meat entering the food supply is “xtremely low”ue to rigorous inspection, so properly handled and cooked meat is safe to eat, according to the USDA. To know when meat is properly cooked, whole beef cuts must be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit, ground meat must be 160 degrees and poultry must be cooked to 165 degrees. Rare and medium rare steaks fall below this temperature. Properly cooked eggs with an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit kills bacteria and viruses including bird flu, according to the CDC. “t doesn’ matter if they may or may not have [avian] influenza…unny eggs and rare pieces of meat”re never recommended, Francisco Diez-Gonzalez, director and professor for the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, told Forbes. To “lay it safe,”onsumers should only eat fully cooked eggs and make sure “he yolks are firm with no runny parts,”aisy May, veterinary surgeon with U.K.-based company Medivet, said What Are Bird Flu Symptoms In Humans? Symptoms of bird flu include a fever, cough, headache, chills, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, runny nose, congestion, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, pink eye, muscle aches and headache. However, the CDC advises it can’t be diagnosed based on symptoms alone, and laboratory testing is needed. This typically includes swabbing the nose or throat (the upper respiratory tract), or the lower respiratory tract for critically ill patients. How Is Bird Flu Affecting Egg Prices? This year’s egg prices have increased as production decreased due to bird flu outbreaks among poultry, according to the USDA. A dozen large, grade A eggs in the U.S. costed around $2.99 in March, up almost a dollar from the fall. However, this price is down from a record $4.82 in January 2023, which was also spiked by bird flu outbreaks. Earlier this month, Cal-Maine Foods—the country’s largest egg producer—temporarily halted egg production after over one million egg-laying hens and chickens were killed after being infected with bird flu. Why Do Poultry Farmers Kill Chickens With Bird Flu? Once chickens have been infected with bird flu, farmers quickly kill them to help control the spread of the virus, since bird flu is highly contagious and fatal in poultry. The USDA pays farmers for all birds and eggs that have to be killed because of bird flu, as an incentive to responsibly try and curb the spread of the disease. The USDA has spent over $1 billion in bird flu compensation for farmers since 2022, according to the nonprofit Food & Environment Reporting Network. Is There A Vaccine For The Bird Flu (H5N1)? The FDA has approved a few bird flu vaccines for humans. The U.S. has a stockpile of vaccines for H5N1 bird flu, but it wouldn’t be enough to vaccinate all Americans if an outbreak were to happen among humans. If a human outbreak does occur, the government plans to mass produce vaccines, which can take at least six months to make enough for the entire population. CSL Seqirus, the maker of one of the approved vaccines, expects to have 150 million vaccines ready within six months of an announcement of a human bird flu pandemic. Although there are approved vaccines for other variants designed for birds, there are none for the H5N1 variant circulating. However, the USDA began trials on H5N1 animal-specific vaccines in 2023. Key Background As of May 30, more than 92 million poultry (primarily chickens) in 48 states have been euthanized because of bird flu since 2022, and 57 dairy cow herds across nine states have tested positive, according to data from the CDC (unlike chickens, cows appear to recover from the virus). The USDA believes wild migratory birds are the original source of the cow outbreaks that recently has experts concerned it may mutate and spread more easily in humans, though the CDC said its risk to the public remains low. Farrar called the cattle infections in the U.S. a “huge concern,” urging public health officials to continue closely monitoring the situation “because it may evolve into transmitting in different ways.” The increased number of mammal bird flu infections since 2022 “could indicate that the virus is looking for new hosts, and of course, moving closer to people,” Andrea Garcia, vice president of science, medicine and public health for the American Medical Association, said. The first report of a walrus dying from bird flu was detected in April on one of Norway’s Arctic Islands, and the first U.S. dolphin infected with bird flu died back in 2022, according to a report published April 18. More than 10 human bird flu cases were reported to the World Health Organization in 2023, and all but one survived. Bird flu has devastated bird populations, and 67 countries reported the deaths of 131 million poultry in 2022 alone. Although bird flu typically infects wild birds and poultry, it’s spread to other animals during the outbreak, and at least 10 countries have reported outbreaks in mammals since 2022. Around 17,400 elephant seal pups died from bird flu in Argentina in 2023, and at least 24,000 sea lions died in South America the same year. Besides cattle, bird flu has been detected in over 200 other mammals—like seals, raccoons and bears—in the U.S. since 2022. Although rare, even domestic pets like dogs and cats are susceptible to the virus, and the FDA warns against giving unpasteurized milk to cats to avoid possible transmission. Tangent On June 5, WHO confirmed the first human death of a strain of bird flu that’s never before been seen in humans and is separate from H5N1. A 59-year-old man in Mexico contracted H5N2, and died on April 24 after being hospitalized and developing a fever, diarrhea, nausea, shortness of breath and general discomfort. Cases of H5N2 have been reported in poultry in Mexico, but the man had no history with poultry or animals, WHO said. It’s unclear how he became infected. He was bedridden for weeks prior to the infection, and suffered from several other health conditions.

July 19The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed an additional two bird flu cases in poultry farm workers from the same facility in Colorado, bringing the country’ total human case count to 11.

July 15Officials confirmed a fourth bird flu case in a poultry farm worker on the same Colorado farm from last week, and a fifth suspected case is pending confirmation from the CDC. This brings the national number to nine since the first human cases was detected in the state in 2022, with eight of the cases reported this year.

Once chickens have been infected with bird flu, farmers quickly kill them to help control the spread of the virus, since bird flu is highly contagious and fatal in poultry. The USDA pays farmers for all birds and eggs that have to be killed because of bird flu, as an incentive to responsibly try and curb the spread of the disease. The USDA has spent over $1 billion in bird flu compensation for farmers since 2022, according to the nonprofit Food & Environment Reporting Network.

Is There A Vaccine For The Bird Flu (h5n1)?

The FDA has approved a few bird flu vaccines for humans. The U.S. has a stockpile of vaccines for H5N1 bird flu, but it wouldn’ be enough to vaccinate all Americans if an outbreak were to happen among humans. If a human outbreak does occur, the government plans to mass produce vaccines, which can take at least six months to make enough for the entire population. CSL Seqirus, the maker of one of the approved vaccines, expects to have 150 million vaccines ready within six months of an announcement of a human bird flu pandemic. Although there are approved vaccines for other variants designed for birds, there are none for the H5N1 variant circulating. However, the USDA began trials on H5N1 animal-specific vaccines in 2023.

Key Background

As of May 30, more than 92 million poultry (primarily chickens) in 48 states have been euthanized because of bird flu since 2022, and 57 dairy cow herds across nine states have tested positive, according to data from the CDC (unlike chickens, cows appear to recover from the virus). The USDA believes wild migratory birds are the original source of the cow outbreaks that recently has experts concerned it may mutate and spread more easily in humans, though the CDC said its risk to the public remains low. Farrar called the cattle infections in the U.S. a “uge concern,”rging public health officials to continue closely monitoring the situation “ecause it may evolve into transmitting in different ways.”he increased number of mammal bird flu infections since 2022 “ould indicate that the virus is looking for new hosts, and of course, moving closer to people,”ndrea Garcia, vice president of science, medicine and public health for the American Medical Association, said. The first report of a walrus dying from bird flu was detected in April on one of Norway’ Arctic Islands, and the first U.S. dolphin infected with bird flu died back in 2022, according to a report published April 18. More than 10 human bird flu cases were reported to the World Health Organization in 2023, and all but one survived. Bird flu has devastated bird populations, and 67 countries reported the deaths of 131 million poultry in 2022 alone. Although bird flu typically infects wild birds and poultry, it’ spread to other animals during the outbreak, and at least 10 countries have reported outbreaks in mammals since 2022. Around 17,400 elephant seal pups died from bird flu in Argentina in 2023, and at least 24,000 sea lions died in South America the same year. Besides cattle, bird flu has been detected in over 200 other mammals—ike seals, raccoons and bears—n the U.S. since 2022. Although rare, even domestic pets like dogs and cats are susceptible to the virus, and the FDA warns against giving unpasteurized milk to cats to avoid possible transmission.

Tangent

On June 5, WHO confirmed the first human death of a strain of bird flu that’ never before been seen in humans and is separate from H5N1. A 59-year-old man in Mexico contracted H5N2, and died on April 24 after being hospitalized and developing a fever, diarrhea, nausea, shortness of breath and general discomfort. Cases of H5N2 have been reported in poultry in Mexico, but the man had no history with poultry or animals, WHO said. It’ unclear how he became infected. He was bedridden for weeks prior to the infection, and suffered from several other health conditions.

"Bird Flu ( H5N1 ) Explained: Colorado Facilities Detect First Human Cluster Of Bird Flu Cases, CDC Says",1693267200000,"Topline

Here’ the latest news about a global outbreak of H5N1 bird flu that started in 2020, and recently spread among cattle in U.S. states and marine mammals across the world, which health officials are closely monitoring and experts are concerned the virus could mutate and eventually spread to humans, where it has proven rare but deadly.

Timeline

August 29The July bird flu outbreaks in two Colorado poultry facilities were the country’ first known human cluster of cases caused by poultry—nfections were just one-off in the past—hough there was no reported human-to-human transmission, according to a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

July 25Three more human infections were confirmed in workers from a second Colorado poultry facility, bringing the country’ total case count to 14 since 2022, according to CDC data.

July 24A new Nature study found bird flu spread among cows in the U.S., and the animals also spread the virus to cats and raccoons; this is one of the first studies confirming mammal-to-mammal bird flu transmission.

July 19The CDC confirmed an additional two bird flu cases in poultry farm workers from the same facility in Colorado, bringing the country’ total human case count to 11.

July 15Officials confirmed a fourth bird flu case in a poultry farm worker on the same Colorado farm from last week, and a fifth suspected case is pending confirmation from the CDC. This brings the national number to nine since the first human cases was detected in the state in 2022, with eight of the cases reported this year.

July 12Colorado authorities announced three workers in a commercial egg operation have presumptive positive cases of bird flu, bringing the state’ count of known human infections up to as high as five—nd the national number to seven—hough authorities said none of the workers have been hospitalized, and showed “ommon respiratory infection symptoms”nd pink eye. It’ the first time multiple cases have been recorded at the same location.

July 3Colorado health officials confirmed the state’ second human case of bird flu in a dairy farm worker who has since recovered and only had mild symptoms, reporting pink eye.

June 25Finland said it plans to begin vaccinating vulnerable populations like farm workers against bird flu as early as next week using 10,000 vaccine series—ach with two doses—cquired as part of a European Union deal with vaccine maker CSL Seqirus to provide up to 40 million vaccines to 15 countries.

June 11The World Health Organizationannounced a four-year-old child in India was infected with H9N2 bird flu— different flu strain from H5N1—ut recovered after suffering from seizures, respiratory distress, fever and abdominal cramps; H9N2 has infected around 100 people globally since 1998, and this is the second human case in India.

June 6Dozens of cows infected with bird flu have either died or been slaughtered in Colorado, Ohio, Michigan, South Carolina and Texas, which is unusual since—nlike poultry—ows cost more to slaughter and around 90% usually make a full recovery, Reuters reported.

June 5A new study examining the 2023 bird flu outbreak in South America that killed around 17,400 elephant seal pups and 24,000 sea lions found the disease spread between the animals in several countries, the first known case of transnational virus mammal-to-mammal bird flu transmission.

May 30Another human case of bird flu has been detected in a dairy farm worker in Michigan—hough the cases aren’ connected—nd this is the first person in the U.S. to report respiratory symptoms connected to bird flu, though their symptoms are “esolving,”according to the CDC.

May 23A new study with mice suggests that drinking infected milk can spread the disease—nd that a certain type of pasteurization may not always be effective in killing the virus.

May 22Michigan reported bird flu in a farmworker—he second U.S. human case tied to transmission from dairy cows—hough the worker had a mild infection and has since recovered.

May 21Australia reported its first human case of bird flu after a child became infected in March after traveling to India, though the child has since recovered after suffering from a “evere infection,”according to the Victorian Department of Health.

May 16The USDA conducted a study, and discovered that after high levels of the virus was injected into beef, no trace was left after the meat was cooked medium to well done, though the virus was found in meat cooked to lower temperatures.

May 14The CDC released influenza A waste water data for the weeks ending in April 27 and May 4, and found several states like Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois and Kansas had unusually high levels, though the agency isn’ sure if the virus came from humans or animals, and isn’ able to differentiate between influenza A subtypes, meaning the H5N1 virus or other subtypes may have been detected.

May 10The Food and Drug Administration announced it will commit an additional $8 million to ensure the commercial milk supply is safe, while the Department of Agriculture said it will pay up to $28,000 per farm to help mitigate the spread of the disease, totaling around $98 million in funds.

May 9Some 70 people in Colorado are being monitored for bird flu due to potential exposure, and will be tested for the virus if they show any symptoms, the Colorado Department of Public Health told Forbes—t was not immediately clear how or when the people were potentially exposed.

May 1The Department of Agriculture said it tested 30 grocery store ground beef products for bird flu and they all came back negative, reaffirming the meat supply is safe.

May 1The Food and Drug Administration confirmed dairy products are still safe to consume, announcing it tested grocery store samples of products like infant formula, toddler milk, sour cream and cottage cheese, and no live traces of the bird flu virus were found, although some dead remnants were found in some of the food—hough none in the baby products.

April 30Wenqing Zhang, head of WHO's Global Influenza Programme, said during a news briefing ""there is a risk for cows in other countries to be getting infected,"" with the bird flu virus, since it’ commonly spread through the movement of migratory birds.

April 29The Department of Agriculture told Forbes it will begin testing ground beef samples from grocery stores in states with cow outbreaks, and test ground beef cooked at different temperatures and infected with the virus to determine if it's safe to eat.

April 24The USDAsaid cow-to-cow transmission may be occurring due to the cows coming into contact with raw milk—nd warned against humans and other animals, including pets, consuming unpasteurized milk to prevent potential infection.

April 18Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist for the World Health Organization, said during a press conference the threat of bird flu spreading between humans was a “reat concern,”ince it’ evolved and has increasingly been infecting mammals (on land and sea), which means it could possibly spread to humans.

April 1The CDC reported the second U.S. human case of bird flu in a Texas dairy farmer who became infected after contracting the virus from infected dairy cows, but said the person was already recovering.

Can Bird Flu Spread Between Humans?

Bird flu doesn’ “ransmit easily from person-to-person,”according to the World Health Organization. Bird flu rarely affects humans, and most previous cases came from close contact with infected poultry, according to the CDC. Because human-to-human spread of bird flu poses “andemic potential,”ach human case is investigated to rule out this type of infection. Though none have been confirmed, there are a few global cases—one in the U.S.—here human-to-human transmission of bird flu was thought to be “robable,”ncluding in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Pakistan.

Is Bird Flu Fatal To Humans?

It is very deadly. Between January 2003 and March 28, 2024 there have been 888 human cases of bird flu infection in humans, according to a report by the World Health Organization. Of those 888 cases, 463 (52%) died. To date, only two people in the U.S. have contracted H5N1 bird flu, and they both were infected after coming into contact with sick animals. The most recent case was a dairy worker in Texas who became ill in March after interacting with sick dairy cows, though he only experienced pink eye. The first incident happened in 2022 when a person in Colorado contracted the disease from infected poultry, and fully recovered.

Is It Safe To Drink Milk Infected With Bird Flu?

Raw, unpasteurized milk is unsafe to drink, but pasteurized milk is fine, according to the FDA. Bird flu has been detected in both unpasteurized and pasteurized milk, but the FDA recommends manufacturers against making and selling unpasteurized milk since there’ a possibility consuming it may cause bird flu infection. However, the virus remnants in pasteurized milk have been deactivated by the heat during the pasteurization process, so this type of milk is still believed safe to consume.

Is It Safe To Consume Meat Infected With Bird Flu?

The CDC warns against eating raw meat or eggs from animals “onfirmed or suspected”f having bird flu because of the possibility of transmission. However, no human has ever been infected with bird flu from eating properly prepared and cooked meat, according to the agency. The possibility of infected meat entering the food supply is “xtremely low”ue to rigorous inspection, so properly handled and cooked meat is safe to eat, according to the USDA. To know when meat is properly cooked, whole beef cuts must be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit, ground meat must be 160 degrees and poultry must be cooked to 165 degrees. Rare and medium rare steaks fall below this temperature. Properly cooked eggs with an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit kills bacteria and viruses including bird flu, according to the CDC. “t doesn’ matter if they may or may not have [avian] influenza…unny eggs and rare pieces of meat”re never recommended, Francisco Diez-Gonzalez, director and professor for the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, told Forbes. To “lay it safe,”onsumers should only eat fully cooked eggs and make sure “he yolks are firm with no runny parts,”aisy May, veterinary surgeon with U.K.-based company Medivet, said.

What Are Bird Flu Symptoms In Humans?

Symptoms of bird flu include a fever, cough, headache, chills, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, runny nose, congestion, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, pink eye, muscle aches and headache. However, the CDC advises it can’ be diagnosed based on symptoms alone, and laboratory testing is needed. This typically includes swabbing the nose or throat (the upper respiratory tract), or the lower respiratory tract for critically ill patients.

How Is Bird Flu Affecting Egg Prices?

This year’ egg prices have increased as production decreased due to bird flu outbreaks among poultry, according to the USDA. A dozen large, grade A eggs in the U.S. costed around $2.99 in March, up almost a dollar from the fall. However, this price is down from a record $4.82 in January 2023, which was also spiked by bird flu outbreaks. Earlier this month, Cal-Maine Foods—he country’ largest egg producer—emporarily halted egg production after over one million egg-laying hens and chickens were killed after being infected with bird flu.

Why Do Poultry Farmers Kill Chickens With Bird Flu?

Once chickens have been infected with bird flu, farmers quickly kill them to help control the spread of the virus, since bird flu is highly contagious and fatal in poultry. The USDA pays farmers for all birds and eggs that have to be killed because of bird flu, as an incentive to responsibly try and curb the spread of the disease.

Ex-CDC Director Makes Alarming Bird Flu Prediction,1718582400000,"Former CDC Director Robert Redfield suggested that a bird flu pandemic among humans is inevitable ― and would be extremely lethal. (Watch the video below.)
Redfield, who headed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2018 to 2021 after being appointed by the Trump administration, gave an alarming interview to NewsNation on Friday after the World Health Organization announced the bird-flu-related death of a 59-year-old man in Mexico.
“I really do think it’s very likely that we will, at some time ― it’s not a question of if, it’s more of a question of when ― we will have a bird flu pandemic,” Redfield said.
A wide variety of mammals have been found harboring the virus — including cows, cats, ferrets and elephant seals. The odds are increasing of a scourge between humans that could kill 25 to 50 percent of those it infects, Redfield warned.
The overall case-fatality rate for COVID-19 before vaccines were available was 1.7%, according to CDC stats. 
Redfield said scientists have found that the bird flu virus hasn’t yet adapted to spread from humans to humans, but that once it does, “that’s when you’re going to have the pandemic,” The Hill reported. “And as I said, I think it’s just a matter of time.”
Another expert expressed similar concern. “Are we watching the beginning? Is this where we’re seeing repeated spillovers that one day take off? Or is it like in COVID, where suddenly there’s a cluster of human cases and then it’s too late?” Louise Moncla, an avian flu researcher and assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told the CBC.
The World Health Organization reported earlier this month that the 59-year-old man in Mexico, who had comorbidities and died from the virus in late April, had no known contact with poultry or other animals.
The strain he had, called H5N2, had never been found in humans before, The Associated Press reported.

The bird flu strain currently affecting dairy cattle, H5N1, has reportedly given three U.S. farmworkers mild symptoms. Since its discovery in 1996, however, H5N1 has infected some 900 people around the world, with a mortality rate of about 50 percent.
“The risk here of something going from one or two sporadic cases to becoming something of international concern, it’s not insignificant,” CDC Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah told Politico in May. “We’ve all seen how a virus can spread around the globe before public health has even had a chance to get its shoes on. That’s a risk and one that we have to be mindful of.”

FDA Report Finds Traces Of Bird Flu Were In Commercial Milk Supply Samples,1714003200000,"A new report from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found traces of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercially sold pasteurized milk from several states.
According to the report, which was published on Thursday, 1 in 5 samples of commercially sold pasteurized milk contained viral fragments of H5N1, a virus known as “bird flu,” that researchers say typically infects birds, poultry and other animal species. The fragments in the milk were not live or infectious, NBC News reported.
The report found that a large number of the milk samples containing traces of bird flu came from areas that had cows infected by the virus.
But the agency said that commercial milk is still safe because of the pasteurization process, which kills bacteria, and because of the destruction of milk from cows infected by the virus, which are two federal and state measures taken to ensure milk safety for consumers.
“Even if [the] virus is detected in raw milk, pasteurization is generally expected to eliminate pathogens to a level that does not pose a risk to consumer health,” the FDA said.
The H5N1 bird flu is not a new virus. According to the World Health Organization, the virus was first found in humans in 1997 in Hong Kong. But researchers say that the virus has primarily infected birds on poultry farms.
Since 2022, more than 58 million domestic birds like chickens, ducks and turkeys in the United States have died from H5N1.
Scientists have also found that other mammals have been infected by the virus. In October 2022, a mink fur farm in Spain had an outbreak of the virus, indicating to researchers the potential for mammal to mammal transmission, as well as transmission to humans. 
From 2003 to 2016, more than 800 people were infected with H5N1, with the mortality rate at more than 50%, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. There have been five confirmed human cases worldwide and one death since October 2021, BBC reported.

Experts worry about the possibility of an H5N1 pandemic among humans, warning that the lack of clear and timely updates on the outbreak by some federal agencies, including failures to provide updates on the spread of H5N1 in cows and the safety of milk supplies, is reflective of the miscommunication steps at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Washington Post reported.
“This requires multiple agencies to coordinate and communicate internally, but most importantly externally, which doesn’t seem to be happening due to different cultures, priorities, legal responsibilities, scientific expertise, and agility,” epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina, who has closely tracked the avian flu outbreak, told the Post. “Mix that in with the usual challenges of scientific uncertainty, complexity and, quite frankly global pressure, and you got yourself an utterly, unacceptable mess.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FDA and state partners, are investigating the spread of the avian virus among dairy cows in several states across the country.
The FDA will continue testing milk supplies to further determine potential risks for consumers, and additional information will be released in the future.
“To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe. Results from multiple studies will be made available in the next few days to weeks,” the FDA said.",HuffPost,yes,no,The article reports a human mortality rate of more than 50% for H5N1 from 2003 to 2016.
