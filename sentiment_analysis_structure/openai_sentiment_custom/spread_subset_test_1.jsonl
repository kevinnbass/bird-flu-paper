{"id": "5", "title": "Avian Influenza in China Adds to Economic Concerns Amid Coronavirus Spread; China pledges more support for its economy, exempts from punitive tariffs products", "date": "2020-02-01", "fulltext": "HONG KONG�hinese authorities announced Saturday a recurrence of avian influenza in chickens in central China, adding fresh economic concerns for a country reeling from an outbreak of coronavirus that has sickened nearly 12,000 people since it emerged in December. In a sign of the pressure already on China, Australia and Vietnam joined the U.S. and others in distancing their citizens from the country over the coronavirus, while Apple Inc. shut its stores on the Chinese mainland and Beijing pledged more support for embattled businesses. The Latest on the Coronavirus * Australia orders its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days * Vietnam halts all flights to and from Taiwan and China * Apple closes all of its retail stores in mainland China until Feb. 9 * Beijing pledges more support for its economy * Avian influenza adds to concerns about economy The avian influenza is likely to add to the economic damage rather than pose a major immediate health risk. China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that a case of H5N1 avian influenza, last identified in China in April last year, had killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. But while avian influenza can be fatal in humans, with a mortality rate of 60%, according to the World Health Organization, it doesn't spread easily to humans. In addition to the coronavirus, China has been grappling with an outbreak of African swine fever that has decimated the country's pig population over the past two years. Pork is China's main source of protein, and swine fever last year pushed overall consumer inflation to the highest level in eight years. Hunan province, where the avian influenza outbreak announced on Saturday took place, neighbors Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Australia said that it would impose new entry restrictions in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, banning foreign nationals who have been in mainland China in the past 14 days from entering Australia, while Qantas Airways Ltd., the country's national carrier, said it would suspend flights to the mainland starting Feb. 9. Vietnam's civil aviation authority said it would halt all flights to and from Taiwan and China, including the special Chinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong, starting Saturday. Several countries and airlines have suspended flights to China, including Pakistan, Italy and the U.S.'s American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. The move by Australia, which also ordered its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days, to tighten entry restrictions followed a U.S. tightening. A day earlier, the U.S. said it would deny entry to foreign nationals who had traveled anywhere in China within the past 14 days and imposed quarantines on Americans returning from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. The coronavirus has killed 259 people and infected nearly 12,000 in China as of late Friday, according to the official National Health Commission in Beijing. The number of infected patients in China alone now exceeds the global total for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed nearly 800 people after emerging from southern China in 2002 and 2003. Authorities in Beijing pledged more support for the economy in a bid to reassure investors before markets reopen on Monday. Companies and industries in regions hit particularly hard by the outbreak, including those that provide medical supplies, could get reduced lending rates, the central bank said in a joint statement with other government agencies, including the Finance Ministry and the banking regulator. China's cabinet said separately that products imported from the U.S. to control the outbreak will be exempt from punitive tariffs through March 31. Authorities also exempted tariffs and other taxes on products donated by overseas entities, according to a joint statement by the Finance Ministry and the customs agency. Resources are strained in Hubei province, and medical staff have been forced to turn away patients because of a lack of beds and basic medical supplies. Local authorities in Huanggang, a city about 35 miles east of Wuhan, imposed new restrictions on residents' movements, saying only one person per household in the city center would be allowed to go out every two days to purchase basic necessities. Apple is closing all of its retail stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb. 9 \"out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts,\" it said. The company operates more than 40 stores in China. North Korea said through its state media that it would send an aid fund to Chinese authorities, a rare extension of aid from Pyongyang. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, \"expressed deep consolation for the families who lost their blood relatives due to the infectious disease,\" according to a report in Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency. North Korea� close ally of China that has long been dependent on China's largess�as among the first countries to adopt stringent measures to keep the coronavirus outside its borders, and vowed to redouble its efforts. \"The novel coronavirus throws the world into uneasiness and horror, but the advantages and might of our state system�ill be fully demonstrated to the whole world once again, when we ensure that the virus does not reach our country and that no one suffers from the infections,\" it read.

{"id": "7", "title": "Avian Flu Fast Facts", "date": "2024-06-05", "fulltext": "(CNN) � Here's a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds. There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called \"Influenza A (H5N1),\" or the \"H5N1 virus.\" Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu. The mortality rate is close to 60% for infected humans. Timeline Early 1900s -The avian flu is first identified in Italy. 1961 - The H5N1 strain is isolated in birds in South Africa. December 1983 - Chickens in Pennsylvania and Virginia are exposed to the avian flu and more than five million birds are killed to stop the disease from spreading. 1997 - Eighteen people are infected by the H5N1 strain in Hong Kong, six die.

Nagy Awad, head of the veterinary agency in the southwestern province of al-Wadi al-Gedid, said Sunday that avian influenza was detected in two poultry farms in the villages of Ezab el-Qasr and Oweina in the Dakhla Oasis, located over 750 kilometers (470 miles) from the capital, Cairo. He said the infected birds were culled and authorities have carried out medical examinations of people who were in contact with them. The virus, which is mainly spread through contact with infected animals, can cause severe illness or death in humans. Egypt suffered a major outbreak of bird flu in 2006 that led to the suspension of all poultry exports. Authorities have been pressing to renew them, and earlier this year, the World Organization for Animal Health, an intergovernmental body, had declared Egypt free of bird flu for the first time in 14 years. The H5N1 strain of bird flu spread in early 2000s in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, leading to the slaughter of tens of millions of chickens and ducks. Hundreds of people were infected, many of whom died, according to the World Health Organization. Egypt is at high risk because many of its poultry farms are in residential areas. Many Egyptians also raise pigeons and chickens at home to supplement their income. Even in dense urban areas, birds are kept on rooftops, balconies and courtyards.

{"id": "20", "title": "A New Bird Flu Jumps to Humans. So Far, It� Not a Problem.", "date": "2021-04-21", "fulltext": "Covid fuels the current virus pandemic, but the world is full of flu viruses waiting in the wings. And they keep changing unpredictably. When a bird flu virus struck a major poultry farm in Russia earlier this year, it was a reminder that the coronavirus causing the pandemic was not the only dangerous virus out there. The authorities quickly tested the birds and moved into high gear, killing 800,000 chickens, disposing of the carcasses and cleaning the farm to stop the potential spread to other chicken farms. But they were also concerned for humans. They tested the birds and sequenced the virus, determining that it was the H5N8 strain of avian flu, highly dangerous to both wild and domestic birds. It is established in Asia and has been increasingly causing deadly outbreaks in birds in Europe. H5N8 viruses have infected some poultry flocks in the United States, but the viruses come from a different though related lineage of virus, distinct from the current H5N8 viruses in Asia and Europe. Flu viruses combine and mutate frequently in unpredictable ways. In the short period from Dec. 25, 2020, to Jan. 14 of this year, more than seven million birds were lost to H5N8 outbreaks in Europe and Asia. Europe alone had 135 outbreaks among poultry and 35 among wild birds. Of course, to put the numbers in context, humans consume about 65 billion chickens each year, and one estimate puts the number of chickens on the globe at any one time at 23 billion. As damaging as H5N8 has been to birds, it had never infected people. Until February. The Russian health authorities also tested about 200 of the people involved in the cleanup of the farm in Astrakhan, using nasal swabs and later blood tests for antibodies. They reported that for the first time, H5N8 had jumped to people. Seven of the workers appeared to have been infected with the virus, although none of them became ill. Only one of those seven cases, however, was confirmed by genetically sequencing the virus. Nonetheless, the potential danger of the new virus and its jump to humans set off alarm bells for Dr. Daniel R. Lucey, a physician and a specialist in pandemics at Georgetown University. He began writing about the Astrakhan event in a blog for other infectious disease experts as soon as it was publicized. He reported that during a television interview, a Russian public health official said the H5N8 virus was likely to evolve into human-to-human transmission. That possibility was frightening. �The W.H.O. finally put out a report Feb. 26,�e said. But it did not frame the event as particularly alarming because the virus was not causing human disease, and the report judged the risk of human-to-human transmission as low, despite the Russian official� comment. To Dr. Lucey, no one else seemed to be taking the infection of humans with H5N8 as �f any concern.�e added, � think it� of concern.� Other scientists said they were not as worried. Dr. Florian Krammer, a flu researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, said he was more concerned about other avian flu viruses like H5N1 that have already shown themselves to be dangerous to people. Another avian influenza virus, H7N9, infected people for the first time in 2013. There have been more than 1,500 confirmed cases and more than 600 deaths since then. Since 2017 there have been only three confirmed cases and the virus does not jump easily from person to person. It is always possible that any virus can evolve human-to-human transmission, as well as become more dangerous. But H5N8 would have both hurdles to jump. Compared to other viral threats, Dr. Krammer said, �� not worried.� Dr. Richard J. Webby, a flu specialist at the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and director of the W.H.O.� Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that all of the H5 viruses are of concern because some of them have infected and killed people. But, he said, �hey all have the same sort of binding capacity to human cells, which is limited,�e said. Flu viruses use a slightly different way to attach to cells in birds than to cells in humans and being good at one usually means not being good at the other. Dr. Webby also said that while seven infections would certainly be of concern, only one infection has been confirmed. The tests of the other six involved nasal swabs and blood antibody tests. In people with no symptoms, he said, nasal swabs can simply indicate that they had breathed in virus. That would not mean it had infected them. Blood antibody tests also have a potential for error, he said, and may not be able to distinguish exposure to one flu virus from another. Nor did he see any scientific basis for suggesting that H5N8 is more likely than any other bird flu to evolve human-to-human transmission. But any virus could evolve that ability. Dr. Lucey said that he was heartened to see that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had prepared a candidate vaccine for H5N8 before it had infected humans. Candidate vaccines are simply first steps in planning for potential problems, and have not been through any testing. They exist for many viruses. �umans should be routinely tested for the virus, right at the time of the outbreak in birds,�r. Lucey said. He favors the protocol followed in Astrakhan, and argues that for any outbreak among birds, public health authorities should test people who are exposed to sick birds with nasopharyngeal swabs and an antibody test, followed by other antibody tests a few weeks later. An upcoming editorial in the journal Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease also takes up the Astrakhan incident and calls for increased monitoring of all H5 viruses.

The risk of widespread transmission is low, Chinese officials said, and there are no other human cases of H10N3 reported elsewhere in the world. Avian influenza Type A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds and have been found in more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While these viruses don� normally infect humans, birds can shed virus in their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC says. Human infections can occur if enough virus gets into a person� eyes, nose, or mouth. The CDC says two strains of bird flu viruses have been mostly responsible for human infection and mortality: H7N9 and H5N1. Symptoms of avian influenza A virus infections can range from mild to severe and include conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness such as fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches. Symptoms can also be accompanied by nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and severe respiratory illness, according to the CDC.

China Reports First Human Case of H10N3 Strain", "date": "2021-06-04", "fulltext": "Chinese health authorities said a 41-year-old man had contracted a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3 and had been in the hospital since late April, calling it the first reported human case globally from the strain. The National Health Commission said the man developed a fever and other symptoms on April 23 and was admitted to hospital in Jiangsu province five days later. On Tuesday the health commission said his condition was stable and indicated he was ready to be discharged. How did the man become infected? The health commission didn't give details on how the man came into contact with the virus. Cases of bird flu in humans have most commonly been reported among those in close daily contact with poultry, such as chicken farmers. The commission advised the public to avoid contact with sick and dead poultry. Can bird flu kill people? Avian influenza can be fatal in humans. Highly pathogenic strains, such as H5N1, can have a mortality rate of about 60%, according to the World Health Organization. However, the WHO says, bird flu doesn't spread easily from birds to people. How common are bird-flu outbreaks in China? China has seen several outbreaks of bird flu, including one at the height of the coronavirus outbreak last year, when H5N1 avian influenza killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. In May, China's Agriculture Ministry said the H5N8 strain of bird flu killed hundreds of wild birds in Tibet, prompting authorities to disinfect areas including a national wetland park. Are authorities worried? China said the risk of a large-scale outbreak was extremely low. It said local health authorities' contact-tracing and monitoring efforts had found no other cases and no human-to-human transmission. It said the H10N3 strain doesn't have the ability to effectively infect humans. What do experts say? Human infections with bird-flu viruses are rare but not uncommon, said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, a professor at the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \"It is highly likely that this infection just represents one of the rare incidents of human infection with an avian influenza virus, without any more consequences,\" said Prof. Garcia-Sastre. \"Nevertheless, it's important to make sure that this is just that, a rare isolated incident.\" The fact that the case happened in April and there hasn't been any other reports of cases suggests there hasn't been a cluster of infections, says Peng Shifang, a professor of infectious diseases at Central South University in China's Hunan province. Is China upfront about the recent bird-flu case? China said it had determined on May 28 through genome sequencing that the man suffered from the H10N3 strain. It issued its statement on the results on Tuesday. While China has been criticized for a lack of transparency in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, its public-health apparatus is generally seen as having become more transparent since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, when official secrecy hampered the response.

A man has been hospitalized in southwestern China after contracting the H5N6 strain of avian flu, Chinese state news media reported on Thursday, a reminder that the world is full of flu viruses even during a coronavirus pandemic. The man, 55, was hospitalized in Bazhong, a city in the southwestern province of Sichuan, after coming down with a fever and testing positive for the virus on July 6, the state-run China Global Television Network reported. Local officials had �ctivated an emergency response and sterilized the area,�he broadcaster said in a brief report in English.

{"id": "33", "title": "What is bird flu and why is it back in the news?", "date": "2021-12-09", "fulltext": "With the UK hit by a record outbreak, here� a quick guide to the viral disease also known as avian influenza What is avian flu? Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a contagious viral disease in animals, caused by a virus loosely related to human influenza. Some strains of the disease have been passed to humans but this is very rare, and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals. While all bird species and, less commonly, pigs are thought to be susceptible, domestic poultry flocks are especially vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks can rapidly result in epidemics among bird populations. Public health authorities are concerned about the potential of the virus to mutate into subtypes capable of causing human disease. As a result they warn there is always a threat of a new influenza pandemic emerging. Why is it in the news again? The UK has been hit by a record outbreak that has resulted in 500,000 captive birds being culled this autumn. An avian influenza prevention zone was declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. What are the most dangerous strains? The NHS says there are four strains that have caused particular concern in recent years. The first, identified in 1997, was H5N1, followed by H7N9 in 2013, H5N6 the following year and H5N8 in 2016. The H5N1 form has been the cause of most concern in recent years and the UK government has said particular safety measures were put in place in parts of North Yorkshire on 21 November after confirmed and suspected cases of that strain in poultry in the area. Where has it appeared? The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, has said there are 40 infected premises in the UK. They include 38 in Great Britain �f which 33 are in England �nd two in Northern Ireland. By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland� Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on the Trotternish peninsula, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Some 22,100 ducks were culled at a commercial premises in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, while culling and an exclusion zone was also being applied to a second site in Broughshane, Co Antrim, described as a �mall backyard flock� If it just affects birds, why the panic? It doesn�. World Health Organization (WHO) figures show that from 2003 to 2021 there were 863 confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus in humans. Of these cases, 456 people died. While transmission is rare, it has happened. So far, most of the human deaths have been in countries in Asia, in communities in which people live in close proximity to poultry. Although it does not easily infect humans, every time it does it increases the chance that the virus could mutate into a form that could be passed from one infected human to another. The WHO fears this could lead to a flu pandemic. How do you catch bird flu? It is very unlikely you will catch the virus unless you have been in close contact with infected birds or someone with confirmed or suspected bird flu. The virus is found in secretions from the eyes and respiratory tract, and droppings of infected birds. Humans can catch the virus by inhaling droplets sneezed by infected birds or the dust from their bedding or droppings. What are the symptoms in humans? They vary depending on the strain. Most infections have flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and aches and pains. Symptoms of the H5N1 subtype are more severe and frequently result in death. Other symptoms can include conjunctivitis �ed, sore and discharging eyes. How does it spread? WHO scientists have said they believe it is likely the virus is carried by migrating birds. More recently the UK government has said it �preads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces� Officials added: �t can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear �vian influenza isn� an airborne virus.� It can spread to humans who touch infected birds, droppings or bedding or who kill or prepare infected poultry for cooking, the NHS has said. People cannot catch bird flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas affected by an outbreak, health officials have said. What measures is the UK taking? The government has said the chief veterinary officers for each of the UK� constituent nations have �greed to bring in new housing measures to protect poultry and captive birds from avian influenza following a number of confirmed cases across Great Britain in recent weeks� It added: �he new housing measures, which will come into force on Monday 29 November, mean that it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.� How do you spot the virus in birds? Symptoms in infected birds include a swollen head and blue discoloration around the neck and throat. They will also show signs of breathing problems including gaping beaks, coughing, sneezing and rattling wheezing. Poultry farmers will also notice a loss of appetite in the infected birds and a decrease in egg laying. People are advised not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds they find. In Great Britain, dead wild waterfowl or other wild birds should be reported to Defra. Some will then be collected and tested to help scientists understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird. What drug treatments are available to humans? There is no vaccine for avian flu. If a person were infected, the NHS has said they would be either told to stay at home or put into isolation in hospital. They would then be treated with an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (known as Tamiflu) or zanamivir (known as Relenza). Scientists have found that such treatments �elp reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival. They are also sometimes given to people who have been in close contact with infected birds, or those who have had contact with infected people, for example family or healthcare staff,�he NHS said.", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that 456 out of 863 confirmed human cases resulted in death.

But it's an outbreak of the H5N1 avian flu among migratory cranes and domestic poultry that is drawing global concern. The bird flu, as its also called, is spreading fast in northern Israel, where at least 5,200 cranes have died of the disease and hundreds of thousands of chickens have been culled in an effort to contain its advance. The avian flu is confined mostly to birds. It rarely jumps to humans, but when it does it can be lethal. As of October, the World Health Organization had confirmed 863 cases of H5N1 in people, 456 of whom died, around the world since 2003. Israel has not recorded any infections in humans this year. Those who have possibly been exposed to the virus are receiving preventive antiviral treatments. Other countries, including Britain, China, Norway and South Korea, have also reported major or higher-than-unusual H5N1 outbreaks in recent months. In November, Britain declared a bird flu prevention zone, requiring all farmers to follow stricter biosecurity protocols after several outbreaks. Israel is a central stop along the route of many species of birds migrating from Europe and Asia to Africa, a convergence that raises the risk of avian flu spreading from wild birds to captive poultry populations in the country. Each year, about 500,000 cranes migrate through Israel, some 30,000 of which stayed to winter over there this year. The yearly stopover, often part of journeys lasting thousands of miles, draws the attention of bird enthusiasts, who travel to observe the large, long-legged and long-necked birds. The H5N1 outbreak has wrought \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country,\" Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg said in a tweet Sunday. She shared a photo of dead cranes peppering a lake in Israel's Hula Nature Reserve, a hot spot for migratory birds. \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" Zandberg said. Israel reported its first cases of bird flu in 2006, and has seen outbreaks nearly every year since, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The extent of this year's train of transmission is not yet clear, but regulations require poultry and wild birds be kept separated to limit the chance of transference. Word of Israel's latest outbreak began to spread on Dec. 19, when the Agriculture Ministry reported that H5N1 had been detected in a farming community, Margaliot, near Israel's northern border with Lebanon. The ministry said it had closed off the area and halted egg production. Crowded and unregulated chicken coops are a \"ticking bomb\" for developing diseases, Agriculture Minister Oded Feror said in a statement at the time. That same day, Israeli media reported that about 100 cranes had died in a bird flu outbreak in Hula Lake in a nature reserve in northern Israel. Authorities closed down the area to the public and days later temporarily shut the entire nature reserve. Israel's Nature and Parks Authority shared photos of workers in hazmat suits collecting the bodies of dead cranes from the water. In the following days, outbreaks were detected in at least three other farms in the north as the Agriculture Ministry underwent mass testing. The parks authority said Thursday that an estimated 1 in 5 cranes in Israel were likely to be infected with the virus, Israeli media reported. There have also been reports of deaths from the virus among other bird species. Israel's Agricultural Ministry has warned the public to buy only eggs with the required regulatory stamp and to consume thoroughly cooked eggs to prevent any further spread. The public has also been warned to keep a distance from wild birds. On Tuesday, the ministry told chicken farmers in Margaliot to monitor cats that spend time around the coops, as felines can also become infected with the virus.

A highly contagious and deadly form of avian influenza has been barreling across the eastern half of the United States in recent weeks, killing both wild birds and farmed poultry and raising fears that an unchecked outbreak could prove calamitous for an industry that was devastated by a similar virus seven years ago. Since early January, when it began killing chickens in northeast Canada, the virus has been identified in migratory waterfowl from Florida to Maine, and has infected backyard chickens in Virginia and New York and sickened thousands of turkeys in Kentucky and Indiana, prompting mass cullings and import bans. On Wednesday, federal officials announced that the virus, a so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza, had been found in a Delaware commercial chicken farm on the Delmarva Peninsula, home to one of the country� largest concentrations of poultry farms. Experts suspect wild birds returning from winter feeding grounds are spreading the virus, most likely through contaminated droppings. With the peak springtime migration still weeks away, many fear the worst is yet to come. �t� very concerning given how quickly this thing is accelerating,�aid Henry Niman, a biochemist in Pittsburgh who studies the genetic evolution of viruses and has been tracking the outbreak� spread across the country. � think we could see historic levels of infections.� Federal officials have been urging poultry growers to report sick or dying birds and to tighten their farms�iosecurity measures, which includes preventing contact between wild birds and domestic animals. �t� important to note that avian influenza is not considered to be a risk to public health and it� not a food-safety risk,�ike Stepien, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture� Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in an email. Although the danger to humans is low, scientists are keeping a close eye on the virus, the Eurasian H5N1, which is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry. That virus does not spread efficiently among humans, but it is extremely deadly, with a fatality rate of 60 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The strain currently spreading across the United States has not jumped to humans, but virologists and epidemiologists say the mounting infections among birds is worrisome because it increases the possibility that the virus could mutate in ways that make it more infectious to people. Dr. Gail Hansen, a public health veterinarian who is the former state epidemiologist for Kansas, noted that influenza viruses have historically been behind the pandemics that affect humans. Some medical historians have traced the deadly influenza pandemic of 1918 to Army recruits in Kansas who may have caught the pathogen from farm animals and then spread it to military camps in Europe. �cientists always assumed the next pandemic would be a respiratory influenza,�he said. �e were wrong with Covid, but it� these kinds of viruses that keep us awake at night.� The virus has also been coursing through Asia, the Middle East and Europe. In recent weeks, 300 outbreaks have been reported in 29 European countries. In Israel, an outbreak at a nature reserve killed thousands of cranes. At the moment turkey farmers, especially those in Indiana and Kentucky, are most worried. Over the past two weeks, several farms in those states have been shuttered after officials discovered the virus among birds that spend their entire lives crammed into massive sheds. Farmers say they have been stunned by how efficiently the virus kills, with animals dying hours after the initial infection. In Indiana, state officials have moved quickly, euthanizing more than 100,000 birds and throwing a six-mile cordon around affected farms � containment area within which exports are halted and birds are tested daily. �veryone is on super-high alert and trying to be as prepared as possible because we all remember the devastation of 2014 and 2015,�aid Dr. Denise Heard, a veterinarian with the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. The 2014-15 outbreak is considered the most destructive in the nation� history. It sent poultry and egg prices soaring and cost the industry more than $3 billion �hough the federal government compensated farmers for lost flocks. In the end, nearly 50 million birds were killed by the virus or destroyed to prevent its spread, a vast majority of them in Iowa and Minnesota. John Burkel, 54, a fourth-generation turkey grower in northern Minnesota, has been watching the spread with trepidation. In 2015, the virus tore through his farm in a matter of days, leaving just 70 survivors in a shed that had held 7,000 birds. The weeks that followed were spent culling, composting the dead and then repeatedly disinfecting the barns. As a precaution, health officials also advised that he and his son take a course of the antiviral drug Tamiflu. �e�e never seen a virus that virulent,�aid Mr. Burkel, a state legislator who works the farm with his wife and two children. �t was just horrible.� Since then, agriculture officials across the country have pushed farmers to embrace an array of biosecurity measures aimed at preventing outbreaks. They include sealing up tiny holes that might allow mice or sparrows to enter barns, disinfecting the tires of feed-delivery trucks before they enter a farm and creating �lean�nd �irty�ones where workers can change into fresh footwear and coveralls before stepping inside an animal containment shed. At the same time, experts say that federal officials have strengthened the nationwide system of surveillance that allows researchers to track, in almost real time, an avian flu� spread within wild bird populations. � think the crisis of 2015 made us realize it takes a village to prevent an outbreak and has left us much better prepared,�aid Dr. Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian at Iowa State University who advises local farmers about improving their biosecurity practices. But hypervigilance has its limits, especially against a microscopic pathogen that can infiltrate a barn on the leg of a single housefly. For a growing number of scientists, the real threat is the nation� industrialized system of meat and dairy production, with its reliance on genetically identical creatures packed by the thousands inside huge confinement sheds. Nearly all the nine billion chickens raised and slaughtered in the United States each year can trace their lineage to a handful of breeds that have been manipulated to favor fast growth and plump breasts. The birds are also exceptionally vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. �hey all have the same immune system, or lack of an immune system, so once a virus gets inside a barn, it� going to spread like wildfire,�aid Dr. Hansen, the public health veterinarian. Andrew deCoriolis, the executive director of Farm Forward, a sustainable agriculture advocacy group, said the lack of genetic diversity isn� just a threat to the nation� food supply; it is also a potential threat to public health. More than half the 22 strains of novel influenza virus that the C.D.C. has identified as �f special concern�o human health are avian influenza viruses, he said, noting that a 2018 study examining the emergence of 39 highly pathogenic avian viruses found that all but two of them had emerged on industrial poultry farms. He said the sector� emphasis on biosecurity and infection containment obscures a larger, thornier issue that requires a fundamental rethinking of meat and egg production in the United States. �nstead of asking how factory farms can prevent infections that originate in the environment, which is how they frame it now, we should be asking how they can prevent infections that originate on factory farms,�e said. �f we keep raising more and more animals in these conditions, we should expect the exact outcome we�e getting because that� how the system is set up.� Young turkeys at an Iowa barn in 2015, after a devastating avian influenza outbreak that year.

But her customers, like many across the country, are paying more for the bagels, knishes and pastries at her Bagel King deli in Deltona, Florida. � just raised my prices about four days ago,�ubanks said last week. � watch my profit and loss really closely, and when I see it going in the wrong direction, I raise my prices. Everybody has to pay more. It� just sad.� Egg prices more than doubled nationally in March, according to the Urner Barry Egg Index, a blend of egg values in the wholesale market. That� in part because of the drastic measures taken to try to curb the spread of the mutating bird flu virus, the worst outbreak since 2014-2015. More than 24 million domestic chickens, turkey and other domestic birds have been killed in the U.S. since February. While the risk to people is low with this outbreak, scientists have rising concerns about the increasing threats of animal-borne viruses spreading to people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends farmers, poultry workers and hunters take steps to protect themselves and contain the virus. No human cases have been documented from this strain of the avian flu in the U.S., and only one was reported in Europe, said Todd Davis, lead of the CDC� zoonotic virus team in virology surveillance. Eating poultry and eggs is safe, as long as they are fully cooked, the CDC said. BIRD FLU: Bald eagles in 14 states have died amid bird flu outbreak OUTBREAK: Zoos are sequestering birds as avian flu spreads across North America Among birds, avian flu can be deadly and spread rapidly. When it� detected in a commercial poultry flock, federal rules require the birds to be killed to try to �tamp out�he virus, said Bryan Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey� National Wildlife Health Center. One Iowa farm laid off more than 200 employees after an outbreak forced the destruction of 5.3 million laying hens. The farm deaths ignited protests among animal rights activists. A woman quickly dubbed �lue girl�as removed from an NBA game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Los Angeles Clippers on April 13 after she sprayed adhesive on the court and tried to glue herself to the floor to protest the euthanasia of birds on a farm belonging to Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor. Zoos in at least a half dozen states have shuttered aviaries to protect their birds. Backyard flock owners are keeping their chickens in and trying to keep wild waterfowl out of farm ponds to protect their birds. After the virus was reported in 41 countries during the latter half of 2021, U.S. and Canadian officials were on high alert, swabbing live birds and ducks taken by hunters to monitor for it, Richards said. This strain of the avian flu made its first appearance in North America in late November, in great black backed gulls in Newfoundland, where birds sometimes land after being blown across the Atlantic from Europe. By April 18, the virus had taken flight in the U.S. and was reported in more than 230 counties in 37 states and at least six Canadian provinces. In addition to domestic chickens, turkeys and ducks, USGS data shows at least 32 species of wild birds have been infected in the U.S., including bald eagles, snowy owls, swans and white pelicans. This virus is not related to the still unidentified pathogen that made songbirds sick last year, Richards said. Maps of the outbreak this spring showed the flu moving along the Missouri River basin, �ery clearly on the wings�n migrating waterfowl, Richards said. But the timing was fortunate because the flu began spreading just as the birds were dispersing, rather than being gathered in large winter congregations that could be �irus factories,�e said. An outbreak in Israel where 40,000 common cranes were gathered killed 8,000 of them in a matter of weeks. Scientists are monitoring avian flu and other pathogens in animals more closely than ever because of the rising threat the viruses could spread to people, or back and forth between people and animals, mutating into different strains as they go. The opportunities for new emerging pathogens to appear and spill over into people has increased in recent decades, researchers said. For example, Richards pointed to the COVID-19 virus, which was found in a host of captive and wild animals, including lions, tigers, gorillas, cats, dogs, deer and mink. �e�e created opportunities where wildlife, humans and domestic animals literally share time and space,\" he said. \"Pathogens can leverage those opportunities.� That potential has prompted calls from some scientists to strengthen reporting techniques and information sharing around the world to minimize the risk of another global pandemic. This H5 strain of the avian flu has been evolving in the world� birds since the late 1990s, mutating and swapping genes with other avian influenza, said the CDC� Davis. One version of the virus has caused 863 human infections in 18 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. Of those, 455 were fatal. The strain circulating now lacks genetic characteristics associated with human infection. While catastrophic to poultry, the CDC considers the risk low to humans. The single European case was a person with no symptoms and prolonged exposure to ducks that lived indoors, Davis said. People who may be exposed by handling wild birds or working in affected commercial operations should be aware of the potential for infection and take extra precautions. For example, hunters and individuals handling wild birds should wash their hands. People working to decontaminate poultry farms are advised to wear N95 face masks and gloves, and in some cases protective gowns. Davis said these people should also get tested if they experience any flu symptoms. �here� still things we don� know,�uch as the overall potential for exposure, he said. �o we want to be extra cautious, especially with the highly pathogenic strains.� INDIANA FARM: Bird flu found on poultry farm in Indiana, nearly 30,000 turkeys killed to contain spread Dead birds should be reported to state wildlife hotlines and bird watchers have been advised to avoid spreading mud from wetlands and swampy areas with their boots, cars and equipment. American Poultry Association members who raise birds for enjoyment and show have also worked to protect their flocks from exposure, said David Adkins, secretary/treasurer and a competition judge. Georgia state officials canceled the association� semi-annual show in February. Similar shows and fair exhibitions have been canceled in at least five states, including Iowa, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Adkins said he feels bad for youths in 4-H and Future Farmers of America chapters who haven� been able to display the poultry they�e raised. Using toy stuffed birds to demonstrate their showmanship just isn� the same, he said: �t� hard on those kids when they spent the time raising their project.� Richards and other scientists hope to see the impacts of the virus diminish as spring migration comes to a close. And they hope this outbreak doesn� match the 2014-15 season, when 50 million birds were killed.

But her customers, like many across the country, are paying more for the bagels, knishes and pastries at her Bagel King deli in Deltona, Florida. \"I just raised my prices about four days ago,\" Eubanks said last week. \"I watch my profit and loss really closely, and when I see it going in the wrong direction, I raise my prices. Everybody has to pay more. It's just sad.\" Egg prices more than doubled nationally in March, according to the Urner Barry Egg Index, a blend of egg values in the wholesale market. That's in part because of the drastic measures taken to try to curb the spread of the mutating bird flu virus, the worst outbreak since 2014-2015. More than 24 million chickens, turkey and other domestic birds have been killed in the U.S. since February. While the risk to people is low with this outbreak, scientists have rising concerns about the increasing threats of animal-borne viruses spreading to people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends farmers, poultry workers and hunters take steps to protect themselves. No human cases have been documented from this strain of the avian flu in the U.S., and only one has been reported in Europe, said Todd Davis, lead of the CDC's zoonotic virus team in virology surveillance. Eating poultry and eggs is safe, as long as they are fully cooked, the CDC said. Among birds, avian flu can be deadly and spread rapidly. When it's detected in a commercial poultry flock, federal rules require the birds to be killed to try to \"stamp out\" the virus, said Bryan Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center. One Iowa farm laid off more than 200 employees after an outbreak forced the destruction of 5.3 million laying hens. The farm deaths ignited protests among animal rights activists. A woman quickly dubbed \"glue girl\" was removed from an NBA game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Los Angeles Clippers on April 13 after she sprayed adhesive on the court and tried to glue herself to the floor to protest the euthanasia of birds on a farm belonging to Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor. Zoos in at least a half dozen states have shuttered aviaries to protect their birds. Backyard flock owners are keeping their chickens in and trying to keep wild waterfowl out of farm ponds to protect their birds. After the virus was reported in 41 countries in the last half of 2021, U.S. and Canadian officials were on high alert, swabbing live birds and ducks taken by hunters to monitor for it, Richards said. This strain of the avian flu made its first appearance in North America in late November in great black backed gulls in Newfoundland, where birds sometimes land after being blown across the Atlantic from Europe. By April 18, the virus had taken flight in the U.S. and was reported in more than 230 counties in 37 states and at least six Canadian provinces. In addition to domestic birds, USGS data shows at least 32 species of wild birds have been infected in the U.S., including bald eagles, snowy owls, swans and white pelicans.

The man who tested positive for bird flu was an inmate at a state correctional facility in Delta County who was exposed to infected birds while working at a commercial farm in Montrose County, Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment said. He reported only one symptom of fatigue and recovered after a few days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Outbreaks of avian influenza have killed wild birds including dozens of bald eagles and lead to death through sickness or culling of tens of millions of poultry raised for meat and eggs in recent months. \"It spreads very quickly in poultry, makes poultry very sick, and can be lethal,\" said Troy Sutton, an assistant professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Pennsylvania State University. The high transmissibility of this version of H5N1 among poultry and the increase in cases from late 2021 into this year had raised concerns among officials and disease experts of potential exposure to humans in the U.S., Dr. Sutton said. The risk to most people remains low, the CDC said on Thursday, but the agency advised people who work in proximity to infected birds to take extra precautions including wearing gloves, medical face masks and goggles. People in close contact with infected birds can be exposed to the virus through a bird's saliva, mucus and feces. \"When there is human infection with these viruses, often it can be severe,\" said Richard Webby, member of the department of infectious diseases at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. \"The case fatality rate is much higher with this virus than it is for a typical seasonal, human influenza infection.\" Among over 800 detected human cases of H5N1 globally from 2003 to March 2022, the case fatality rate was 53%, according to the World Health Organization. Most deaths associated with H5N1 viruses were caused by severe pneumonia and a collapse of the respiratory system, Dr. Webby said. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the risk of avian influenza spreading more widely to humans are low but not zero. \" Viruses change quite quickly, and we've seen that with Covid,\" Dr. Poulsen said. \"Flu does change, and when you get a strain that will move species to species, we need to know about it right away because it could create another infectious disease outbreak.\" Contagious Bird Flu Presents Low Risk to People After Colorado Case", "media_outlet": "WSJ", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate of 53% for H5N1 globally but does not provide nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.", "spread_risk": "yes", "spread_feedback": "The article suggests that while the current risk of bird flu spreading to humans is low, there is potential for it to change and become more infectious or spread more widely.

{"id": "148", "title": "First recent US case of human bird flu confirmed in Colorado", "date": "2022-04-29", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) � Colorado prison inmate has become the first person in the U.S. to test positive for bird flu in a recent outbreak that has led to the deaths of millions of chickens and turkeys, but federal officials say they still see little threat to the general public. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday evening that the infected man had been in a prerelease program and was helping to remove chickens from an infected farm. The man, who was under age 40, reported fatigue for a few days but has recovered, state health and CDC officials said in a statement. The man was isolated and is being treated with an antiviral drug. Other people involved in the bird removal operation in Colorado have tested negative, but they are being retested out of an abundance of caution. The man was part of a crew of inmates nearing release who had been working at the farm before a case of bird flu was confirmed there on April 19, said Lisa Wiley, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Corrections. When bird flu was detected at the farm in Montrose County, the inmates were asked to help kill and remove the birds. Agriculture officials have reported an outbreak at one Montrose County farm with 58,000 broiler breeder chickens. Despite the infection, the CDC considers the threat to the general public to be low because spread of the virus to people requires close contact with an infected bird. Signals that could raise the public health risk might include multiple reports of virus infections in people from exposure to birds, or identification of spread from one person to another. The CDC also is monitoring for genetic changes to the H5N1 bird flu virus that is currently circulating. Any genetic changes could indicate the virus is adapting to spread more readily from birds to people or other mammals. Many different bird flu viruses have infected humans worldwide since at least the 1990s, but health officials still say human infection is uncommon. In 2002, H7N2 caused pinkeye and mild respiratory symptoms in people in the U.K. and the U.S. Four U.S. infections have been identified since 2002; two were transmitted from cats to humans in 2016. More than 1,500 people in China have been infected with the H7N9 strain, largely in outbreaks between 2013 and 2017. This version caused serious infections among people and 40% of those who were hospitalized died. A different variant of H5N1 has also circulated since 1997, infecting more than 880 people, and it had a 50% case fatality rate. The current H5N1 variant has been spreading among backyard and commercial chicken and turkey flocks in the U.S. since late February. Viruses have been found in U.S. commercial and backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states. More than 35 million chickens and turkeys have been killed and removed to avoid spread, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported. The CDC said it has tracked the health of more than 2,500 people who have been exposed to H5N1-infected birds but that the inmate's illness was the only confirmed case to date. The agency said it was possible the man only had the virus present in his nose and that his body was not infected. Colorado public health officials say repeat testing on the man was negative for influenza. A nasal swab positive test result meets the agency's criteria for considering it an infection. �he appropriate public health response at this time is to assume this is an infection and take actions to contain and treat,�he CDC statement said. ___ Associated Press reporter Colleen Slevin in Denver contributed to this report.

The CDC did not reveal the neuraminidase subtype of the virus � he N portion of an influenza A virus�ame. The country is currently experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in both wild birds and in commercial poultry flocks. uthorities in Colorado are monitoring the health of about 10 people who were in contact with a man who tested positive for H5 bird flu when he was involved in culling poultry infected with the virus. The man, who is incarcerated at a state correctional facility and was taking part in a pre-release work program, is being considered the country’s first case of H5 bird flu. The people being monitored worked with him and shared transportation to the poultry operation. State Epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy said Friday that all the individuals have tested twice for the virus and all tests have been negative so far. They were all offered the flu antiviral Tamiflu, which can be used both to treat and prevent flu infections, though Herlihy wasn’t certain all had agreed to take it. They will be monitored for 10 days after their last exposure to the unidentified man, who she said had recovered from a very mild illness. “We’re being cautious,” Herlihy told STAT. “We’re using isolation, we’re using treatment, we’re monitoring contacts doing all of those things. But we continue to believe that the risk overall is low.” In reality, it’s not clear the man was infected. Workers who were culling the birds underwent daily symptom checks; on April 20, they were tested using nose swabs. On April 26, the state’s public health laboratory concluded the man had been infected with an influenza A virus, but it was unable to subtype the virus. The sample was then sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which confirmed on April 27 that the swab contained H5 virus. The subtyping of the neuraminidase the N in the virus’ name is still underway, but the presumption is that the birds and the man were infected with H5N1 viruses. The man was placed in isolation on April 26, after the state laboratory could not subtype the virus, Lisa Wiley, a public affairs officer for the Colorado Department of Corrections, said in an email. The move was taken out of an abundance of caution, she said. In interviews with public health officials after the fact, the man acknowledged feeling fatigued for a few days around the time the test was taken. But he reported none of the respiratory symptoms normally associated with flu. In a statement issued by the CDC on Thursday evening, the agency raised the possibility that the man may not have been infected the swab may have just picked up the virus in his nostrils. But the positive test means he meets the definition of a case, the CDC said. “There’s some additional work that CDC can do, but we might not ever know if this was truly an infection or not,” said Herlihy. For years countries have been on high alert for H5N1 infections in people. In the mid-aughts, these viruses labeled as highly pathogenic, because of their lethality to poultry spread from Southeast Asia to South Asia and North Africa, leaving devastation in their wake. Millions of birds died from the virus or from the culling needed to stop the virus’ spread. And occasionally the virus jumped from poultry to people. In the past 20 years or so, roughly 880 people in 19 countries have been infected with H5N1. Just over half of them died. Fortunately, though, the virus to date has not acquired the capacity to spread easily from person to person and the fears that an H5N1 pandemic might be looming have faded. This case is unlikely to reignite them. The virus has changed over time, Todd Davis, who leads the CDC influenza division’s zoonotic virus team, said in an interview. The H5N1 viruses from 15 years ago or so had some different genes that appeared to allow them to trigger more severe illness when they infected people, he said. Those changes, particularly in the polymerase gene, are not present in most current day H5N1 viruses. And while the virus is still called H5N1, at a point a few years back it swapped genes with another flu virus, picking up a different neuraminidase. The new N1 is highly adapted to infect wild birds speeding its recent spread through Europe, Africa and North America but it seems less able now to infect people, Davis said. Since that reassortment event, the newly configured H5N1 has only been seen to have infected two people a man in the United Kingdom last December and the man in Colorado. The U.K. man kept poultry and the virus found its way into his flock. Though he tested positive, he experienced no symptoms. “There have only been two detected human cases since the virus was first detected in 2018,” Davis said. “That’s also pretty good evidence that this virus is just not as capable of infecting or causing disease in humans.” Still, flu viruses change constantly, and public health officials do not take lightly human infections with non-human flu viruses. “Our challenge at the moment is trying to keep up with those hundreds of people who are involved in culling operations or disinfection of infected farms, and making sure that we don’t see any changes in the virus that might increase the propensity for severe illness or transmissibility,” Davis said. “We’re still very much on high alert.”", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "yes", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that just over half of the roughly 880 people infected with H5N1 in the past 20 years have died.

But on Thursday, the CDC reported the first human case of the current dominant bird flu virus in the United States. An inmate in Colorado contracted the flu after exposure while working at a poultry farm. Still, public health officials say the risk of transmission in the general public is low. Bird flu's economic impact: Worst bird flu in years drives up egg prices, prompts precautions against spread to humans What is the bird flu? The bird flu, also known as the avian flu, refers to the disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted between birds. The dominant virus strain circulating currently is called H5N1. It is extremely contagious among birds, who spread it by shedding the virus in their saliva, feces and through nasal secretions. The virus originates in wild birds, but can spread to domesticated birds and lead to rapid, massive outbreaks. Avian influenza viruses are classified into two groups: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high death rates in infected birds, according to the CDC. Bird Flu symptoms in humans While possible, avian flu virus infections in humans are considered rare. The human infection reported in Colorado is only the second confirmed human infection of the present outbreak in the world. The first confirmed infection was reported in December in a United Kingdom man who had ducks living inside his home. He presented no symptoms. The man infected in Colorado showed mild symptoms of fatigue and was given antiviral medication for treatment. In China, officials confirmed the infection of a 4-year-old boy with a different strain, H3N8, after he reported a fever. Chinese health officials said his close contacts tested negative and that the strain posed little threat of wide spread. Bird flu symptoms have been reported to be largely the same as the seasonal flu. Symptoms can include cough, a sore throat, head and muscle aches, fatigue and shortness of breath. Severe infections can lead to pneumonia that requires hospitalizations. Sometimes infection can cause a fever. Less common symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization reported that 863 H5N1 cases have been confirmed globally in 18 countries since 2003, causing 455 deaths. But the H5N1 virus in circulation now is different from prior versions, the CDC said, and the risk posed by bird flu to the public's health is still low. Human to human transmission is rare. �ven when people have been infected with bird flu viruses there has rarely been onward spread from one infected person to another person,�he CDC website reads. Most people who become infected become so after �lose, prolonged and unprotected contact with infected birds.� Bird Flu prevention The best personal bird flu prevention is steering clear of prolonged exposure to birds. For those who work in close contact with poultry, hunt, or keep birds of their own, the CDC recommends implementing extra precautions like wearing gloves, mask and eye protection.

The beach was littered with dead and dying birds: male eider ducks, several species of gulls, a gannet, a puffin and no fewer than 26 pink-footed geese, which should by now have been on the way back to their Icelandic breeding grounds. In all, Stronach recorded 72 individual birds of 17 species at Loch Fleet national nature reserve on the east coast of Scotland on that one day, plus many more in the following days. But these birds had not been killed by a passing predator; nor were they the hapless victims of a sudden storm at sea. The cause of these deaths was a highly infectious �nd for birds, usually lethal �irus. Avian influenza H5N1 or, as it is more commonly known, bird flu, is back with a vengeance. What really worries Stronach is the range of species he found. �arlier this spring, we noticed that avian flu was restricted to the geese; but since then it has spread to other wildfowl, raptors and seabirds.� In previous years, it mainly occurred in winter; now, he says, it is affecting the breeding populations of iconic coastal species such as the eider. Elsewhere in Scotland earlier this month about 20 great skuas were found dead or dying on Fair Isle, with more reported from other breeding colonies on the Shetland Isles. This followed a serious outbreak of bird flu in 2021, when hundreds of skuas died. For any species, these deaths are a serious setback, especially at the height of the breeding season. But for great skuas and pink-footed geese, this news is especially troubling. Scotland hosts 60% of the global breeding population of great skuas, and 90% of the world population of pink-footed geese overwinter in the UK. For these two species, both of which are on the amber list of birds of conservation concern, bird flu could pose a serious threat to their long-term future. Bird flu is by no means confined to the UK. In December 2021, an outbreak in the Hula valley, in northern Israel, killed more than 5,000 cranes out of a wintering population of 30,000 birds. In what the Israeli government called �he deadliest wildlife disaster in the nation� history� workers wearing hazmat suits were photographed collecting the corpses. After the outbreak, farmers were instructed to slaughter hundreds of thousands of chickens. In Canada, a deadly strain of bird flu has already ravaged the poultry industry, resulting in almost 2 million chickens being killed. Now it has transferred not only to wild birds but mammals too. While the disease is usually confined to waterbirds, this particular strain has attacked crows, jays, gulls, raptors and even young foxes. The US is suffering what looks to become the worst ever outbreak of bird flu �hich farmers are blaming on transmission from wild birds. More than 37 million chickens and turkeys have so far been culled, with more to come. If just one bird tests positive, the farmers must destroy the entire flock. As one report noted: �n Wisconsin, lines of dump trucks have taken days to collect masses of bird carcasses and pile them in unused fields. Neighbours live with the stench of the decaying birds.�ven the bald eagle, America� national bird, has been affected. Could it also affect humans? The answer is, in very rare cases, yes �sually those, such as farmworkers, who have been in close and prolonged contact with infected domesticated birds. From 2003 to 2021, almost 500 people around the world died after catching the virus. Clearly, bird flu is something we need to take seriously. But Stronach is concerned that the current monitoring and surveillance system is designed to protect commercial poultry firms, and is not really adequate for wild bird populations. �e need urgent research to find out what other species it is found in, and, crucially, the mechanisms by which it is spreading,�e says. He is especially concerned that if dead birds are not collected after an outbreak, they may be scavenged by buzzards, red kites, gulls and skuas, thus spreading the disease even faster. Anyone who finds a dead or dying wild bird, which they suspect might have the disease, should not touch the corpse; nor should they attempt to rescue it if it is still alive.

{"id": "219", "title": "Bird flu is a huge problem now but we�re just one mutation away from it getting much worse", "date": "2022-11-09", "fulltext": "If the H5N1 virus jumps into the human population and more dangerous strains emerge, it could set off a new pandemic Lockdowns are a horrible experience, but fortunately one that is in the past now. Unless, that is, you�e a domestic bird in Britain. Since 7 November, a UK directive has instructed all farmers to keep their birds indoors as part of a stringent measure to stop the spread of avian flu, or the H5N1 virus. This measure is intended to avoid infection of domestic birds from wild birds, and will result in tens of millions of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys being brought inside for the foreseeable future. We�e also seen island birds affected, resulting in the shutdown of human visitors to the Isle of May in Scotland for five weeks, among other measures. Avian flu is known as one of the most infectious diseases: the R number, which was often discussed for the spread of Covid-19, can be as high as 100 for avian flu, meaning one bird can infect as many as 100 others. And the past few months have seen exponential spread of the virus, with Britain and Europe hit especially hard. A lab in Surrey that tests samples says it has seen a 600% increase in cases in the past three months. Why is this outbreak causing concern not just among scientists but also poultry farmers and government officials? Currently, avian flu outbreaks have been limited in humans because the virus doesn� spread easily between us. But this is a ticking timebomb. A mutation that makes this virus circulate more easily between humans is possible. This would be a gamechanger and raise the risk to humans considerably. And the more chances the virus has to jump into a human and mutate, the more likely it is a dangerous strain will emerge that could set off the next pandemic. While humans have been infected by birds, they are usually workers on poultry farms and those in close contact with infected birds, and even these instances have been rare. For example, on 3 November, two farm workers in Spain tested positive; it was the second known infection of humans in Europe since 2003. Infection is usually through handling sick or dead birds. Infected birds have the flu virus in their saliva, blood, mucus and faeces, and humans can get infected if they get this virus into the eyes, nose or mouth, or inhale droplets in close range (you can� get infected with avian flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs). And this virus is not mild. The fatality rate is thought to be high in humans: the World Health Organizationestimate is roughly 60% for H5N1. We currently have no vaccine to use in humans; nor does the seasonal flu vaccine work against avian flu. But while the chance of human transmission is a future worry, right now the virus is affecting people� livelihoods and farms, and putting hundreds of millions of domestic and wild birds in danger. Outbreaks in chickens can kill the entire local population; in other birds, such as ducks and geese, the disease is often mild or even asymptomatic. Ducks have even been called the �rojan horses�or the virus, given their ability to carry it and infect others while remaining unaffected themselves. Bird flu is highly infectious and poses a high risk to chickens and turkeys. As a result, if a farm tests positive for bird flu, the entire flock is culled. This can lead to hundreds of thousands to millions of pounds in lost income, and places enormous strain on poultry farms. It also has implications for the price and availability of turkeys and chickens going into Thanksgiving and Christmas. And, of course, it is a tremendous loss of bird life. The heart of the issue is how we raise and treat animals, and their interactions with humans. Poultry are often kept in difficult conditions where they are packed into close quarters and diseases easily pass through them. Some experts think that this more infectious strain developed in an industrial factory environment, where animals are kept in close quarters and viruses have the chance to circulate and mutate. And this is not just an issue with avian flu, but other infectious diseases as well. In places such as China and India, antibiotics are freely given to animals in order to prevent infection (especially in industrial farming) and to make them as large as possible. A survey of chicken farmers in China found that they all used antibiotics. The rationale here is cheap and fast meat to meet the growing demand in emerging economies. But this creates its own problems. Feeding antibiotics to animals can lead to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, and then humans such as farmers becoming infected with antibiotic-resistant infections. These then circulate in humans and reduce the effectiveness of one of the most powerful drugs in modern medicine. Chemotherapy, infections and surgeries of all kinds have become safer because of antibiotics. If the drugs don� work, these procedures become high-risk and life-threatening, as they used to be in the pre-antibiotic era. And as we�e learned, all it takes is for a person to get on a plane with a novel infectious disease for it soon to become a problem for everywhere else in the world. The major infectious disease threats in humans tend to come from animals: think of Sars-CoV-2, Sars, Mers, Ebola �he list goes on. There are more than a million viruses circulating in the animal kingdom, and it would be a fool� errand to try to stop that circulation. But we can limit the chances these have to jump into the human population, and limit their circulation in domestic animals. This requires taking the animal-human interface seriously, and knowing that while it� a major economic, animal welfare and farming problem now, the situation becoming even worse is just a mutation away. * Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate of roughly 60% for H5N1 according to the World Health Organization estimate.
