Today, with parts of Europe and North America in the midst of the worst outbreak on record, a global cohort of researchers is keeping cautious watch amid concerns about the impact the disease could have on humans. �here is concern about it having pandemic potential,�ays Wendy Blay Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University. �efore Covid was on anybody� radar, this was the one that we were all watching very closely.� The virus is currently considered a low risk to humans, she says. �ut anything that has the ability to replicate and evolve rapidly, and anything that has that ability to infect a lot of different hosts is kind of on borrowed time.� Much of the focus of experts is on H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza that has fuelled, in part, the surge in cases around the world. First identified at a goose farm in Guangdong, China in 1996, the virus has turned up in at least 63 species of wild birds and has shown itself capable of infecting mammals such as bobcats, harbour seals and bears. If it has become established in wild birds, it is far more complex to control it and predict where it will go next Nichola J Hill, University of Massachusetts The more the virus spreads, the greater the chances are that it may spill over into humans, says Thijs Kuiken, a professor in the department of viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam. Once the virus infects humans, the concern is that it could further adapt to allow human-to-human transmission. �he chance of this happening is very small, but the impact �f it does happen �s very big, because it means that we then have a new influenza pandemic,�e says, pointing to the 1918 flu, believed to have killed as many as 50 million people, as an example of a pandemic that has been linked to an avian influenza and originating in birds. As H5N1 crisscrosses the globe, its impact on humans has set off alarms; between 2003 and October 2022, the virus turned up in 865 humans in 21 countries, resulting in 456 deaths. While the cases �ost of them in Africa and Asia �ere linked to the handling of infected live poultry rather than human-to-human transmission, the figures suggest the virus �as a high case fatality rate in people who become infected� says Kuiken. Public health officials are taking few chances. In the UK, where a duck breeder tested positive for the virus in late 2021 after handling infected poultry, the Health Security Agency has been working to develop an �ff the shelf exercise�o prepare for an outbreak of avian flu among humans, the UKHSA told the Guardian in an email. In the Canadian province of British Columbia, public health officials recently warned doctors to watch out for avian flu infections among patients, after a spike in cases among poultry at local farms. The virus would probably require more than one or two changes to enable human-to-human transmission, says Ian Barr, the deputy director of the WHO� Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne. �e never really know with these viruses �ut they�e been with us for 18 years in various forms and they haven� yet gained that function of being easily transmissible to man,�ays Barr. �o, hopefully the virus finds that a difficult thing to do, but it� something which we�e not entirely knowledgable about.� He described it as a game of numbers. �he more viruses that are out there, the more species that they infect, the longer they hang around for, then the more chance there is for something to mutate or go awry or reassort with an unwanted consequence.� Efforts to halt the spread of this strain of virus have been complicated by its prevalence in wild birds, says Rebecca Poulson of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia. �e know birds move incredibly long distances,�he says. �nd if these birds are infected and are shedding these viruses as they move across the landscape, they can disseminate it quite far and wide in a really short amount of time.� The presence of the virus in wild birds and farmed poultry has allowed it to ping-pong between populations and amplify its spread, says Nichola J Hill, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. � think we used to cling to this idea that we can control the virus in poultry, we�e set, no problem,�he says. �nd now we�e facing a new era because if it has become established in wild birds, that� a far more complex situation in terms of figuring out how to control it and predict where it will go next.� What is clear, however, is the role our food system has played in getting us to this point, she says, citing the high densities of poultry seen in commercial farming and the genetic similarity of most of the animals. �ll of these amount to a situation which is ripe for the virus to get a foothold and then evolve towards virulence.�", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports 456 deaths out of 865 human cases, indicating a high mortality rate.

Public health experts say the risk of a jump to humans is still very low, but that this risk would be monitored through increased genomic surveillance and targeted testing of people who had been exposed to the virus. Concern was also sparked by a recent outbreak of avian flu at a mink farm in Spain and a mass mortality of seals in the Caspian sea that is possibly linked to the infection. �he virus is absolutely on the march,�rof Ian Brown, the director of scientific services at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha), told the BBC. He added that experts were �cutely aware of the risks�f avian flu becoming a pandemic like Covid. �his global spread is a concern,�e said. �e do need globally to look at new strategies, those international partnerships, to get on top of this disease.� Over the last two years, the UK has faced its largest outbreak of avian influenza, with more than 300 cases confirmed since October 2021 and with poultry farms all currently required to house birds indoors. Figures reported by the BBC show the virus has led to the deaths of about 208 million birds around the world and at least 200 recorded cases in mammals. In the UK, Apha has tested 66 mammals, including seals, and found nine otters and foxes were positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1. Such cases have been found in Durham, Cheshire and Cornwall in England; Powys in Wales; Shetland, the Inner Hebrides and Fife, Scotland. It is believed the animals had fed on dead or sick wild birds infected with the virus. �he species affected �oxes and otters �re known to scavenge,�aid Dr Alastair Ward, of the University of Leeds. �n all likelihood, the affected individuals will have scavenged infected wild bird carcasses, which may have had very high viral loads. Such high exposure is likely to have overwhelmed the mammal� immune system, resulting in infection.� There is currently no reason to suspect that the jump is due to a change in the virus� genetic makeup or that the risk to humans is greater from infected foxes or otters than from birds. However, scientists believe close monitoring is required to detect any mutations that could make a leap between species more likely. And reports of the apparent spread of the virus between mammals on a mink farm and the possibility of an outbreak in the wild seal population have heightened concern. Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: �hile these constant incursions of the virus into mammalian species does provide an opportunity for the virus to adapt to mammalian transmission, the natural barriers to this occurring are quite high and there is no indication of spread within these species. The risk to people right now therefore appears no more than it is for direct spread from infected birds.� In a recent report, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warned that the �apid and consistent acquisition of the mutation in mammals may imply this virus has a propensity to cause zoonotic infections� meaning it could jump to humans. The agency also raised concerns about limited wild bird and mammal surveillance and genomic data collection in England, and warned that there was not enough testing of people who had been contact with infected birds.

{"id": "258", "title": "Tracking the bird flu, experts see a familiar threat �nd a virus whose course is hard to predict", "date": "2023-02-08", "fulltext": "Veteran influenza epidemiologist Keiji Fukuda remembers vividly when he first became fearful that a virulent bird flu virus, H5N1, might be on the verge of triggering a devastating pandemic. The virus, seemingly out of nowhere, did something bird flu viruses were thought not to be able to do. It infected 18 people, killing six of them. That happened in 1997, in Hong Kong. A quarter century later, H5N1 has returned to the headlines, with an outbreak at a Spanish mink farm reported in mid-January triggering the latest round of fears that the virus might be inching closer to acquiring the ability to easily transmit among humans. The mink outbreak is concerning, there is no doubt about that. Minks are closely related to ferrets, the animals most often used as a proxy for people when scientists study the characteristics of flu viruses. But it’s important to remember that we’ve been somewhere like this before with this virus. Not precisely this spot H5N1 has a much larger geographic footprint now and it’s been found to infect many more species of mammals. But there have been periods, some spanning years, when H5N1 was wreaking havoc, doing things that until that point had been thought to be out of reach for bird flu viruses, raising global concerns a pandemic might be right around the corner. And then, unexpectedly, it quieted down for a while. So while scientists who have been studying it for a couple of decades have a very healthy respect for H5N1, a number with whom STAT spoke are hedging their bets about the path H5 may be on. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine. Enter your email Privacy Policy “I still think that this thing is as unpredictable as it has ever been,” said Ron Fouchier, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam who moved into the field of influenza research, at Erasmus, because of the 1997 H5N1 outbreak. Scientists there, along with a colleague from Hong Kong, were the first to report that the virus was a bird flu virus. “Trying to predict what H5N1 will do in the human population absolutely requires a great deal of scientific humility,” cautioned Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. “I will never, ever, take H5N1 for granted,” he said.“I just don’t know what it’s going to do.” Fukuda, who in 1997 was an influenza scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was sent to Hong Kong by the agency to help in the investigation of that first outbreak. “Everything was really new and the sense of things back then was that we were deeply, deeply afraid that this was the beginning of the next pandemic, of a really severe pandemic,” said Fukuda, who later went to the World Health Organization, where he served for a time as an assistant director-general. He retired from Hong Kong University at the end of 2021. How does he feel about the latest act in the multi-act play that is H5N1’s evolution, the spread into wild birds and poultry flocks throughout the Americas, and the lengthening list of mammalian species seen to have been infected with the virus? What does he think it portends? Fukuda gives the auditory equivalent of a shrug. “Anyone who tries to predict anything about influenza is a bit foolish and hasn’t been in the field very long,” he said. “I definitely have no idea what H5 is going to do, in 20 years whether we would have a similar discussion ‘Oh is it ever going to do anything?’ or if we’d be having a discussion saying ‘Oh, my God, couldn’t imagine that it was going to do that! That was really horrible,’” Fukuda said. “I think both of those discussions are plausible.” STAT asked a number of experts, all of whom have been studying or following H5N1 for years, how they assess the current situation and how they’d describe their individual level of concern. None of them ever stopped worrying about H5N1. None of them like what they’re seeing now. But most of them struggled to answer when asked if they are more worried now than earlier. Like in 2004, when a cluster of cases in a Vietnamese family raised the specter of limited person-to-person spread. Or 2005, when what was by then a poultry virus moved back into wild birds, which spread it to North Africa, Turkey and Europe. Or in the mid-to-late teens, when Egypt recorded more than 250 human cases in unsettling succession, 93 of them fatal. Since the 1997 outbreak, about 870 confirmed human cases have been detected. Just over half of those people died from the infection. UPCOMING EVENT STAT in DC: The Politics of Health Care On March 7, join STAT for a deep dive into the biggest discussions and decisions taking place in Washington. Privacy Policy “I grapple with this a little bit myself,” said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis. “The way I look at the current situation, I don’t think the virus itself is necessarily any more worrying than what we’ve been seeing for the past 20-plus years. But what worries me right now is that this is a change in the epidemiology and the ecology of the disease. So we’re absolutely seeing more chances of people coming in contact with this virus.” Fouchier agreed. “For me, that risk hasn’t changed. In ’97 there was a pandemic threat. And that pandemic threat has continued to exist, and we cannot really quantify the threat because we still don’t really understand what it takes,” said Fouchier, who in 2011 showed that with some mutations, H5N1 viruses could gain the capacity to transmit easily among ferrets. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, did similar work and got the same result. Both scientists had to fight to publish their studies, because of concerns the so-called gain of function work could provide a dangerous how-to guide for bad actors. (The debate this work sparked continues to this day, and it constrains with good reason, critics say the research that can be done to delve into what is keeping H5 from becoming a human flu virus.) Related: The future of pandemic preparedness: agile coordination around clinical trials Malik Peiris, a professor of virology at Hong Kong University, does not view the mink farm outbreak in Spain as H5N1’s third act. “I mean to me it’s just one big act,” he said. The outbreak, which occurred in October, saw H5N1 viruses move about a large mink farm in Galicia, in the northwest of Spain, sickening and killing a number of the animals. Eventually all the remaining minks there were nearly 52,000 animals before the outbreak began were euthanized. It is not clear how the virus entered the farm. But it seems possible, perhaps even probable, that at some point H5N1 spread from mink to mink. “Our findings also indicate that an onward transmission of the virus to other minks may have taken place in the affected farm,” the scientists who reported the event wrote in the journal Eurosurveillance. “This is suggested by the increasing number of infected animals identified after the confirmation of the disease and the progression of the infection from the initially affected area to the entire holding.” The mere idea of mink-to-mink transmission gives flu researchers pause. If a virus can transmit from one mammal to another, what’s to stop it from transmitting between other mammalian species like ours? The U.S. Department of Agriculture alone reports 110 reports of mammalian infections with H5N1 in 2022-2023 multiple types of bears, foxes, skunks, possums, racoons, even seals. It’s hard, though, to assess the significance of these infections in mammals. For starters, the virus has long had the capacity to infect mammals. Tigers and snow leopards in a zoo in Thailand died in late 2003 after being fed poultry infected with H5. Over the years infections in domestic cats and dogs, stone martens, and civet cats have been detected. “We have been there. But we also shouldn’t be lulled into complacency when there are new facts,” said Kanta Subbarao, director of the WHO’s Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne, Australia. Subbarao, who in 1997 was at the CDC, was the lead author on the first scientific publication characterizing the H5N1 virus. Related: Experimental flu vaccine, developed using mRNA, seen as potential game changer She said it’s not clear if the virus is entrenched in some animal populations which she said would “escalate our problems quite significantly” or if there is just so much virus in wild bird populations at this point that carnivores are becoming infected because they happen upon and eat infected birds. Even with the mink farm, one cannot say with certainty whether there was ongoing transmission or if the infected animals all had a common exposure, such as contaminated food they were fed poultry byproducts or contact with wild birds that could have moved about the netted cages the animals were housed in. Dead and sick birds infected with H5N1 were reported in the region in the weeks leading up to the outbreak. Webby doesn’t like the sheer geographic spread of the virus and the increasing reports of spillover events instances when the bird virus infects mammals though he noted the viruses don’t appear to have changed in significant ways. “If we look at the virus and the sequence of it, there’s nothing that suggests to us that it’s become more infectious. But of course we don’t know everything about that,” he said. “The virus may be the same, but there’s just a whole lot more of it out there.” “So absolutely worried from this new development in the ecology, epidemiology,” Webby said. “But luckily nothing that’s associated with that from the virologic side that has me running for the hills yet.” One thing that does mitigate some of the concern is the fact that in recent years, there have been few human infections with H5N1. Whereas at points in the first two decades of this century it wasn’t uncommon to have 20 or 30 cases a year, reports of human cases are rare these days, and often involve such mild disease it is not clear if the person who tested positive was infected or simply had viruses in their nostrils. A man in Colorado who was culling infected poultry last spring. Two poultry workers in Spain in November. A British man who had infected ducks in 2021. A recent H5 infection in a young girl reported from Ecuador is a rare severe case. One school of thought is that the decline in human cases is due to genetic changes in the virus that took place a while back. Related: The scientist behind Pfizer’s Covid vaccine says a flu pandemic is only a matter of time For years, the internal genes of H5N1 were unchanging. Their origin was another bird flu virus, H9N2. Many, even most, of the human infections with bird flu viruses were caused by viruses that had that combination of internal genes from H9N2, Fouchier said. The current version of H5N1, known by the unwieldy name 2.3.4.4b, acquired other internal genes through reassortment, a gene-swapping process that can occur when multiple viruses infect a single host. “If you like, the engine under the bonnet is different,” Peiris said. Fouchier worries primarily at the moment about the virus’ impact on biodiversity. Some species of wild birds are being decimated by the virus. But he also believes countries should be dusting off their pandemic influenza plans. “There will be a new pandemic for sure. Whether it is this one, I don’t know. But I think that the current situation is enough that countries actually [should] review their pandemic preparedness plans again,” Fouchier said. None of the scientists quoted here would disagree. But Fukuda, and one of his former colleagues from the CDC, Tim Uyeki, think at this point the world would be better off focusing on spillover threats plural than one single type of bird flu. “I think it’s a major problem for the agricultural industry. And certainly there is a public health threat, but right now, it’s probably low,” said Uyeki, the chief medical officer of CDC’s flu division. Uyeki joined the CDC the year after the 1997 outbreak, but was involved in the investigations of many of the outbreaks that happened from 2003 onward. Related: Why doesn’t the U.S. have at-home flu tests? “This is not the only virus that we should be concerned about for pandemic preparedness,” he stressed. “There are many other avian influenza A viruses circulating in birds and poultry that have sporadically transmitted to people and have caused a wide range of illness, including severe lower respiratory tract infection and fatal outcomes. And for that matter, if we even step back further and take a really big picture perspective… wherever you go in the world if you sample pigs, you will find swine influenza viruses.” Fukuda said it would be short-sighted to focus solely on H5 bird flu, suggesting the world needs to invest more in being ready to detect and mitigate outbreaks caused by the array of animal viruses that could jump from animals to people and start transmitting among us. He worries that the Covid-19 experience, rather than strengthening our response capacity, has eroded political support for this type of work. And Osterholm worries about what the Covid pandemic has done to public support for public health. “If we did have another pandemic right now I think it would be very difficult to get the public to do anything to try to limit or control transmission. That is to me a big setback,” he said. Fukuda concurred. “What has become clear to me over time is that the big challenge is not the viruses. That’s not what gives me a pit in my stomach,” he said. “The real challenge is whether people, whether governments, whether policymakers have the ability to actually address the challenge in the way that needs to be done.

The largest ever bird flu outbreak had already spilled over into otters and foxes in the UK, with about 70 mammals having tested positive for the (HPAI) H5N1 virus. The seal carcasses were sent for screening last year and the results have come back positive, according to the Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme (SMASS). �hree out of the four harbour seals and one of the two grey seals from 2021 and early 2022 tested positive for HPAIV H5N1,�aid SMASS in a statement. The animals were found in Aberdeenshire, Highlands, Fife and Orkney. �e also want to check our more recent cetacean cases for evidence of spillover,�t said. As well as ripping through wild bird populations around the world, H5N1 has been found in dolphins, domestic cats, leopards and grizzly bears. Earlier this week the Peruvian government said nearly 580 sea lions had died from it in seven protected marine areas. Generally it is believed mammals are getting infected by scavenging on dead or sick wild birds, but sea lions live in colonies. This has raised concerns it could now be spreading within mammal populations in the wild. Scientists are analysing the genetic sequences of the virus in the colonies in Peru to establish if that is the case. �e need to wait for that analysis,�aid Prof Ian Brown, the director of scientific services at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha). � think we need to be cautious before we assume viruses transmitting between the sea lions.� It follows an outbreak at a mink farm in Spain, which was the first indication it could be spreading within mammal populations. It is believed the American mink were infected by H5N1 after coming into contact with wild gulls who were able to access their food. More than 50,000 mink were euthanised. The evidence suggests it was spreading between the mink themselves, says Ursula H�le, a research professor at the University of Castilla. �t looks like it was at least for this particular virus an isolated event,�he said. �e don� really know, but there� definitely increasing evidence for bird-to-mammal and mammal-to-mammal transmission.� If it starts being able to spread between mammals there are concerns humans could be more vulnerable. �e�e seeing a bit of a step-change in the spread of this infection, and we shouldn� sit idle because obviously we know what happened with Covid,�aid Brown. He said it was possible to start taking preparatory steps for making a human vaccine for H5N1 but it would be �oolhardy�o make a vaccine now as it was impossible to know what strain might jump into humans, in the unlikely event that did happen. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the situation �eeds to be monitored closely�ut the risk to humans remained low. Experts say the virus would probably require more than one or two changes for human-to-human transmission to be a real risk, but the impacts could be huge. There have been nearly 870 cases of bird flu in humans over the past 20 years and 457 were fatal, according to the WHO. The virus is also devastating wild bird populations across the globe, meaning it is reaching places previously never exposed to such diseases. This means they can carry it to the most pristine parts of the planet, possibly spreading it into other endangered species. Brown said: � think it is really quite a worry that the virus has already reached so far down into South America. And we have to consider that there are definitely risks for some biodiversity in terms of Antarctica.

Some experts are concerned about the possibility that the H5N1 virus could one day evolve to more easily spread from birds to mammals. Although the risk to humans remains low, speculation about the virus has caused worry that the bird flu outbreak could develop into a larger threat. The Washington Post spoke to a number of experts to answer common questions about bird flu, the risk to humans and pets, and how the outbreak is affecting food prices. Here's what they had to say. What is bird flu?Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in about 6,000 wild birds and affected more than 58 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since the start of 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"It's been the most serious outbreak for birds that we've had in the U.S. of these highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in recent memory,\" said Nicole Nemeth, an associate professor of pathology and head of the wildlife research and diagnostic service at the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm. How does bird flu affect humans?It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds �hether the birds are dead or alive �r with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces. Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks �robably from eating infected wild birds �xperts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. In fact, since the start of the current outbreak, only one human case has been reported in the United States. People who work closely with infected poultry are at an increased risk of becoming infected. Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis �n eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes �o more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said. The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain. A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus �y sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example �o develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. \"In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia,\" he said, and then \"the fatality rate is very high.\" Human-to-human transmission of the virus is very rare, Schaffner said. \"If that happens, that human being is usually a very close caregiver of the sick person,\" he said. What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans?Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms �ever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing. The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the last 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said. Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat. How is it treated?People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said. Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans?Yes. Federal authorities have vaccines against A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) bird flu viruses that could be used if these viruses were to start spreading among the human population, the CDC said. Can bird flu kill humans?Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare. According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and 2023, there were 868 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 globally. Of those who were infected, 53 percent �r 457 �ied. Between 2021 and 2022, six confirmed cases of human bird flu infections were reported to the WHO, and two of those infected died. While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Could bird flu become the next pandemic?Each time there is highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person. That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people �a statistical phenomenon,\" Schaffner said. Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchanged of genetic material is a random event. \"If anything, the odds are against it,\" Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although this strain has infected some mammals �ncluding mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm �that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans,\" he said. Can dogs and cats catch bird flu?Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said. Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons. \"If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection,\" Cardona said. Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs?No. Humans cannot become infected by eating eggs or fully cooked poultry. However, according to the CDC, \"uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia.\" The CDC advises that \"it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States.\" Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry �nd other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry �re typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. \"That's why there's so much death associated, in many ways,\" to the current outbreak, she said. \"It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products. They don't even make it into your pet food.\" What about my backyard chickens?People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said. Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease. Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying. People who have backyard chickens should still take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said. Has bird flu affected food prices?The outbreak drove up the price of Thanksgiving turkeys in November, but its impact continues to affect egg prices, which is dealing with a number of supply chain issues as well. According to the Agriculture Department, the bird flu has wiped out more than 44 million egg-laying hens, or roughly 4 to 5 percent of production. Does risk vary by state or country?Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. \"The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable,\" Iqbal said. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world. Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu?China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have also focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality. But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks. The United Kingdom, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly. Amid the current H5N1 outbreak, some European countries, including France and the Netherlands, are testing the effectiveness of bird vaccination. In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds who may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed.", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": "same problems", "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate of 53% for H5N1 cases.

{"id": "265", "title": "Why sick minks are reigniting worries about bird flu", "date": "2023-02-18", "fulltext": "NEW YORK (AP) � recent bird flu outbreak at a mink farm has reignited worries about the virus spreading more broadly to people. Scientists have been keeping tabs on this bird flu virus since the 1950s, though it wasn't deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong among visitors to live poultry markets. As bird flu hits more and varied animals, like at the mink farm, the fear is that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic. Scientist say another kind of bird flu was likely behind the devastating 1918-1919 flu pandemic, and avian viruses played roles in other flu pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009. Still, the risk to the general public now is low, says Dr. Tim Uyeki of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A look at the bird flu virus and why it is getting renewed attention: WHAT IS BIRD FLU? Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but some others chiefly occur in animals. For example, there are flus that occur in dogs, plus pig �r swine �lu viruses. And then there are avian viruses that spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry. The bird flu virus drawing attention today �ype A H5N1 �as first identified in 1959, by investigators looking into a flu outbreak in chickens in Scotland. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself. By 2007, the virus was found in more than 60 countries. In the U.S., it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations or backyard flocks in 47 states. Since the beginning of last year, tens of millions of chickens have died of the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading, one of the reasons cited for soaring egg prices. HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE GET BIRD FLU? The Hong Kong outbreak in 1997 was the first time this bird flu was blamed for severe human illness. Out of 18 people infected, six died. To contain the outbreak, the Hong Kong government closed live poultry markets, killed all the birds in the markets, and stopped bringing in chickens from southern China. It worked, for a while. Symptoms are the similar to that of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people don't have noticeable symptoms, but some develop severe. life-threatening pneumonia. Globally, nearly 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization in 20 countries. But the pace has slowed and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years. In the vast majority of cases, the infected people got it directly from infected birds. The first and only U.S. case occurred just last April. A prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado, in the western part of the state. His only symptom was fatigue and he recovered. CAN IT SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE? In some instances, investigators concluded that the bird flu virus apparently did spread from one person to another. That happened in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, China and Pakistan, most recently in 2007. In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home. Scientists do not believe it can spread easily through casual contact, as seasonal flu can. But viruses mutate and change. Scientists worry about the ever-increasing number of opportunities for bird flu to mix with other flu viruses in infected people or animals and mutate, making it easier to spread to people. It wouldn't take much for that to happen \"and then we would be in a really tough situation,�aid Dr. Luis Ostrosky, chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. The CDC's Uyeki said the most worried he's been about H5N1 was during the earlier clusters. That kind of human-to-human spread does not appear to be happening right now, he said. WHAT HAPPENED AT THE MINK FARM? Recent concern among public health experts has been fueled, in part, by detection of infections in a variety of mammals. The growing list includes foxes, raccoons, skunks, bears and even marine mammals like seals and porpoises. Officials in Peru said three sea lions found dead in November tested positive for, and the recent deaths of hundreds of others may be due to bird flu. Then last month, a European medical journal reported on a bird flu outbreak in October at a mink farm in Spain with nearly 52,000 animals, where the illness spread like wildfire. The mink were fed poultry, and wild birds in the region had been found to have bird flu. But researchers said that however it started, they believe the virus then spread from mink to mink � worrisome scenario. No workers were infected, though they wore masks as part of COVID-19 precautions. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, said the outbreak virus is being watched for mutations that could make it more easily transmitted to people, and potentially between people. \"That's the real worry,\" said Nuzzo. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute� Science and Educational Media Group.

The programme would provide rapid information about the dangers posed by the disease.

The moves follow last week� news that an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia has died from H5N1, the flu strain that is being spread around the globe by migrating birds and is infecting poultry farms. Investigators are now trying to establish if infected birds were the cause of the Cambodian case, rather than human-to-human transmission. At present, evidence suggests the H5N1 virus does not pass easily to people although scientists have urged care and caution. �iruses constantly evolve, and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population,�aid Dr Meera Chand, incident director for avian influenza at the UKHSA.

{"id": "270", "title": "As bird flu surges, the nightmare scenario of another pandemic illustrates just how poorly prepared America would be.", "date": "2023-02-26", "fulltext": "Whatever happened to our Roaring Twenties? In the first year of the pandemic, it was common to hear predictions that however brutal and harrowing the near future seemed, the world would find itself, at some point, celebrating the end of Covid-19 -- perhaps in a grand bacchanal to recall the dizzying decade that followed the Spanish flu of 1918 and 1919, which killed 675,000 Americans. But that end never really came, not definitively. That the pandemic is no longer seen as an emergency is obvious; just look outside. But the country didn't turn the page so much as limp forward, through a fog of exhaustion and loneliness and long Covid, into the dawn of a new period in which the coronavirus has retreated for most as an everyday threat but may well nevertheless continue as gothic background noise, killing tens of thousands of Americans each year. A true postpandemic period may still arrive, perhaps even a real Roaring Twenties. But in recent weeks, as researchers have registered one after another mammalian outbreak of the avian influenza H5N1, another possibility has loomed into view, as well: a back-to-back pandemic, potentially driven by a disease that, over the past several decades, has killed about half the humans with known infections. There have been few cases of human-to-human transmission of bird flu, which is the main reason its incursion into human populations has been so limited. The World Health Organization has said that the risk to humans is low, but also that ''we must prepare for any change in the status quo.'' There are reasons to think that, if the virus did make such an evolutionary jump, it could bring with it a significant reduction in severity. We also don't know exactly how rapidly such a disease would be transmitted among humans, though we have seen some eye-popping mammalian outbreaks over the last year: in minks, most notably, at a Spanish farm; but also in bears, seals, raccoons and foxes, to name just a few of those populations recently infected in the United States. In Peru, roughly 600 sea lions died. The possibility of a second pandemic raises the obvious question of whether we have learned anything from the last one. Is there any reason to expect that, even with new political leadership, the country's response to a new global outbreak -- of H5N1 or something else altogether -- would be more coherent or more coordinated? To the contrary, contemplating the possibility of a new pandemic in the near future suggests all the ways that America, in its rush to return to normal, failed to do all the things that might have secured a lasting normalcy. Consider the state of the country's institutional public-health apparatus: Since 2020, there has been no meaningful nationwide disease-surveillance network erected or even planned. (Our patchwork surveillance of avian flu has given us only a crude sense of where it is spreading now among animals.) The F.D.A. is still moving too slowly on some things and too quickly on others. There is no Operation Warp Speed-style funding plan for rapid vaccine development; indeed, the president who can claim credit for it has stopped touting it as one of his achievements. Billions of dollars in funding for things like air-filtration systems in schools have gone unspent, leaving public buildings no better prepared to endure airborne disease than they were before Covid. There has been little progress to date on lab safety -- which even lab-leak skeptics will acknowledge is an ongoing risk -- and early candidates for more expansive coronavirus vaccines, which could protect against many different pathogens in the same family as SARS-CoV-2, are only in early trials. (Pan-influenza vaccines are moving slowly, too.) As we now know all too well, pandemic containment isn't just a matter of policy and public investment. It's a complex web of leadership, social trust and public buy-in -- along with a fair amount of chance. But it is hard to believe that the country is now capable of more solidarity and vigilance than it was in early 2020. Vaccine skepticism may not necessarily outlast this pandemic, but the signs are worrying, and there has been precious little policy focus on what can overcome that skepticism. Faith in public-health officials' management of the pandemic has declined, too, and the Biden administration, which was champing at the bit on Inauguration Day, is now offering public-health guidance close to ''you do you'' -- pulling back pandemic response, dumping millions of people off expanded Medicaid coverage and turning the provision of new tests and booster shots to the private market. There are some encouraging signs when it comes to bird flu: federal discussion of a mass poultry-vaccination program and the ''rapid'' rollout of existing avian-influenza vaccines for humans. But each of these projects could take at least six months, and almost certainly we would find ourselves wasting the early stage of a new pandemic -- and possibly more than that -- relitigating debates over the last one. You can see the fault lines already, with those who believe the country's Covid response went too far taking to social media to mock the suggestion that any of the same measures -- social distancing, masking, school closures -- might be implemented to hold off a new contagion, as though it were irrelevant that this new one might be many times deadlier. Over time, fatality rates considerably higher than those encountered with Covid would (one hopes) shake a lot of the country's current mitigation fatalism -- because a disease that kills 5 percent of those infected looks very different from one that kills only 1 percent. But a deadlier pandemic would probably also, perversely, reignite arguments over our response to SARS-CoV-2, because such a fatality rate would make that disease look relatively mild -- and the global response to it much more significant -- by comparison. Beginning in 2020, Covid minimizers compared it to the flu, which kills a fraction as many (and tends to infect many fewer). If, in the next pandemic, fatality rates were five times higher, would minimizers dismiss it similarly -- ''It's just Covid''? Already, we've normalized quite a lot more dying than almost any American thought possible in early 2020, when the country bunkered down in response to warnings that the disease could kill 100,000 to 200,000 people. Normalization isn't just a matter of the vaccine skeptics in your timeline. On the campaign trail, Joe Biden declared that any president responsible for 220,000 American deaths should not remain president; he has now presided over 700,000. In 2020, we were panicked; now we're exhausted. In 2021, many doctors left the profession, and those still working are often reporting burnout. As many as half of nurses have reported in surveys that they are considering leaving the profession, as is one in five doctors. Even in the ''post-emergency'' phase of the pandemic, national hospital capacity is under strain, and rural hospitals are closing at a distressing rate. This is not to say that, in facing any potential new pandemic, failure is inevitable. But even a limited outbreak, successfully contained through mitigation or outraced through rapid vaccine production, would still represent a grim premonition -- an unmistakable signal to many that the world has now entered what epidemiologists have been memorably calling the Pandemicine. That is, a new epoch, defined as much by the increasing frequency of viral spillover events as the Anthropocene has been defined by the human influence on the planet. When we give our era names like these, it makes the disjunctures seem inevitable, almost preordained. But human fallout from new disease is no more inevitable than from carbon emissions. Here, the cost of accumulated indifference could be similarly high, and not just in the obvious human toll. In welcoming eight billion of us unmistakably to a new pandemic age, a back-to-back outbreak would cast a sort of permanent viral shadow on the decades to come -- a legacy less like the Roaring Twenties than the Great Depression.

{"id": "272", "title": "Vaccine Makers Are Preparing for Bird Flu", "date": "2023-03-02", "fulltext": "Minks in Spain, seals in Scotland, sea lions and dolphins in South America: a number of mammal species have recently been found to be infected with H5N1, a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza. Avian flu is not new; epidemiologists have been studying it for decades. But the detection of the virus in mammals has many concerned about the potential that it could spill over to humans and cause a larger outbreak. As the world enters the fourth year of a global pandemic caused by a virus that likely came from an animal, concern over another virus potentially uprooting our lives is valid. H5N1 has infected humans before, although human-to-human transmission has rarely been observed. And while the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the mortality rate of avian flu in humans is around 56 percent, many experts believe it� likely to be much lower if the virus becomes more transmissible. One reason avian flu is so lethal is that it infects the lower respiratory tract, which can lead to respiratory failure. If it were to mutate to infect the upper respiratory tract and spread more easily, it would probably cause milder illness. Yet even a virus that causes mild or moderate illness in many people can have a serious toll, as we�e seen with the COVID pandemic. So efforts are underway to develop vaccines to protect against such a form of bird flu. Bird flu has spilled over to humans before�n fact, just last week a girl in Cambodia died from H5N1 (although not the same strain as the one that is sickening birds worldwide). \"Each time we see this happen, we get these spurts of cases, [and] people say, �ere it comes; it� going to happen,� says Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota� Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. But he stressed that H5N1 is likely not an imminent threat to humans. Others agree. �� keeping a close eye on it as an expert, but as a member of the community, as a parent and someone who [has been] recently experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, I� not worried about this right now,�ays Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. �his is an animal health issue right now that has a theoretical risk to become a human health issue.� Avian influenza viruses infect birds by attaching to a receptor in their respiratory tract. In order for the virus to become a human virus and start circulating from person to person in the population, it would have to be able to attach itself to the human version of this receptor�omething it hasn� yet evolved to do. �t� a really dangerous time to be a bird,�ndrew Pavia, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah, adds. �ut as of today, the risk to humans remains very low. Our concern is what� going to happen as it circulates more and more.� It� unfortunately nearly impossible to predict when this jump could happen. �one of us know when the next influenza pandemic will emerge. It could be tomorrow [or] it could be years from now, and we don� know which of the viruses will become the next pandemic virus,�sterholm says. �t the outset, you have to say there is uncertainty, with one exception: there will be a pandemic.� The U.S. is somewhat equipped to handle avian flu: there is a stockpile of egg-based flu vaccines for the H5N1 strain. Eggs are one of the most common ways to make a flu vaccine. To create it, manufacturers inject an inactivated or weakened virus into a fertilized chicken egg, incubate the egg for a few days while the virus multiplies and then harvest the virus to use for the vaccine. The country has a secret chicken stockpile in undisclosed locations across the U.S. just in case we need to make egg-based vaccines quickly�uch as during a flu pandemic. It may be concerning that this vaccine strategy depends on an animal that is highly susceptible to the flu in question. But several experts told Scientific American that there are high levels of biosecurity at the chicken facilities in order to avoid bird flu contamination. Alternatives to egg-based vaccines exist. Since the early 2010s, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been partnering with CSL Seqirus, one of the largest influenza vaccine manufacturers, to develop vaccines grown in cells in a laboratory. The pandemic preparedness vaccine AUDENZ, which targets the H5N1 subtype specifically, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And although it� impossible to determine which virus will cause the next pandemic, CSL Seqirus has a library of viruses that have the potential to infect humans. And the company is constantly looking for candidate vaccine viruses that it can tailor to a specific pathogen. �e use data [for] one of the avian strains to create a mock-up file,�ays Marc Lacey, who runs CSL Seqirus� pandemic preparedness and response team. The team members basically identify certain viruses, use them to create vaccines and conduct some of the early safety studies so that if an avian flu strain evolves into a true pandemic strain transmitting between humans, they will be ready to go with an adequate vaccine. Lacey says that his company would be able to supply the U.S. government with 150 million doses within the first six months of a pandemic being declared, but he thinks the scale-up potential could be higher, especially if multiple manufacturers could help produce it. Because there are eight billion people in the world, scale-up and widespread collaboration across countries would be necessary to make enough vaccine. There are also efforts to apply messenger RNA (mRNA) technology�uch as that used for some of the COVID vaccines�o flu vaccines. According to University of Washington microbiologist Deborah Fuller, these efforts range from developing a universal flu vaccine to creating a �ultivalent�accine that targets only a few subtypes�r versions of the virus (like a typical seasonal flu vaccine does). One advantage of mRNA technology is its speed of production. And because of the COVID pandemic, there is now more infrastructure to mass-produce doses. �NA vaccines can be designed extremely quickly�ou only need the genetic sequence of what the new variant is that� emerging, and within weeks, [you] can have a vaccine already tested in animal models,�uller says. Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, is also investigating mRNA flu vaccines. He� part of a research team developing a 20-subtype mRNA flu vaccine that includes an H5N1 strain (although not the one currently circulating in birds). The team recently published its findings in Science. Hensley� lab is now developing a single-strain vaccine tailored to the current bird flu strain�nd is already testing it in laboratory animals. He emphasizes that, as with the COVID vaccines, his vaccines are meant to prevent serious illness and death, not infection. But even the 20-subtype vaccine is expected to provide some protection against the new strain. �hen we developed [that] vaccine, the idea was to create one that could induce a certain level of immune memory against every subtype,�ensley says. �ur goal wasn� to predict which influenza subtype would cause the next pandemic or which strain would cause it. Rather the vaccine [would induce] some level of immune memory against every subtype so that it would limit disease and death caused by new pandemic strains.� A vaccine is only part of pandemic preparedness�ou also need effective treatments. As Pavia says, researchers aren� working from scratch trying to create something like the COVID antiviral Paxlovid, which took nearly two years to get to market. FDA-approved antivirals for influenza, such as Tamiflu, already exist and will be important for reducing deaths during a flu pandemic. Pavia is also hopeful that the U.S. could quickly adapt diagnostic tests to match an outbreak strain of pandemic flu. �e have better tools and better knowledge about influenza than we did about coronaviruses. In many ways, we would be a step ahead,�avia says. �ut what I worry about is our political capacity to respond. We need to continue to [increase] awareness and continue preparation efforts.

{"id": "278", "title": "US focuses on limiting spread amid record bird flu season, but vaccines could be a possibility in the", "date": "2023-03-10", "fulltext": "The Biden administration is monitoring what experts say is the deadliest outbreak of bird flu that the US has ever seen, and officials are considering a \"range of options\" on how to respond. The outbreak is not currently considered a serious threat to human health, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, there have only been a handful of cases of avian flu in humans, mostly in people who had direct contact with infected birds or with surfaces contaminated with their excretions. There was one human case last year in the United States, a Colorado man who got sick after culling infected birds. He was isolated and treated with an antiviral. More than 860 total cases of bird flu have been reported among humans in 19 countries since 2003, and more than half of those cases were fatal, according to the CDC. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesussaid in February that the risk to humans still remains low. But given the large number of infected birds, he added, \"we cannot assume that will remain the case.\" There have been 6,356 cases in wild birds in all 50 states, according to the CDC, but there are probably many more. In 47 states, there have been multiple outbreaks among poultry, involving more than 58.6 million birds. It has also shown up in noncommercial backyard flocks, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The disease has shown up in other animals in the US, too, including bears, foxes, raccoon, possums, mountain lions, bobcats and even a bottlenose dolphin. As the virus moves through mammals, chances go up that it could mutate and spread more easily among humans. The CDC is able to watch for the virus in communities through the labs it uses to monitor more typical flu viruses. The agency also told CNN that it is also exploring whether manufacturers might want to make commercial tests for these viruses more broadly available. The Biden administration said it has also been watching the situation carefully. \"As a part of the administration's focus on addressing any infectious disease with urgency and preparedness, we continue to monitor the avian flu outbreak. There are a range of options the United States regularly considers when there is any outbreak that could affect the security and safety of the United States' food supply,\" a National Security Council official told CNN. \"Right now, we are focused on promoting and enhancing high-impact biosafety practices and procedures.\" Biosafety procedures typically include enhanced disinfection practices for people who work with birds. In November, the CDC recommended that people who interact with birds that look sick -- even in backyard flocks -- should wear disposable gloves, boots, eye protection and an N95 respirator or a face mask. \"CDC continues to take any threat of infectious disease seriously and assesses the avian flu's current risk to humans as very low. The Department of Agriculture continues to respond quickly whenever the virus is detected among bird populations,\" the National Security Council official said. The CDC says the risk assessment tool that it uses to understand a virus' potential as a pandemic risk determined that if these H5N1 viruses were to mutate into a version that could spread easily and efficiently in people, the pandemic risk is \"moderate,\" and the public health impact of such an event also would be of moderate severity. \"This is why it's so important that both the public health and animal health side take precautions to limit exposures among animal species and between animals and people, and thus limit the chances that some type of virus reassortment event that may allow these viruses to infect people easily and spread easily between people,\" the agency said in an email to CNN. General precautions include containing animal outbreaks and limiting exposure for the public. That includes avoiding close contact with sick birds, cooking poultry fully and not eating raw eggs. Another precaution is to take steps toward a vaccine, just in case, and there are efforts under way. Exploring vaccines for humans and animals Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, and colleagues have been working on a vaccine candidate that could be used in humans if the virus started circulating among people. \"We think that the vaccine will elicit very high levels of neutralizing antibodies against this specific strain because it's basically perfectly matched to what's circulating now,\" Hensley said. The vaccine seems to work well in the lab, he said, and the researchers plan to test it on chickens this spring. The CDC says it recently produced a candidate vaccine virus, an influenza virus that manufacturers can use to make a vaccine, that is nearly identical to a viral protein detected in birds and mammals. It could be used to produce a vaccine for people \"if needed.\" \"Such a vaccine would be expected to provide good protections against circulating H5N1 viruses,\" the CDC said. The agency said it has shared this with vaccine manufacturers. For years, the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, a division of the US Department of Agriculture, has also been working on a vaccine for potential emergency use in animals. There may be an advantage to vaccinating poultry to reduce the chances that the virus could mutate. Vaccinating poultry against avian flu, is \"not something that's really done in our country, but I think it's time to think about that for sure,\" Hensley said. Farm animals, including birds, are already vaccinated for other diseases. Chickens, for example, routinely get vaccinated for Marek's disease, which caused by a herpesvirus. They're also vaccinated against Newcastle disease, a respiratory illness; infectious bronchitis; and acute necrotic proventriculitis, a viral disease that affects the immune system. Avian flu may someday be included in that list, according to a spokesperson for the USDA. \"In the interest of leaving no stone unturned in the fight against (highly pathogenic avian flu), USDA continues to research vaccine options that can protect poultry from this persistent threat,\" the spokesperson told CNN. Vaccination, though, is not the first option. \"From vaccine development to production timelines to dissemination to flocks, there are many factors that make implementing a vaccine strategy a challenge, and it would take time to deliver an effective vaccine,\" the USDA said. So first and foremost, \"we are pursuing collaborative efforts with poultry farmers and companies on education, training, and implementation of comprehensive biosecurity measures. Biosecurity is the best and most prudent approach we have to mitigate the impact of the disease today.\" CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report.", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports that more than half of the human cases of bird flu have been fatal, indicating a high mortality rate.

{"id": "291", "title": "Lab-created bird flu virus accident shows lax oversight of risky 'gain of function' research", "date": "2023-04-11", "fulltext": "This exclusive article is adapted from former USA TODAY investigative reporter Alison Young� forthcoming book \"Pandora� Gamble: Lab Leaks, Pandemics, and a World at Risk,\" which will be released April 25. In this excerpt, Young reveals for the first time details of a December 2019 lab safety breach involving one of the world� most infamous lab-created �ain of function�iruses �nd the efforts that were made to downplay the event, avoid notifying health authorities and oversight bodies, and keep the public and policymakers in the dark. Inside the high-security Influenza Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, two experienced scientists were pulling ferrets out of their HEPA-filtered cages on a Monday in December 2019. Another researcher, still in training, was also in the room to watch and learn. One by one, the animals were put into a biosafety cabinet, where a solution was washed into their nostrils. It� a procedure used to collect evidence of infection, and this particular experiment involved exposing the animals to a highly controversial lab-engineered strain of H5N1 avian influenza virus. The virus they were working with that day was far from ordinary, and there should have been no room for the safety breach that was about to happen and the oversight failures that followed. The experiment underway involved one of two infamous lab-made bird flu viruses that had alarmed scientists around the world when their creation became widely known nearly a decade earlier. In each case, scientists had taken an avian influenza virus that was mostly dangerous to birds and manipulated it in ways that potentially increased its threat to humans. In nature, the H5N1 virus has rarely infected humans. But when people have been sickened, usually through close contact with infected birds, more than half died. So it is fortunate that the H5N1 virus isn� capable of spreading easily from person to person. If the virus were ever to evolve in ways that gave it that ability, it could cause a devastating pandemic. 'Gain of function' research created controversial flu viruses And yet in late 2011 the world learned that two scientific teams �ne in Wisconsin, led by virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka, and another in the Netherlands, led by virologist Ron Fouchier �ad potentially pushed the virus in that direction. Each of these labs had created H5N1 viruses that had gained the ability to spread through the air between ferrets, the animal model used to study how flu viruses might behave in humans. The ultimate goal of this work was to help protect the world from future pandemics, and the research was supported with words and funding by two of the most prominent scientists in the United States: Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH� National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Kawaoka contended it would be �rresponsible not to study�ow the virus might evolve in nature. �ome people have argued that the risks of such studies �isuse and accidental release, for example �utweigh the benefits. I counter that H5N1 viruses circulating in nature already pose a threat,�e said at the time. Yet these groundbreaking scientific feats set off a heated international debate over the ethics and safety of �ain of function�esearch. The controversy continues to this day. Concerns about the safety of biological research have taken on heightened urgency in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and growing acceptance of the possibility that it was caused by a lab accident in China. In February, it was revealed that analysts at the U.S. Department of Energy had joined the FBI in leaning toward a lab accident as the most likely source of the pandemic, though other U.S. intelligence agencies lean toward a natural origin or are undecided. Where's the apology?: COVID may have leaked out of a Chinese lab after all. So much for 'misinformation.' Former U.S. surgeon general: We'll never know the full truth about COVID-19 origins. Political infighting won't help. The story of how the H5N1 viruses came to be created �nd how the University of Wisconsin and the Kawaoka lab would later respond to the 2019 safety breach during the ferret experiment �aises uncomfortable questions about the tremendous trust the world places in these kinds of labs. We are trusting that every hour of every day their layers of laboratory containment equipment are working properly, that all of their employees are sufficiently trained, qualified and attentive, and that their written safety and incident response protocols are followed in real-life practice. When something goes wrong, we are trusting that the labs will immediately notify local public health officials who are responsible for preventing outbreaks and the federal authorities who oversee the safety of experiments with genetically engineered organisms. Given that so much about this work is shrouded in secrecy, what happened in Wisconsin raises the question: Should the public give this trust blindly? 'Miscommunication' over quarantine alarmed NIH a decade ago In 2013, six years before the 2019 safety incident with the ferret experiment at Kawaoka� lab in Wisconsin, another member of his research team accidentally pierced their finger with a needle that had an engineered H5N1 virus on it. It was a moment of poor judgment, human error around 6:30 p.m. Nov. 16, 2013, that set off a series of emergency calls that would eventually raise concerns in the nation� capital. An expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told officials at Wisconsin� state health department that while the likelihood the scientist would develop symptoms of H5N1 was �ow,�he needlestick �hould be considered a serious exposure�nd treated aggressively. The chief medical officer at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services told the university that the researcher would need to quarantine for seven days and take a treatment-level dose of Tamiflu twice a day for 10 days. Six months earlier, while seeking funding and approval for the controversial experiments, Kawaoka had assured officials at the National Institutes of Health that the university had a designated quarantine apartment. But it turned out that wasn� the case. So lab officials told the researcher� family to pack up their belongings and go to a hotel. And the injured researcher was sent to quarantine at home. Officials in the NIH office responsible for overseeing research with engineered organisms were alarmed to learn that the university didn� have a dedicated quarantine facility for such emergencies. �his policy is not what was communicated to us in Dr. Kawaoka� application to perform research with mammalian transmissible strains of H5N1,�rote Dr. Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, acting director of the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, in a letter to the university. A researcher� home, the NIH told the university, was not an appropriate quarantine site for Kawaoka� high-risk studies because influenza viruses can be transmissible through the air, and many residences are in high-occupancy buildings, like apartments, that share air exchange and other infrastructure. Trying to provide an explanation, university officials told NIH there had been a �iscommunication�etween Kawaoka and the university� administration. Wisconsin officials noted that the needlestick was not expected to put the researcher at high risk of infection, and that this engineered virus �as determined not to be a mammalian-transmissible strain.� The scientist with the needlestick completed quarantine without showing symptoms or becoming ill. But even if a high-risk incident occurred with a more dangerous strain, UW officials told the NIH, the lab worker would still be quarantined at home. Could an accident have caused COVID-19?: Why the Wuhan lab-leak theory shouldn't be dismissed 'I remember it very well': Dr. Fauci describes a secret 2020 meeting to talk about COVID origins It was a stunning change by the university to a critical safeguard that federal officials thought was in place for the Kawaoka lab� research. The NIH demanded the university find a dedicated quarantine facility outside of workers�esidences, such as a hospital isolation room, or face the suspension or termination of its grant funding, correspondence shows. The university didn� want to use the UW Hospital as a quarantine site. Their concerns included that researchers might be unwilling to come forward about potential exposures if they faced being confined in hospital isolation rooms. The university and its medical team also worried about the increased potential for the public to learn about its lab accidents, noting in correspondence that �t would be much harder to control the spread of information and as a result there would be a higher probability of incorrect information being told to (the) general public and potentially members of the media.� The university eventually agreed to NIH� demands. And on Dec. 24, 2013, the NIH gave its approval for Kawaoka� lab to resume its research manipulating H5N1 virus strains that were transmissible to mammals. Safety concerns led to US pause on 'gain of function' studies By 2014, there was a growing discomfort at the highest levels of the U.S. government about the risk of an accident with an engineered virus. Wisconsin� needlestick incident, which drew questions within NIH but wasn� publicly known, was soon followed by a series of high-profile accidents at federal labs in 2014 �rom safety breaches with anthrax and avian influenza at the CDC to the discovery of forgotten vials of smallpox that had been kept for decades in a storage room on the NIH Existing text... campus. In October 2014, citing these federal lab incidents, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced a moratorium on new federal funding for certain gain-of-function research while the risks and benefits of the controversial experiments were studied. The funding pause remained in place for three years until it was finally lifted in December 2017. But it was only in 2019 that some of the halted experiments were quietly allowed to begin again under a revised federal oversight process, which was criticized for keeping secret the details of the new experiments and the basis for the government approvals. The Kawaoka lab was one of the first to receive approval and NIH funding. Not long after the Kawaoka lab was greenlighted in 2019 to resume work with its infamous lab-created H5N1 influenza virus �he one that had helped spark the worldwide debate over gain-of-function research �here was an accident. And in the days and weeks that followed, efforts were made to downplay the significance of the event, avoid notifying public health officials and oversight bodies, and keep the public and policymakers in the dark. A lot was at stake. Not only would the incident draw attention to safety issues at the UW lab, but it also would raise larger questions about the rigor and effectiveness of how the U.S. government was overseeing the riskiest experiments in which scientists are creating enhanced pathogens with pandemic potential. Scientist's air hose detached in lab while working with engineered virus When the accident happened on Dec. 9, 2019, Kawaoka� three scientists were working in an enhanced biosafety level 3 agriculture lab suite at the University of Wisconsin� Influenza Research Institute. This facility had been built specifically for Kawaoka� research and featured labs with negative air pressure, watertight and airtight seals, double HEPA-filtered exhaust air and redundant air handling systems. The experiment they were performing involved a virus whose name describes the components of its engineering: VN1203HA(N158D/N224K/ Q226L/T318I)/CA04. It was the virus described in Kawaoka� controversial H5N1 gain-of-function experiments that had been published nearly eight years earlier, the NIH would later confirm in written responses to my questions. It was the virus that had gained the concerning ability to spread between ferrets and had raised fears it could do this among humans. On that December day, two experienced researchers from Kawaoka� team were helping train a colleague as they collected samples from ferrets. The animals were part of a transmission experiment and had been in contact with other ferrets infected with this engineered H5N1 virus or another wild-type flu strain. The three scientists wore several layers of personal protection equipment. One of their most important pieces of personal protective equipment was the air-purifying respirator that each wore to ensure they didn� breathe any air from inside the laboratory. Even though they were using a biosafety cabinet, there was always the potential for virus to be present in the room� air. These kinds of high-tech respirators encase workers�eads in a protective hood with a clear face-plate. A blower attached to a belt delivers purified air through what looks like a vacuum cleaner hose that runs up the scientist� back and attaches to the hood behind their head. Labs are responsible for training workers how to properly assemble and use this kind of equipment. As one of the senior researchers prepared to start collecting samples from the next round of ferrets, the trainee realized there was a problem with their respirator. The powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) hose had somehow disconnected from the unit that supplied safe, filtered air. Instead, the detached hose dangled loose in the lab� potentially contaminated air. The hose was �mmediately�econnected, Wisconsin officials later said, and one of the experienced researchers radioed out to the lab� operations manager as the trainee began the process of exiting the lab, incident records show. The trainee was initially told to follow the lab� quarantine procedure to keep them spreading the virus if they were infected. The university would later say this was done �ut of an abundance of caution.�ut at some point, a lab compliance official released the worker from quarantine. It is unclear whether this quarantine release happened within minutes, hours or days of the incident. Nor is it clear whether university officials first consulted with any public health and oversight agencies. Kawaoka and university officials wouldn� agree to be interviewed and provided little information in response to my questions. State and local health officials weren't notified about lab accident If there were ever a virus requiring that everyone follow safety and incident reporting rules, this was it. The system of oversight in place that day had been created in response to the international furor over this very virus. Yet, after the trainee� respirator hose disconnected in December 2019, the university didn� notify local or state public health officials about the incident or consult with them before discontinuing the trainee� quarantine, despite representations going back years indicating this would occur following �ny potential exposure.� The university says it didn� need to notify them. That� because UW officials, in consultation with the university� health experts, made their own determination that no potential exposure had occurred. Officials at Public Health Madison & Dane County, the local health department, told me they defer to the university� judgment and expertise when it comes to lab safety issues. The department said it �oes not need to be notified of something that was determined to not be a significant exposure. It is also not incumbent on us to further evaluate whether there was a significant exposure, if UW reports that there was not.� The university also didn� immediately alert other key oversight entities that the public relies upon to ensure the safety of this kind of particularly risky research. UW officials waited two months �ntil Feb. 10, 2020 �o file a report that should have been made immediately to the NIH Office of Science Policy, which oversees U.S. research with genetically manipulated organisms like the engineered H5N1 influenza virus involved in the experiment. Records show the university� internal biosafety committee, which had approved the Kawaoka lab� research, wasn� �pprised�f the Dec. 9, 2019, incident until Feb. 5, 2020. The university was less slow in reporting the incident to the federal funding officials at NIH� National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which provided the grant for the controversial experiments. But UW still waited 10 days �ntil Dec. 19, 2019 �o report the incident to NIAID program staff, according to information provided to me in writing by NIH officials. The grant� terms required immediate notification in the event of an �llness or exposure.�t was UW� contention, however, that �either of the two criteria were met�ecause there was �o reasonable risk of virus exposure,�IH officials told me. When the university eventually notified grant officials, it said it was doing so �n the spirit of transparency and responsible conduct of research,�he NIH said. UW officials, who for months wouldn� answer many of my questions about the incident, eventually said that Kawaoka �nformed his program officer at NIH in early December,�efore following up with an incident summary on Dec. 19.

Download it for free from your app store. As I pressed NIH to reconcile the agency� statement with UW� account, a few more details emerged. NIH said that the first time UW contacted anyone at the agency was on Dec. 12, 2019 �hree days after the incident. That� when UW first requested a phone call from an NIAID program officer. A first discussion about the incident happened on Dec. 13, and on Dec. 16, during a follow-up discussion, NIAID staff asked UW to send in a written description of the incident. Both NIAID Director Anthony Fauci and NIAID Principal Deputy Director Hugh Auchincloss �ere briefed about the incident,�he NIH said in a written response to my questions. But NIH would not tell me when Fauci and Auchincloss were briefed or whether they provided guidance on how the UW incident should be handled. UW officials said Kawaoka� lab immediately reported the incident to the CDC� select agent lab regulators. But the university didn� answer my questions about why the incident was immediately reported to the CDC �nd not NIH �iven UW� stated position that there wasn� any potential exposure. It is unclear whether Kawaoka� team consulted the CDC in advance of the university� decision to release the researcher from quarantine. CDC officials �ncluding Dr. Samuel Edwin, who heads the select agent program �idn� answer my questions about this. University notified federal oversight team 2 months after lab accident When the university finally notified the NIH Office of Science Policy about the ferret incident �wo months after it happened �W officials unsuccessfully tried to justify their significant delay by saying the incident was �ot reportable �ecause even though the trainee� PAPR tube had detached, in their view there was �o potential exposure.� The university� justifications, records show, included that the ferrets had been handled inside a biosafety cabinet and that the contact ferrets had been exposed to infected ferrets for only about 24 hours �nd were not shedding virus yet.� The university also told NIH officials that �he air the observer would have breathed during the few seconds the hose was disconnected would have come from inside the PAPR hood, which would have been HEPA- filtered before the hose disconnected.� The lab� report to the NIH doesn� say how they determined this. The reason UW finally told the NIH oversight office about the incident was because lab regulators at the Federal Select Agent Program �s well as the NIH office that funded the research ��ecommended�t be reported. The report UW finally submitted to the NIH Office of Science Policy includes the following notation: �Confidential �o not release this information without written authorization of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.� What were the consequences of UW� delayed reporting of the incident? The NIH Office of Science Policy told me it �eminded the institution about its reporting responsibilities,�nd �oted that it should have been immediately reported to OSP.� If NIH delivered that message, UW officials say they never heard it. �his is certainly the kind of information we would have remembered or recorded in notes taken at the time,� UW spokesperson said by email. UW repeatedly pointed to a short email from an NIH analyst thanking the university for its Feb. 10, 2020, report and adding that �he actions taken in response to this incident appear appropriate.�IH says this email referred only to UW� �iosafety actions,�ot to the university� failure to file an immediate report. In the end, the trainee apparently didn� become infected. But how the university and the lab oversight system handled the incident should be cause for concern. �t is all too easy to sensationalize this research, to misconstrue events, and misrepresent the nature of incidents rightfully reported by institutions to regulatory agencies,�aid Kelly Tyrrell, UW� director of media relations, in a email that spoke in broad brushstrokes about the importance of research, the humanity of researchers, and how sometimes there can be differences in interpretations of incident reporting requirements and about regulations. Tyrrell said that UW takes safety seriously, and that the Kawaoka lab has never had an incident where public health or safety have been put at risk. �here are few people in the world trained to understand the nature of the pathogens involved, the biosafety and biosecurity measures in place and the protocols developed and followed,�yrrell continued. �ost people are also not equipped to appropriately evaluate the risk. It is unfortunate that some seek to capitalize on this knowledge gap.� Alison Young is an investigative reporter in Washington, D.C., and serves as the Curtis B.

{"id": "294", "title": "Bird flu: Scientists find mutations, say threat is still low", "date": "2023-04-14", "fulltext": "NEW YORK (AP) � man in Chile is infected with a bird flu that has concerning mutations, but the threat to people from the virus remains low, U.S. health officials said Friday. Past animal studies suggest these mutations could cause the virus to be more harmful or spread more easily, health officials said. But they also said there is no evidence that the mutations would make it easier for it to take root in a person� upper lungs � development that would raise concerns about spread among people. The mutations do not change public health officials�ssessment of the overall risk to people from the H5N1 virus, which \"continues to be low,�aid Vivien Dugan of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The mutations, which have appeared only in the one hospitalized patient, may have occurred after the man got sick, CDC officials said. There� no evidence that the mutated virus spread to other people, mixed with other flu viruses, or developed the ability to fight off current medicines or evade vaccines, agency officials said. Such genetic changes have been seen in past bird flu infections. �evertheless, it� important to continue to look carefully at every instance of human infection,\" Dugan said. \"We need to remain vigilant for changes that would make these viruses more dangerous to people.� This type of flu, called Type A H5N1, was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, when visitors to live poultry markets caught it. Sporadic outbreaks have followed, and more than 450 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of infected people got it directly from birds. As bird flu hits other species, however, scientists fear the virus could evolve to spread more easily among people. And it has been spreading widely, to birds and animals in scores of countries. In the U.S., it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks across the country. Since the beginning of last year, tens of millions of chickens have died of the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading, one of the reasons cited for soaring U.S. egg prices. The new lab analysis looked at the virus found in the lungs of a 53-year-old man living in Chile� Antofagasta region. It may be that he became infected through contact with sick or dead birds or infected sea lions, according to a WHO summary of the case. The man was healthy and had not traveled recently. On March 13, he started getting a cough, sore throat and hoarseness, the WHO said. His symptoms worsened and he eventually was sent to an intensive care unit and treated with antiviral medicines and antibiotics. He is still hospitalized and being monitored, CDC officials said. Genetic sequencing this week revealed the two concerning mutations. Chilean and American health officials have been working together on the investigation. Andrew Pekosz, a flu researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said he hasn't seen the preliminary analysis of the Chilean patient's infection. �hen these viruses get into humans, there's a likelihood that they start to adapt to grow better in us,�nd this is a sign that is happening, he said. There are three or four kinds of mutations that would need to be seen in a H5N1 virus �efore that would really raise the alarm signal that something is happening of concern,�e added. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute� Science and Educational Media Group.

{"id": "301", "title": "Biden administration is testing four vaccines in hopes of fighting avian flu", "date": "2023-05-03", "fulltext": "Agriculture officials in the Biden administration are testing four vaccines in hopes of stanching the latest outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza that has devastated U.S. poultry farms and driven up egg prices, with plans to launch a national vaccination campaign that would be the first-ever effort of its kind. Two of the vaccines being tested by the U.S. Department of Agriculture were developed by that agency. The others, from animal drugmaker Zoetis and Merck Animal Health, were developed during the last large-scale outbreak in 2015 and not used, a USDA spokesman said. Should the trials be successful, the next stage is identifying manufacturers, with many more steps before laying hens, domesticated turkeys and broilers are vaccinated. In a best-case scenario, the agency estimates an 18- to 24-month timeline before having a commercial quantity of vaccine available that matches the currently circulating virus strain, but the timeline could be expedited in an emergency. Although there is little concern that the virus, known as H5N1 avian flu, could spark a human pandemic, it has become a major headache for the world's poultry farmers. This has been the largest and most deadly outbreak ever. Nearly 60 million farm-raised birds in the United States have died or been killed to stop the virus's spread. The virus has also contributed to sky-high egg prices. But while \"eggflation\" has calmed temporarily, bird flu has not flown the coop. Historically, avian flu outbreaks have come and gone. The virus went undetected in the United States for several years but reemerged in 2022 and has been present in North America ever since. But what is often a seasonal problem, peaking in spring and summer months with the movement of wild migratory birds, now seems not to be going away. Experts say there are indications that the current aggressive strain may have become permanent in North America, part of a new normal to which the poultry industry must adapt. \"The virus really spread from the Atlantic Coast westward across the U.S. and is now being detected in all 50 states, including Alaska,\" Nichola Hill, a professor in the biology department at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, said in a briefing last week. \"So, we've seen continuous circulation in North America since that time, and it's raised the question of whether this virus is now endemic.\" Despite efforts to contain the virus, it has continued to spread among bird species and recently jumped to mammals. There have been no documented cases of human-to-human transmission, and people known to have been sickened worked closely with poultry. But it poses dangers for pets and means more uncertainty ahead for the cost of eggs. Egg prices fell by almost 11 percent last month, according to government data. Seth Meyer, chief economist for the USDA, optimistically predicted in February that wholesale egg prices would fall even further and total egg production would increase this year. But this prediction assumes there will not be continued avian flu outbreaks. And this, say many veterinarians and poultry experts, is wishful thinking. Egg prices overall had been trending upward in the United States since the current strain of avian flu struck, increasing by 155 percent between the beginning of 2022 and the start of this year. Eggs became the go-to example as food prices rose more broadly, surging to $4.25 per dozen in December, which put pressure on Americans' pocketbooks and drove up the costs of foods that contained eggs. Some people frustrated with the spiraling prices went so far as to decorate potatoes this Easter. (The Potatoes USA promotion board nudged that idea along.) Analysts at Rabobank, a financial services provider, predict egg prices will remain elevated globally, with even higher prices in countries where strong avian flu pressures persist. Persistently high prices and scarcity could pose a particular challenge for low-income consumers because eggs are an important staple food, high in protein and nutrients. More than 254 million birds have died of it or been depopulated worldwide, said David Swayne, a poultry veterinarian who specializes in avian flu, on a recent call with reporters. It is now considered a \"panzootic,\" meaning a pandemic in wild animals: Last month, 3,500 sea lions succumbed to it in Peru, according to Peru's national parks service. Scientists have detected the virus in more than 100 species of wild birds, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have documented infections in bears, foxes, skunks, farmed mink and zoo animals such as tigers and leopards. Earlier this month, avian flu was linked to the deaths of three pet cats in Nebraska. \"This happens when our pets are predating on dead birds,\" Hill said. \"We knew that this moment would arrive when pets would be affected. If you're walking a dog, keep it on a leash to keep it away from wildlife, and keep cats indoors.\" Hill said the transmission to mammals may be happening via waterborne transmission, meaning mammals such as whales and seals are getting it from a virus in the water, which can lead to mass mortality events. Or transmission is happening when animals such as foxes feed on dead, infected birds such as ducks. The USDA said its Agricultural Research Service began avian influenza vaccination trials in April. They expect data on the efficacy of a single-dose vaccine in May and the results of a two-dose vaccine challenge in June. Widespread vaccination could be expensive and logistically complicated, said Yuko Sato, a veterinary professor at Iowa State University. As with the coronavirus, it's a virus that keeps changing, so a vaccine that worked on an earlier version of the virus might not do the job long-term. \"You'd want to give one shot and then a second shot two weeks later, but there are 300 million laying hens,\" said Sato, adding that there are also 9.6 billion broilers raised for the meat industry. An effort of that magnitude would have significant costs that would be passed on to consumers' grocery bills. Also, Sato said, once birds are vaccinated, they may not show symptoms of the virus even when infected, so it might make detection much harder. \"Vaccines are not a silver bullet and won't prevent infection,\" she said. Because of this, some experts worry that widespread vaccination could hurt poultry exports, making it harder for chicken farmers to prove to trading partners that animals are free from disease. (In the last big bird flu outbreak, in 2015, U.S. chicken exports dropped by $1.1 billion, according to USDA data.) The National Chicken Council, the trade association of meat chickens, does not support the use of a vaccine, said Tom Super, senior vice president of communications for the council. He said most countries, including the United States, won't import vaccinated poultry due to concerns that vaccines can mask the presence of the disease. \"The vaccine will not eliminate the virus,\" he said. \"Birds can still get [the virus] and may not show signs.\" Carol Cardona, Pomeroy chair in avian health at the University of Minnesota, said vaccination would make it more possible to predict and to protect domesticated birds. She warned that not vaccinating could also carry costs and that some animals, such as turkeys, are naturally more vulnerable to the virus. \"Not being reactive is half the battle,\" she said. \"That's why we have to do vaccination. Why would you not? We have the science. It will take a while, and that means we need to start sooner rather than later.\" Sato said that in the last outbreak, in 2015, much of the spread was from farm to farm, truck tires and dirty boots dragging the virus with them. Heightened biosecurity measures, such as quarantining animals and limiting visitors to facilities, have minimized this, but still, if just a few birds test positive for H5N1, the whole flock is killed and disposed of to minimize spread - which increases costs associated with raising replacement birds, but also for protective gear for workers who must deal with infected animals. According to Swayne, there have been 874 human cases of avian flu since 1997, about 40 percent fatal. Most of the humans who have contracted avian flu since 1997 have been people who worked with poultry or who have been in \"wet\" markets where animals are slaughtered. \"Poultry workers are at risk when birds are dying,\" Cardona said, but added that she would not rule out a more significant outbreak in humans. \"Is it likely in this country?

{"id": "308", "title": "Bird flu could become the next human pandemic �nd politicians aren� paying attention", "date": "2023-05-16", "fulltext": "We have the tools to prepare, but post-Covid fatigue and a lack of political will mean they aren� being used Last month a pet dog in Canada died of H5N1, also known as bird flu, after eating a wild goose. Worryingly this follows a pattern, with an increasing number of bird flu cases appearing in mammals who come into contact with an infected bird, dead or alive. When you see a wild bird such as a duck or seagull, think bird flu. Because it� actually more likely than not they�e infected with the virus. And many species of wild birds are asymptomatic, meaning that they don� show any symptoms. The risk of transmission to pets is low, but they can get sick from chewing or eating an infected bird, whether it� dead or alive. I first wrote about bird flu in November, when domestic birds in Britain were put into an indoor lockdown. The virus had become endemic in most wild bird populations. It� incredibly infectious, where one bird could infect as many as 100 others. When infected wild birds encountered domestic birds (such as by flying over and defecating on them underneath), huge problems emerged. Avian flu has a near 100% fatality rate in most poultry, which led to shortages of not only turkey for Christmas but also eggs, as farm after farm was decimated by the disease. Since November, the signals emerging across the world continue to be worrying. In January and February this year, more than 3,000 sea lions died of bird flu in Peru (where the death toll in wild birds reached an estimated 50,000). In Russia, 700 Caspian seals died. Then several dolphins in Britain and the US died of H5N1. Normally, even if an animal catches H5N1 from a bird, it can� pass it to other mammals. This limits its spread. But the large number of cases in these outbreaks suggest the possibility of mammal-to-mammal transmission, although this hasn� been confirmed yet by genetic sequencing. A more likely hypothesis is that these outbreaks are groups of animals feeding on infected birds. It is not yet 100% clear what� happening. But the risk of spread among mammals is ever-present. A new research pre-print from Canada showed that H5N1 samples could spread efficiently between ferrets with fatal outcomes. In order to spread efficiently to humans, H5 would need three major categories of genetic changes, according to bird flu expert Prof Richard Webby. So far, the virus has been able to make one of these changes, but not the other two. So right now, H5N1 is a theoretical risk for the next human pandemic, rather than one requiring urgency in response today. And a prime minister or health secretary might say, �hy prepare for something that might never happen?� To those of us scientists working in global health, there are enough concerning signals that action should already be happening. So that if a certain set of mutations do occur and we see an outbreak in humans in Peru or China or Britain, that the harm it could cause is minimal. This is a disease with an estimated 50-60% fatality rate in humans, including children. The cornerstone of infectious disease preparedness is in: surveillance (to know what strain is spreading and where in birds); testing (to identify disease quickly in humans); vaccines (for protection against disease and death); and antivirals (to improve clinical outcomes). The US government is already moving in this direction. Rebecca Katz, professor at Georgetown University Medical Center, has noted that a H5 candidate vaccine virus recently produced by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is likely to provide good protection against the circulating H5N1 viruses. The information has been shared with vaccine manufacturers to start the process of stockpiling adequate doses. But this is a challenge because most influenza vaccines are created by incubating doses in chicken eggs (called egg-based production). If bird flu has killed off many of the chickens, then egg shortages are likely. There� another H5N1 vaccine which is non-egg based, but they could have a maximum of 150m doses ready within six months. The world� population is almost 8 billion. In addition, the FDA-approved antiviral treatments for seasonal influenza could also work against bird flu. But again, getting doses to all parts of the world is a challenge given shortages. Preparation must also involve appropriate PPE for healthcare workers to protect against a respiratory disease (flu) and diagnostics to quickly identify if someone is infectious in hospitals. All of these issues are solvable with precise planning, collaboration across countries, scientific ingenuity and good leadership. With post Covid-19 fatigue, the bigger problem is bringing the public along and communicating the facts so that they are trusted and believed. With so much �ften understandable �istrust in our current political leadership, authorities like chief medical officers and independent government advisers become crucial. At the moment most governments aren� paying attention to bird flu: they�e more interested in another AI (artificial intelligence) rather than this AI (avian influenza), but the avian influenza threat is real, and needs much more immediate attention and preparation. * Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article mentions an estimated 50-60% fatality rate in humans but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.", "spread_risk": "yes", "spread_feedback": "AFFIRMS RISK: 2, 4, 5 + 'But the large number of cases in these outbreaks suggest the possibility of mammal-to-mammal transmission, although this hasn’t been confirmed yet by genetic sequencing.'; 'So far, the virus has been able to make one of these changes, but not the other two.

The gene is present in all humans and can be found in the lungs and upper respiratory tract, where flu viruses replicate. It was already known to scientists, but the gene� antiviral abilities are a new discovery. A six-year investigative study led by the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research found that the BTN3A3 gene is a powerful barrier against most avian flu viruses. Although relatively rare, some avian flu virus strains have periodically spilled over into humans. Two of the most recent H5N1 cases were reported in UK poultry farm workers in May this year. Human cases of H5N1 bird flu were first found in Hong Kong in 1997. Globally since 2003, 873 human H5N1 infections have been reported to the World Health Organization. Of those, 458 people died. The study found that some bird and swine flu viruses have a genetic mutation that allows them to escape the blocking effects of the BTN3A3 gene and infect people. By tracking the history of human influenza pandemics and linking resistance to the gene with key virus types, the researchers concluded that all human influenza pandemics, including the 1918 Spanish flu and the 2009 swine flu pandemics, were a result of BTN3A3-resistant strains. The findings suggest that resistance to the gene could help determine whether flu strains have human pandemic potential or not. That may lead to testing of wild birds, poultry and other animals susceptible to flu viruses such as pigs, for BTN3A3-resistant viruses. �he antiviral functions of the [BTN3A3] gene appeared 40m years ago in primates,�aid Prof Massimo Palmarini who led the study and is director of Glasgow� virology research centre. �nderstanding the barriers that block avian flu in humans means better targeted solutions and better control measures to prevent the spillovers. He said that if a gene-resistant virus was identified, �e can direct preventative measures to those viruses, sooner, to prevent the spillover [into humans]� Dr Rute Maria Pinto, the study� lead author, said: �t� pretty amazing, isn� it? We are all fairly proud about the outcome. This gene had been identified before, and other functions were attributed to it, but we found that the gene is antiviral against avian flu. No one had found that before.� She said the discovery was expected to have immediate practical applications. �ow, when we find cases of bird flu, we can basically swab sick birds, carcasses or faeces and find out whether the virus can overcome the BTN3A3 gene, simply by looking at its sequence and determining if this virus is more or less likely to jump into humans. If the virus can in fact overcome BTN3A3 then stricter measurements should be put in place to prevent spillovers.� Pinto added: �s a scientist we are expected to find solutions to problems, to give back to the taxpayers that fund this [research], and to find something that can be used straight away is really impactful.� The study was also able to retrospectively identify increases in gene-resistant viruses ahead of previous human spillovers. Before the H7N9 bird flu virus outbreak, which first infected humans in China in 2013, the study found �n increased frequency of the BTN3A3-resistant genotype [in birds] in 2011-2012� To date there have been almost 1,570 cases of H7N9 and at least 616 deaths. � guess what these observations provide is a snapshot of what the frequency of the BTN3A3 resistant gene was at different period of times in the birds,�almarini said. �ecause birds haven� got BTN3A3, there is no evolutionary pressure to keep, or not, those traits.� He said certain mutations �ight make the virus more or less fitter in the birds�ut this had not yet been studied. Similarly, before the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, the study found H1N1 gene resistance in pigs occurring between 2002 and 2006.

{"id": "348", "title": "Centre of deadly bird flu outbreaks shifts from Asia to Europe and Africa", "date": "2023-10-19", "fulltext": "Increase of virus in wild birds is driving evolution and spread of new strains, researchers found The epicentre of deadly bird flu outbreaks has shifted from Asia to Europe and Africa, a new study has found. For 25 years, bird flu viruses typically emerged from Asia, but major changes in the virus and its spread among wild birds mean the outbreaks are shifting. Research shows that while outbreaks in 2016 and 2017 started in China, two new H5 viruses emerged in 2020 in African poultry and in 2022 in European wild birds. �hese results highlight a shift in the HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5 epicentre beyond Asia,�esearchers write in the paper published in Nature. The latest outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1 caused Europe� worst bird flu outbreak, before spreading globally. It has now reached every continent except Oceania and Antarctica, killing record numbers of domestic and wild birds, and even jumping into mammals. It can also jump to humans: since 2003, H5N1 was found in 873 humans, resulting in 458 deaths, according to the World Heath Organization. Most cases were linked to the handling of infected poultry, and it is not known to be able to transmit from human to human. An international team of scientists led by the University of Hong Kong analysed outbreaks between 2005 and 2022, collecting data on confirmed cases from the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health. They also studied 10,000 sets of viral DNA. Despite the number of outbreaks, only 0.2% of cases were sequenced, researchers said, and urged countries to increase surveillance to understand how the virus is changing. Monitoring infrastructure is particularly weak in Africa, they said. The authors suggest the increasing persistence of avian flu in wild birds is driving the evolution and spread of new strains. Bird flu is highly infectious, with scientists saying one bird can infect as many as 100, with the virus present in faeces, mucus, blood and saliva. UK government authorities say more than 99% of cases in poultry in the UK have come from wild birds. Mass culling used to be an effective policy to control the disease� spread in poultry, but because avian flu is now so widespread in wild bird populations, this is proving less effective. The spread of bird flu within the poultry industry is determined by human activity and how birds are traded. In wild birds, migratory flyways are key indicators of where the disease will spread, with key migration routes along the east Atlantic and Pacific flyways, meaning it has been able to spread to new areas that have never been exposed to it before. Working out how many wild birds have died is difficult because so many carcasses are never found or counted, but researchers say it will be in the millions.

The case marks the second known instance that a person in the U.S. has been infected with H5N1 bird flu. The person reported eye redness, or conjunctivitis, as their only symptom and is being treated with an antiviral drug. The human health risk of the bird flu remains low for the U.S. general public, the CDC said, but people with close, prolonged exposures to infected animals or their environments are at higher risk. \"At this point, there's nothing that suggests that there is any serious risk of a larger human outbreak,\" said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"I'm trying to understand why the cows are getting infected. That's a really important scientific question right now.\" The previous human case was reported in Colorado in 2022, in a person with direct contact with poultry. Human infections are rare, but the agency said it has been monitoring for infections among people exposed to infected birds after reported outbreaks in U.S. poultry and wild birds began in late 2021. Human illnesses with the virus typically have occurred through exposure to infected poultry or wild birds. Sick birds can shed the virus in their saliva, mucus and feces, and humans can become infected when enough virus gets into their eyes, nose or mouth. Infections have also been reported in other animals including foxes, bears, seals, minks, cats and dogs. The disease in humans ranges from mild infections, which include upper-respiratory and eye-related symptoms, to severe pneumonia. Since 1997, some 890 human cases have been reported across the globe, with a case-fatality rate of roughly 50%, the CDC said. \"It's still a very uncommon illness in humans,\" Inglesby said. \"It is a very serious infection, but it's possible there are cases that are occurring that we're not detecting that are much milder.\" The U.S. Agriculture Department reported the avian influenza in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas in late March this year. Unpasteurized milk from sick cattle at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, as well as a throat swab from a cow in Texas, tested positive for the same strain of the virus that is currently widespread among birds. A few days later, the virus was also confirmed among a Michigan dairy herd that had recently added cows from Texas. This is the first time the H5N1 influenza virus has been detected in cattle in the U.S., according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. There was little or no mortality among affected dairy herds, Agriculture Department officials said. Bird flu has historically been a problem for the poultry industry in the U.S. The current outbreak is the deadliest on record for the U.S. agricultural industry, and has led to the death of tens of millions of chickens, turkeys and other birds since early 2022. Industry officials have attributed the disease's rapid spread to wild birds carrying it to farms during the birds' migration. The disease is usually fatal in chickens that contract it, the CDC has said, and is contagious enough that wild-bird droppings blown on the wind near barn vents can trigger an outbreak. To curb further spread, poultry farms often destroy entire flocks after a single case is detected. People should avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals as well as raw milk, feces or other contaminated materials, the CDC said. People also shouldn't prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food, including raw milk, from animals with a confirmed or suspected infection, the agency said. \"For the vast majority of people, this isn't going to affect them,\" said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health. \"Who it will affect are people who have close contact with animals or economic interest in animals.\" There are no concerns with the safety of the commercial milk supply right now because products on store shelves are pasteurized, according to the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration. Dairies must send milk from only healthy animals to processing, and milk must be pasteurized for it to enter interstate commerce for human consumption. Milk from infected animals is being diverted or destroyed, the CDC said. �acob Bunge contributed to this article.

Texas health officials reported Monday that an individual who had been in contact with cattle has contracted H5N1 avian flu, only the second case ever recorded in the U.S. The person had contact with dairy cattle that are believed to have been infected with the virus, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement. It went on to say that the individual’s only symptom is eye inflammation infection of the conjunctiva, the tissue surrounding the eye. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the infected individual is doing well and is being treated with the influenza antiviral oseltamivir, sold as Tamiflu. The individual was instructed to isolate to reduce the risk of infecting others, and to date there’s no indication of onward spread, Shah said. Related: Tracking the bird flu, experts see a familiar threat and a virus whose course is hard to predict “We are not aware of reports that any of this individual’s close contacts have developed any symptoms,” he told STAT. The person was tested late last week, with confirmatory testing taking place at the CDC over the weekend. The CDC is not currently running any other confirmatory H5 tests, Shah said. “The fact that there are not other samples cooking right now is reassuring, insofar as that we’re not aware of other individuals who are symptomatic following an exposure to livestock,” he added. “We are still out there looking, to be very clear,” he said. “Our antennae are up and we have been working with state public health officials in a number of jurisdictions to look for individuals who report signs and symptoms of illness, to make sure they know how to get tested.” NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy Three states Texas, Kansas, and Michigan have recently reported they have had confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in cattle; New Mexico and Idaho have also reported outbreaks in cattle that are presumed to have been caused by H5N1. The virus doesn’t kill the cattle, but milk production is lowered and the animals’ feeding is reduced. Owners of implicated herds have been told to destroy milk produced by infected cattle, though if milk from infected animals made its way into the food chain, pasteurization could kill the virus, the CDC statement said. Up until now, cows have not been on the ever-lengthening list of animals that have been known to be susceptible to this virus. Infections of the highly pathogenic bird flu a term that describes how it behaves in poultry have been detected in many other mammals, though, including big cats, bears, foxes, skunks, sea lions, and seals. Despite the alarming increase in the past few years of the virus’s geographic range and the number of species it has been seen to infect, both the World Health Organization and the CDC currently assess its risk to people as low. The news of the case in Texas does not change that, Shah said. Trending Now: This AI company scans penis pictures for STIs. Its unproven tech is in an FDA gray zone H5N1 bird flu has been high on the worry list of experts on emerging diseases for the past two decades. Over that time there have been nearly 900 human infections in 23 countries; just over half of those infections have been fatal. But in recent years the strain of the virus circulating in many parts of the world including the United States seems to trigger human infections less frequently than earlier versions of the virus did. And when human cases caused by this strain occur, they are typically mild. A case in point was the country’s first H5 infection, which occurred in 2022. A man who was involved in culling infected poultry in Colorado reported feeling fatigued; he tested positive for the virus. It was unclear if he was actually even infected or simply had viruses in his nose that were picked up by a nasal swab test. The low rate of human infections and the mildness of most cases when they occur has counterbalanced concern about the virus’s astonishing spread. But people who have studied influenza and this virus in particular for years do not know what to make of its movement into so many different animal species. Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., called the infections in cows “a head scratcher,” saying he would not have figured cattle to be on the list of animals susceptible to this virus. “​​This particular version of H5 is teaching us a number of things we thought we knew weren’t right,” Webby said. He termed the news of the Texas case “not unexpected, but always a concern.” Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, said the move into cows expands the virus’ range, “but I’m not sure what it portends for humans and swine.” Osterholm said he would be more concerned if there were word that the virus had been found to be infecting pigs. Pigs can be infected with human and avian flu viruses and co-infection of more than one type of virus in pigs can produce reassortants hybrid viruses that might be more able to infect people. As of now, he believes the risk H5N1 poses is not changed by the infection of cattle. “This all could change in a heartbeat with additional mutations.

While officials have so far said the possibility of cow-to-cow transmission �annot be ruled out,� think we can go further than that.

{"id": "411", "title": "Bird flu detected in dairy worker", "date": "2024-04-02", "fulltext": "A dairy worker in Texas is being treated for bird flu, only the second human case in the United States of an illness caused by a highly virulent virus that has recently rampaged through dairy cows in five states, federal and state officials said Monday. The patient, who experienced eye inflammation as the only symptom, was tested for flu late last week, with confirmatory testing performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the weekend. The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu. The newly emerged case does not change the risk for the general public, which remains low, federal officials said. \"The patient worked directly with sick cows at a dairy, so the virus was most likely transmitted through that close contact,\" said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. The case has alarmed disease trackers monitoring for the worst-case scenario: human-to-human transmission of the pathogen, which has happened infrequently worldwide, typically among family members engaged in work with animals. And it raises questions about whether this pathogen is now more easily transmitted among mammals. Texas health officials are working with other state and federal agencies to provide guidance to dairies about precautions workers should take to minimize the risk of transmission from animals and encourage those who become ill to get tested, Van Deusen said. CDC spokesman Kevin Griffis said the investigation into how widely the virus has spread is ongoing. \"At this time, we are not aware that any of the individual's close contacts have experienced any symptoms,\" he said. Officials do not yet know the specific route of transmission. While the CDC considers the risk of infection for the general public to be low, people with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection. Still, any time the virus changes \"that makes me sit up and take notice,\" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Its recent emergence in cattle and the likelihood of cow-to-cow transmission represents a worrisome change. This marks the first time the highly pathogenic avian influenza has been identified in U.S. dairy cattle, the American Veterinary Medical Association said in a statement last week. Matt Steele, chief executive of the Kansas Cattlemen's Association, said beef and dairy producers constantly check the health of their animals. If an animal appears sick, they'll pull it aside, take its temperature and call in a veterinarian, if needed. The odds of infected meat or dairy products leaving the farm are \"very, very low,\" Steele said, citing a system of checks and balances between the producers and state and federal agencies. \"This isn't really a major disease outbreak\" that would heavily impact the meat and dairy market, he said. Human infections with avian influenza viruses are uncommon but have occurred sporadically worldwide. The CDC has been monitoring for illness among people exposed to H5 virusinfected birds since outbreaks were first detected in U.S. wild birds and poultry in 2021. Until now, only one human case had been identified in the United States. In 2022, a person in Colorado tested positive for the same strain of avian flu. The person was involved in culling poultry presumed to have been infected with H5N1 bird flu. The person reported fatigue for a few days as their only symptom and recovered, according to the CDC. Human illnesses with H5N1 bird flu have ranged from mild, such as eye infections and upper respiratory symptoms, to severe illness, such as pneumonia, that have resulted in death in other countries. Experts worry about the potential for viral evolution. There are several scenarios: The virus could remain primarily a threat to animal health and then recede, as it has in the past. It may continue to circulate among animals, but not routinely infect humans. Or, in the worst case, it evolves to spread easily between people and becomes the next pandemic, Rivers said. Such a pandemic would have significant costs to human life, society and the global economy, she said. Pandemic flu has long been the boogeyman of infectious-disease and public health experts because the influenza virus is known to be wily, constantly changing, with an ability to combine with other influenza viruses to form new subtypes. A pandemic flu occurs when a new strain of influenza emerges that can be transmitted easily from person to person, and for which there is little or no natural immunity. The more the virus is able to circulate in mammalian species, the greater the opportunity for the pathogen to mutate to spread more efficiently between humans. Although the H5N1 bird flu has rarely infected humans, among the cases that have been diagnosed, the fatality rate is roughly 50 percent. Rivers said it's important for U.S. policymakers to be proactive. If this strain of bird flu becomes easily spread from human to human, \"the opportunity we have to make a difference is very short,\" she said, because there is no immunity in humans and transmission would be fast. \"You can't adopt a wait-and-see attitude.\" Bird flu is different from the influenza virus that affects humans. Seasonal flu vaccines for humans do not protect against avian viruses. The CDC, the U.S. Agriculture Department, and the Food and Drug Administration, along with state health and veterinary officials, say they are closely monitoring developments. The CDC has a tool that gauges how likely bird flu will efficiently spread between humans. It was last updated in April 2023, after the virus had spread to a commercial mink farm in Spain. H5 bird flu is widespread among wild birds and has been documented to infect dozens of other mammalian species, but it rarely spreads between them. These viruses have caused outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry flocks, leading to the culling of millions of poultry. Epidemiologists have been worried about the growing number of mammals infected by the highly pathogenic avian influenza - commonly known as HPAI - around the world. Last month, HPAI was found in a baby goat in Minnesota, the first case in U.S. livestock. The virus was detected in dairy herds in Texas and Kansas on March 25. Unpasteurized milk from sick cattle collected from two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, as well as a throat swab from a cow in another dairy in Texas, tested positive. Testing showed the genetic clade to be the same that is widespread among birds globally. Since then, bird flu has spread to additional herds in at least five states, adding evidence that the virus may be spreading cow-to-cow. The strain was confirmed in a Michigan dairy on March 29, and presumptive positive tests have also been reported from Idaho and New Mexico, federal officials said Friday. Preliminary analysis has not found mutations that would make these viruses resistant to FDA-approved antiviral medications for flu, the CDC said Monday.

It went on to say that the individual’s only symptom is eye inflammation infection of the conjunctiva, the tissue surrounding the eye. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the infected individual is doing well and is being treated with the influenza antiviral oseltamivir, sold as Tamiflu. The individual was instructed to isolate to reduce the risk of infecting others, and to date there’s no indication of onward spread, Shah said.

The CDC is not currently running any other confirmatory H5 tests, Shah said. “The fact that there are not other samples cooking right now is reassuring, insofar as that we’re not aware of other individuals who are symptomatic following an exposure to livestock,” he added. “We are still out there looking, to be very clear,” he said. “Our antennae are up and we have been working with state public health officials in a number of jurisdictions to look for individuals who report signs and symptoms of illness, to make sure they know how to get tested.” NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy Three states Texas, Kansas, and Michigan have recently reported they have had confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in cattle; New Mexico and Idaho have also reported outbreaks in cattle that are presumed to have been caused by H5N1. The virus doesn’t kill the cattle, but milk production is lowered and the animals’ feeding is reduced. Owners of implicated herds have been told to destroy milk produced by infected cattle, though if milk from infected animals made its way into the food chain, pasteurization could kill the virus, the CDC statement said. Up until now, cows have not been on the ever-lengthening list of animals that have been known to be susceptible to this virus. Infections of the highly pathogenic bird flu a term that describes how it behaves in poultry have been detected in many other mammals, though, including big cats, bears, foxes, skunks, sea lions, and seals. Despite the alarming increase in the past few years of the virus’s geographic range and the number of species it has been seen to infect, both the World Health Organization and the CDC currently assess its risk to people as low. The news of the case in Texas does not change that, Shah said. Trending Now: This AI company scans penis pictures for STIs. Its unproven tech is in an FDA gray zone H5N1 bird flu has been high on the worry list of experts on emerging diseases for the past two decades. Over that time there have been nearly 900 human infections in 23 countries; just over half of those infections have been fatal. But in recent years the strain of the virus circulating in many parts of the world including the United States seems to trigger human infections less frequently than earlier versions of the virus did. And when human cases caused by this strain occur, they are typically mild. A case in point was the country’s first H5 infection, which occurred in 2022. A man who was involved in culling infected poultry in Colorado reported feeling fatigued; he tested positive for the virus. It was unclear if he was actually even infected or simply had viruses in his nose that were picked up by a nasal swab test. The low rate of human infections and the mildness of most cases when they occur has counterbalanced concern about the virus’s astonishing spread. But people who have studied influenza and this virus in particular for years do not know what to make of its movement into so many different animal species. Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., called the infections in cows “a head scratcher,” saying he would not have figured cattle to be on the list of animals susceptible to this virus. “​​This particular version of H5 is teaching us a number of things we thought we knew weren’t right,” Webby said. He termed the news of the Texas case “not unexpected, but always a concern.” Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, said the move into cows expands the virus’ range, “but I’m not sure what it portends for humans and swine.” Osterholm said he would be more concerned if there were word that the virus had been found to be infecting pigs. Pigs can be infected with human and avian flu viruses and co-infection of more than one type of virus in pigs can produce reassortants hybrid viruses that might be more able to infect people. As of now, he believes the risk H5N1 poses is not changed by the infection of cattle. “This all could change in a heartbeat with additional mutations.

{"id": "421", "title": "Here's the rundown on bird flu's risks, impacts", "date": "2024-04-03", "fulltext": "After a dairy worker in Texas was infected with a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, disease trackers worry the recent outbreak among cattle could develop into a larger threat. The risk to the general public remains low, but experts are concerned about the possibility of the H5N1 virus evolving and more easily spreading from birds to other mammals. Here's what to know about bird flu, its symptoms and treatment, and its risk to humans and pets. What is bird flu? Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in more than 9,000 wild birds and has affected more than 82 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since early 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm. Can humans catch bird flu? It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds - whether the birds are dead or alive - or with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces. Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks - probably from eating infected wild birds - experts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. Two human cases have been reported in the United States, including the case in Texas, which the CDC announced Monday. The first case was in 2022, when a person in Colorado with direct exposure to poultry tested positive for the same strain. Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis - an eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes - to more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said. The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain. A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus - by sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example - to develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. \"In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia,\" he said, and then \"the fatality rate is very high.\" What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans? Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms - fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing. The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the past 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said. Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat. How is it treated? People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said. Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans? Yes, there are vaccines for the bird flu. But they would need to be tested to determine whether they are a match for this specific strain. Vaccine manufacturing would then need to be scaled up and mass-produced. Can bird flu kill humans? Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare. According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and February 2024, 887 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 were reported globally from 23 countries. Of those who were infected, there were 462 deaths. While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Could bird flu become the next pandemic? Each time there is highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person. That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people. Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchange of genetic material is a random event. \"If anything, the odds are against it,\" Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although the strain has infected some mammals - including mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm in October 2022 - \"that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans,\" he said. Can dogs and cats catch bird flu? Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said. Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons. \"If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection,\" Cardona said. Is there an impact to the nation's dairy supply? Federal agencies are reassuring the public about the nation's dairy supply after the bird flu was recently found in dairy cows. Since milk products are pasteurized, \"there continues to be no concern about the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,\" the Food and Drug Administration said in a notice on its website. Only milk from healthy animals is authorized to be distributed into interstate commerce for humans to consume, the agency said, adding that \"pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza.\" That means there hasn't been much impact on the country's supply of milk or the cost of dairy products. Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs? No. Humans cannot become infected by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs. However, according to the CDC, \"uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia.\" The CDC advises that \"it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States.\" Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry - and other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry - are typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. \"It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products,\" she said. \"They don't even make it into your pet food.\" What about my backyard chickens? People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said. Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease. Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying. People who have backyard chickens should take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said. Does risk vary by state or country? Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. \"The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds, and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable,\" Iqbal said. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world. Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu? China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality. But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks. Britain, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly. In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds that may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed. Should you worry birds in your area are spreading avian flu? Wild birds - such as ducks, geese and swans - are most likely to be infected with this strain of bird flu, according to the CDC. It can easily be spread to poultry, like chickens and turkey. However, the most common songbirds or other birds found in backyards - like cardinals, robins and pigeons - don't usually carry bird flu viruses dangerous to poultry or humans. Generally, people should avoid direct contact with wild birds, the CDC states. What precautions are federal and state health officials recommending? Federal and state health officials are recommending that people avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals, including cattle, as well as animal carcasses, raw milk, feces, litter or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection. People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or food products, including unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheeses, from animals with confirmed or suspected bird flu. CDC is recommending that farmers and owners of poultry, backyard flock and livestock wear personal protective equipment, such as N95 masks, eye protection and gloves, as well as wash their hands thoroughly when in direct contact - or entering any buildings - with sick or dead birds or other animals, carcasses, or feces or litter of potentially infected animals. People exposed to birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection should be monitored for symptoms of illness for 10 days after the last known exposure, even if they were wearing recommended personal protective equipment. http://www.washingtonpost.com WP20240403faq-birdflu", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": "it doesn't specify that this strain might have a lower mortality rate", "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, citing 462 deaths out of 887 cases.

The H5N1 avian flu has spread rapidly since a new strain was detected in 2020, affecting wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry and backyard flocks. But it has now even been detected in mammals, with cattle herds across four states becoming infected, and on Monday, federal health officials announced that a dairy worker in Texas caught the virus. 'This virus [has been] on the top of the pandemic list for many, many years and probably decades,' Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, a bird flu researcher from Pittsburgh, said at a recent panel discussing the issue, according to the Daily Mail. 'And now we're getting dangerously close to this virus potentially causing a pandemic.' The H5N1 bird flu is spreading rapidly across mammals and has even infected a dairy worker in Texas. via REUTERS He noted that the H5N1 virus has already been detected in species throughout the world and 'has shown the ability to infect a range of mammalian hosts, including humans.' 'So therefore, in my view, I think this is a virus that has the greatest pandemic threat [that is] playing out in plain sight and globally present,' Kuchipudi said.

'This appears to be 100 times worse than COVID � or it could be if it mutates and maintains its high case fatality rate,' he said. 'Once it's mutated to infect humans, we can only hope that the [fatality rate] drops.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has maintained that the threat to humans is low. REUTERS Around 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization. For comparison, COVID currently kills less than 0.1% of those it infects � though at the start of the pandemic, the fatality rate was around 20%. Symptoms of the bird flu are similar to those of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people may not develop noticeable symptoms, but others can develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia. The dairy worker in Texas who was infected has reported 'eye redness (consistent with conjunctivitis)' as their only symptom, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted. 'The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with an antiviral drug for [the] flu,' the CDC said. Around 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization. REUTERS The agency and 'the whole U.S. government is taking this situation very seriously,' CDC Director Mandy Cohen told the Washington Post. She maintained that the virus does not pose much of a risk to the general public, noting that the dairy worker was in direct contact with infected cattle, and the US Department of Agriculture has said there are currently no changes that would make it more transmissible to humans. 'While cases among humans in direct contact with infected animals are possible, this indicates that the current risk to the public remains low,' the department said in a statement over the weekend. But the fact that the virus has been found in cattle could mean it is starting to mutate, Cohen told the Washington Post. 'We had not seen avian flu in cattle prior to last week. That is new,' she said. 'It is a reservoir for [the] virus to circulate and potentially change.' If the virus does mutate enough to infect humans, it could spread rapidly, the European Food Safety Authority warned on Wednesday, according to Fox News. 'If avian A [H5N1] influenza viruses acquire the ability to spread efficiently among humans, large-scale transmission could occur due to the lack of immune defenses against H5 viruses in humans,' the Food Safety Authority said. The United States is already testing components used to create a vaccine for the virus. REUTERS To prevent any potential spread, the US is already testing components used to create a vaccine for the virus, and two candidate vaccine viruses appear to be well-matched to protect against H5N1, the Washington Post reports.

{"id": "431", "title": "How dangerous is the bird flu outbreak? Here's what I'm telling my patients.", "date": "2024-04-05", "fulltext": "I have tracked deadly, massive outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry for the past two decades. Hundreds of millions of birds have died, and there has been frequent spillover to other species, including mink, seals, foxes, skunks and even dogs and cats. This week, the nation's largest supplier of eggs stopped production after birds at a plant in Texas tested positive. About 2 million chickens were slaughtered to prevent spread of the illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that a person in Texas had contracted the flu but is displaying only mild symptoms. The public has worried at times about a massive human pandemic, but since 2005, the structure of the bird flu virus has not changed significantly. That is extremely good news, especially when you consider that gain-of-function research conducted in Dr. Ron Fouchier� lab in the Netherlands in 2011 revealed the mutations needed for bird flu to pass from human to human. Monitoring of the virus in nature has shown that those mutations have yet to occur. I spoke this week with CDC Director Mandy Cohen, who told me that the current spillover of bird flu to cattle has not shown any significant genetic changes. That is also good news. The outbreak has occurred only in a few states (Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas), but cattle are brought from state to state and could have picked up the virus from birds. Dr. Cohen told me that the cattle have shown mild upper respiratory symptoms. Can you import prescriptions? Florida can now import prescription drugs from Canada. It's great news to my patients. Person with bird flu experienced mild symptoms The patient in Texas also had mild symptoms �onjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms. She said the man was treated with Tamiflu and quickly got better. People in close contact with him also were given Tamiflu, as a precaution against further spread. Click to view image. Dr. Cohen said there is potential for cattle to become the first mammals to become a reservoir of the bird flu. The CDC is working closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track cattle that have or have been exposed to the illness to determine if there is any sustained spread. Over the past two decades, more than 400 million birds either have died from the disease or been culled to prevent transmission. Yet, human cases remain rare, with only 2,634 cases and about 1,000 deaths. Bird flu pandemic? Experts look at worst-case scenarios. Don� get me wrong: It is the potential for the virus to adapt to human transmission over time that keeps many scientists and public health specialists up at night. But far too often, those experts are looking at worst-case scenarios to the detriment of public perception. Fear is at the heart of public and media reactions to the potential of bird flu and other viruses to become a much-deadlier threat to humans. Your doctor might not listen to you. AI can help change that. David Nabarro, a senior World Health Organizations expert on infectious diseases, warned the public in 2005 that up to 150 million people could die of bird flu. And though his prediction was far from reality, it was taken seriously at the time. Since then, there have been intermittent flare-ups of public fears, stoked by the idea that bird flu will become the WHO� so-called Disease X, a virus with a high death rate that spreads easily and quickly.

That is not only reassuring now but also is likely to continue to be the case. The greater danger remains the fear of the virus rather than the virus itself. But there is one major caveat. The road map, developed by Dr. Fouchier, for a mutation deadly to humans could end up in the wrong hands. And that risk is enough to keep everyone up at night. Click to view image.

{"id": "433", "title": "Avian Flu and the Experts Who Cried Wolf; If Americans don't line up for jabs, the public-health establishment will have itself to blame.", "date": "2024-04-07", "fulltext": "A bird-flu pandemic could \"be 100 times worse than Covid,\" media outlets warn, citing experts. Readers roll their eyes, and for good reason. The press profits from scaring the public, as does the public-health industry. Covid-19 spurred governments to spend heavily on public-health systems. Yet should another pandemic occur, the U.S. will be in a far worse position to respond to it than it was four years ago. No amount of spending on vaccines and virus surveillance can compensate for the public trust health experts have squandered. Scientists for decades predicted that a pandemic could arise if a virus spills over from animals to humans. Covid's emergence seemed to validate that. The novel coronavirus was nearly identical to a virus found in bats, though it included some genetic oddities that made it more transmissible among humans. Further research suggested that these oddities, especially a furin cleavage site, likely resulted from gain-of-function experiments by Chinese scientists that accelerated its adaptation to humans. Experts such as Anthony Fauci dismissed this hypothesis as a conspiracy theory. Many refused to wrestle with the evidence and ridiculed scientists with unorthodox views on the virus's origins, as well as on lockdowns, school closures and masks. Even when their shibboleths proved harmful, they stuck to them. Can Americans be blamed for doubting experts who now say that the avian flu could pose a great threat to the public, but that the government is well-prepared? It isn't impossible that the H5N1 avian flu�hich has transmitted from wild birds to chickens and has been found in cattle, mountain lions and raccoons�ould mutate and spread among humans. But it isn't likely. First identified in Chinese geese in 1996, H5N1 has caused periodic outbreaks among chickens, as well as humans and animals directly exposed to them. There have been 888 documented human cases in 23 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. This is likely an underestimate, since people with mild symptoms might not have been checked. A recently infected Texas man, exposed to the virus from sick cattle, developed mild symptoms such as red eyes. This would suggest that the WHO's estimate that the virus is fatal in 50% or more case is inflated. The same was true of Covid, which even before the vaccine became available was nearly 90% less deadly than scientists initially estimated. Biden administration officials say that avian flu vaccines have already been developed and could be rapidly manufactured. But don't be surprised if Americans don't line up to get them. Public-health experts blame \"antivaxxers\" for sowing distrust in jabs. But four years ago, these same people, along with the press, fueled skepticism about the Trump administration's efforts to develop a vaccine. During the summer and autumn of 2020, they warned that the president was in a dangerous rush. Washington Post reporters on June 1, 2020, warned that \"scientists fear regulators could come under pressure to approve a vaccine before it is fully vetted for safety and effectiveness.\" On Sept. 4, 2020, the newspaper published an op-ed claiming that \"Trump's rush for a Covid vaccine could make it less likely to work.\" The piece warned that past might be prologue, noting the swine-flu vaccine in 1976 \"meant to help President Gerald Ford's election campaign not only proved ineffective but also afflicted hundreds with a paralyzing side effect.\" \"The history of vaccines is full of alarming missteps,\" warned medical analyst Kent Sepkowitz at CNN.com on Sept. 10. \"The current rush to vaccination,\" he opined, \"is most reminiscent\" of a Lyme disease vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998, which was later pulled from the market after complaints about painful side effects spurred lawsuits. On Sept. 22, 2020, the Washington Post published another op-ed, by former Harvard Medical School professor William Haseltine, warning that \"rushed Moderna and Pfizer trials could bring about similar short-term health consequences or, potentially far worse, lead to long-term health consequences that we won't discover until months or years after the vaccine's approval.\" Democratic politicians including Kamala Harris also suggested that the FDA was politically pliable and that Covid vaccines couldn't be trusted. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he wanted state health officials to review the vaccine. \"The first question is, is the vaccine safe? Frankly, I'm not going to trust the federal government's opinion.\" According to the Pew Research Center, the share of Americans who said they would probably or definitely get the Covid vaccine plunged to 51% in September 2020 from 72% that May, with an equal reduction among members of both political parties. The public-health clerisy accuses conservatives of fomenting distrust in science and vaccines. They might look in the mirror.

{"id": "435", "title": "As bird flu spreads, the Biden admin remains dangerously unprepared for another pandemic", "date": "2024-04-09", "fulltext": "The H5N1 virus � which for 30 years affected mostly birds � is rapidly evolving and spreading globally. The Biden administration is dangerously unready. Over the last two years, H5N1 has jumped from birds to mammals, sickening some 30 species. South American scientists publishing in the prestigious journal Nature report massive \"sea lion die-offs\" and warn about \"mutations of concern\" \"potentially evolving into the next global pandemic.\" Here in the United States, dairy cows, never before vulnerable to bird flu, are infected in six states. Is the public in danger? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk is \"low\" but is advising states to be ready with rapid tests. In the United States, only two human cases have been reported. Neither person died. But nearly 1,000 people in other parts of the world have contracted the virus � almost always from touching a sick or dead bird or bird feces. Half died. Some food-safety experts caution against eating runny egg yolks, cheeses made with raw milk and foods made with uncooked eggs. There are too many unknowns to predict whether H5N1 will kill people here. It seems unlikely, but better to be prepared. Here's what needs to change: Don't censure the scientists Like H5N1, COVID-19 was full of unknowns. The federal government's biggest mistake was to aim for an illusion of consensus � rather than welcoming debate. The feds silenced anyone, including scientists, who disagreed. The result was a long string of deadly mistakes, from shuttering businesses to mandatory masking to school closures. Stanford health professor Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and former Harvard medical professor Martin Kulldorff coauthored the Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020 showing that protecting the elderly and vulnerable, rather than shutting down the entire nation, would save more lives. Within hours, federal bigwigs Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci launched a smear campaign to label Bhattacharya and his fellow signers \"fringe epidemiologists.\" Worse, the CDC and Department of Homeland Security conspired with major social-media platforms such as YouTube and Twitter (now X) to keep the public from hearing from the government's critics. Censored scientists sued. The case, Murthy v. Missouri, is before the US Supreme Court. The Biden administration is taking the wrong side, claiming censorship protects the nation from \"disinformation.\" That's a sign the administration can't be trusted to tell us the truth during the next health scare. Create a domestic supply chain for hospital supplies When COVID-19 struck, the United States was caught short of masks, respirators and other hospital gear. One-third of America's imported medical supplies for COVID came from China. In early 2020, the Chinese Communist Party nationalized medical supplies, cutting off exports. US shortages continue even now. On Nov. 27, 2023, Biden called for \"assessments\" of the nation's domestic production capacity. Sorry, too late for more reports. Time to act. Curb dictatorial governors During COVID-19, state Legislatures like sheep ceded their authority to governors, allowing them to shutter schools, churches, businesses and recreational facilities. Fortunately, some states eventually came to their senses, including New York, and undid those grants of authority or time-limited them. Biden and the left-wing media were highly critical of these states � a sure sign more states need to curb emergency health powers before the next health crisis. Never underestimate government's stupidity Not even four months ago, when public-health authorities were already tracking H5N1's arrival in the United States, the National Institutes of Health awarded funding for a project � Virus Hunters � tasking New York City high schoolers with collecting bird feces from public parks to map the spread of avian influenza. Students will wear face masks and gloves and collect the bird poop with cotton swabs. What could go wrong? Students could contract the virus by touching bird excrement and then their own eyes, nose or mouth, cautions Brown University infectious-disease expert Leonard Mermel. Trust this government with your life? Ridiculous. To prepare for a pandemic, start by curbing government's power over your decisions.

{"id": "437", "title": "Public's fear is a greater threat than bird flu outbreak itself", "date": "2024-04-10", "fulltext": "I have tracked deadly, massive outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry for the past two decades. Hundreds of millions of birds have died, and there has been frequent spillover to other species, including mink, seals, foxes, skunks and even dogs and cats. This week, the nation's largest supplier of eggs stopped production after birds at a plant in Texas tested positive. About 2 million chickens were slaughtered to prevent spread of the illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that a person in Texas had contracted the flu but is displaying only mild symptoms. The public has worried at times about a massive human pandemic, but since 2005, the structure of the bird flu virus has not changed significantly. That is extremely good news, especially when you consider that gain-of-function research conducted in Dr. Ron Fouchier's lab in the Netherlands in 2011 revealed the mutations needed for bird flu to pass from human to human. Monitoring of the virus in nature has shown that those mutations have yet to occur. I spoke with CDC Director Mandy Cohen, who told me that the current spillover of bird flu to cattle has not shown any significant genetic changes. That is also good news. The outbreak has occurred only in a few states (Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas), but cattle are brought from state to state and could have picked up the virus from birds. Dr. Cohen told me that the cattle have shown mild upper respiratory symptoms. Person had with bird flu had mild symptoms The patient in Texas also had mild symptoms �onjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms. She said the man was treated with Tamiflu and quickly got better. People in close contact with him also were given Tamiflu, as a precaution against further spread. Dr. Cohen said there is potential for cattle to become the first mammals to become a reservoir of the bird flu. The CDC is working closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track cattle that have or have been exposed to the illness to determine if there is any sustained spread. Over the past two decades, more than 400 million birds either have died from the disease or been culled to prevent transmission. Yet, human cases remain rare, with only 2,634 cases and about 1,000 deaths. Worst-case scenarios Don't get me wrong: It is the potential for the virus to adapt to human transmission over time that keeps many scientists and public health specialists up at night. But far too often, those experts are looking at worst-case scenarios to the detriment of public perception. Fear is at the heart of public and media reactions to the potential of bird flu and other viruses to become a much-deadlier threat to humans. David Nabarro, a senior World Health Organizations expert on infectious diseases, warned the public in 2005 that up to 150 million people could die of bird flu. And though his prediction was far from reality, it was taken seriously. Since then, there have been intermittent flare-ups of public fears, stoked by the idea that bird flu will become the WHO's so-called Disease X, a virus with a high death rate that spreads quickly. But the species barrier that protects us from bird flu is still in place, and the risk to the public remains extremely low, according to the CDC director. That is not only reassuring now but also is likely to continue to be the case. The greater danger remains the fear of the virus rather than the virus itself. But there is one major caveat. The road map, developed by Dr. Fouchier, for a mutation deadly to humans could end up in the wrong hands. And that risk is enough to keep everyone up at night.

{"id": "445", "title": "Why the spread of bird flu to a Texas dairy worker is so alarming", "date": "2024-04-16", "fulltext": "Since early 2022, a highly pathogenic strain of avian flu, H5N1, has been infecting wild aquatic birds and domestic poultry in the United States. More than 85 million birds in 48 states have died as a result of the virus or have been culled after exposure to infected birds. This same strain has now spread to cows. Health officials have detected H5N1 in cattle across 16 herds in six states. And this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a case of bird flu in a dairy worker in Texas who likely contracted the virus from cattle. This is an alarming situation that must be monitored closely. Livestock workers and owners of backyard flocks need to take extra precautions, and clinicians should be on the lookout for new human cases. Most Americans, though, should not be concerned about the risk of avian flu to them at this time. Avian influenza is not new. The first description of it dates from the late 1800s. Like human flu viruses, there are multiple strains of bird flu. Some strains cause mild or no symptoms. Others are associated with mortality rates as high as 90 to 100 percent in domesticated bird species. Many bird flu viruses originate in wild aquatic fowl and are then passed on to chickens, turkeys and other domesticated birds. While most transmission occurs among birds, some strains can cross over to infect mammals. The H5N1 strain has already been detected in more than 200 mammals in the United States. That includes humans. In addition to the Texas dairy worker, an individual in Colorado working with poultry was diagnosed with H5N1 in 2022. The dairy worker's only symptom was eye inflammation, and the poultry worker experienced fatigue. But prior cases from elsewhere in the world have resulted in pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death. Indeed, the specter of severe illness is what makes avian flu a worrisome disease. The World Health Organization reports that 887 people globally have been infected with this strain over the past two decades. The mortality rate was 52 percent. That is a terrifying number. Though there are approved H5N1-specific vaccines, it will take months to ramp up production. (The current seasonal flu vaccine probably does not prevent avian flu, though the CDC recommends it because it prevents people from contracting the regular flu at the same time.) There are antiviral treatments that should reduce the risk of hospitalization and death, but mortality could still be substantial if many people become infected. Here's the reassuring part: Transmission among humans has, so far, been uncommon. Most people infected with bird flu worked closely with infected animals. Of those who contracted avian flu from other humans, most were living in the same household with a symptomatic person, resulting in close, prolonged and unprotected exposure. During the current H5N1 outbreaks, there has been no documented human-to-human transmission. Of course, this could change. The more widespread the virus becomes among other mammalian species, the more it could acquire mutations that facilitate its spread among humans. Clinicians need to be on the lookout for people who work with animals and start experiencing symptoms. Scientists must continue tracking the spread of H5N1 in other species, and the federal government should ensure that a robust plan is in place should widespread vaccine distribution be needed. For now, most people do not need to change their daily lives. Specifically, they do not need to stop drinking milk or eating chicken. Pasteurizing milk and cooking poultry kills pathogens, including the avian influenza viruses. Those who have frequent contact with birds should take additional precautions. Bird flu is spread through direct contact with secretions from the animal's mouth or nose, or through its feces. The virus can also be inhaled as well as transmitted from someone touching a contaminated surface and then their mouth, nose or eyes. The CDC recommends that poultry workers, individuals who rehabilitate birds in sanctuaries and people with backyard flocks use eye protection and a well-fitting face mask if they have to handle sick birds. They should avoid touching their mouth, nose or eyes after contact with possibly contaminated objects. Hand-washing is a must, and workers should change clothes after handling birds. Hobbyists, meanwhile, should observe wild birds at a distance and especially stay away from birds that look sick or have died. Finally, it's worth remembering that avian flu is one of more than 200 diseases that are spread between animals and humans. Zoonotic diseases have been increasing with warming climates, urbanization and the destruction of natural habitats, which have all accelerated contact between humans and wild animals.

{"id": "446", "title": "Opinion: What worries scientists like me about bird flu", "date": "2024-04-17", "fulltext": "(CNN) � The headlines are concerning: \"Highly pathogenic avian influenza found in Texas, Kansas dairy cattle.\" \"Bird flu detected in dairy worker.\" \"First human case of avian flu in Texas raises alarm.\" Could this be how the next pandemic begins? Well, so far US officials are saying they believe there is minimal risk to the public from the latest iteration of bird flu. But with growing evidence of potential mammal-to-mammal spread just weeks after the new bird flu was detected in cows, many of us in the biosecurity and pandemic preparedness community believe that leaders in capitals around the globe should be working to get ahead of this new public health threat in case the H5N1 flu virus gains the ability to spread among humans. There have also been documented cases of transmission to people: Earlier this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a second person in the US had tested positive for bird flu. The first US H5N1 human case was in 2022, involving a poultry worker in Colorado, and the more recent case involved a dairy worker who had direct contact with infected cattle in Texas. Both human cases had mild symptoms, were treated and fully recovered, but previous bird flu cases in other parts of the world have been much more severe, causing fatalities in many cases. What we don't know � and what has scientists worried � is whether the virus will evolve in a way that enables it to spread more readily among human populations. In March, a first case was reported of H5N1 virus in cattle and while direct cow-to-cow transmission has yet to be confirmed, the occurrence of cases in cattle across at least six states suggests that cows may be transmitting the flu virus directly among themselves as they are transported to different farms, as opposed to being infected by sick birds. While we face uncertainty about what will happen next, many scientists say stepped-up government action is warranted because of the risk that bird flu could turn into a pandemic. Many researchers believe that Covid-19 may have started in a similar way � spreading from animals to humans by first gaining the ability to spread among mammals that came into contact with humans, and then evolving to transmit directly between humans. The US and other governments around the world need to take H5N1 seriously and demonstrate that we've learned the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic that turned our lives upside-down for years. They should take immediate steps to get out ahead of this risk rather than taking a \"wait and see\" approach. In the short term, governments should act now to deploy the capacities at their disposal to guard against the uncontrolled spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus if it evolves to spread between people. This includes funding research on vaccines that are likely to be effective against the virus, stepping up surveillance of livestock and humans and wider emergency response planning. It has been encouraging to hear that the US Department of Health and Human Services has stepped up surveillance systems and supported testing of potential vaccine candidates that could be more effective against this strain of bird flu than the existing, limited stocks of H5N1 vaccine developed many years ago. Moving forward, it will be critical for human and animal health sectors � including the CDC and the US Department of Agriculture � to work together on bio-surveillance, including by developing a shared approach to monitoring human and animal populations and by exchanging data, to keep tabs on how the virus is evolving. Additionally, if the US government succeeds in identifying an effective vaccine for the new bird flu, it will be important to draw up plans to rapidly produce the vaccine, so that it is ready to go if needed. Further, the US and other governments should think through how to update and act on their existing pandemic flu response plans in case H5N1 begins to spread among humans. To be prepared for a possible outbreak of bird flu, governments around the world need to take these steps now, even in the face of uncertainty. If they wait for a confirmed outbreak among people, it will be extremely difficult to prevent the uncontrolled spread of the virus. It's also time to reassess the long game and make sure that countries around the world have the capacity to detect and respond to future epidemics and pandemics. According to the Global Health Security Index, there are significant gaps in countries' pandemic preparedness capabilities. During the Covid pandemic, we witnessed firsthand that capacity matters when it comes to saving lives. According to a study released last year by experts from the Brown University Pandemic Center, the Gates Foundation and NTI, almost all countries that had strong pandemic preparedness capacity at the outset of Covid had lower death rates than less prepared nations. A broad range of capacities have been shown to be effective, including disease detection systems, systems for distributing medical countermeasures and public health infrastructure to deploy non-pharmaceutical interventions. Playing the long game means investing now to make sure that countries have the capacity they need to respond to a worst-case H5N1 pandemic or to be prepared for the next one. Given the impact of Covid, it is deeply disappointing that national governments are not investing the necessary resources to build life-saving pandemic preparedness capacity. This just doesn't make sense. In the United States, federal funding for pandemic influenza is far below what we need to effectively tackle this threat. Government experts have called for $1.15 billion in funding for pandemic influenza for 2025, but the Biden administration has requested only $335 million. Making matters worse, Congress has made major cuts to pandemic preparedness funding, as part of the ongoing appropriations process. This is also an issue internationally. Most countries � even those with ample resources � have not made financial investments in strengthening pandemic preparedness. The 2021 Global Health Security Index � which measures national-level pandemic preparedness capacity and which was collaboratively developed by NTI, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Economist Impact � found that 155 out of 195 countries have not allocated funds within the last three years to improve capacity (aside from public health emergencies) to address epidemic threats. The White House just announced a new Global Health Security Strategy, which includes a commitment to work with 50 countries to build pandemic preparedness capacity. This is a great step in the right direction, but the US government and their partners will need to make sure they have the financial resources and political will to follow through on this pledge. Playing the long game also means supporting the World Bank Pandemic Fund, which is designed to invest in long-term pandemic preparedness capacity of low- and middle-income countries. The fund received $1.9 billion dollars in pledged resources from national governments, philanthropic organizations and other groups, but it is making grants to support valuable capacity building efforts and will soon run out of funds. Experts estimate that it will take approximately $10 billion per year for at least five years to provide the funding that will allow countries to build infectious disease detection and response capacity that will be needed to guard against pandemics. We must do better. Covid made pandemic risks clear, and unfortunately in many parts of the world, we witnessed the deadly consequences. Governments need to act quickly and decisively now, to get ahead of the growing H5N1 flu public health threat, while also investing in long-term capacity building to make sure the world is better prepared for the next pandemic.

Cows and goats joined the list of species affected last month � surprising development for experts because they were not thought susceptible to this type of influenza.

The A(H5N1) variant has become � global zoonotic animal pandemic� Farrar said. �he great concern of course is that in... infecting ducks and chickens and then increasingly mammals, that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically the ability to go from human to human,�e added. So far, there is no evidence that H5N1 is spreading between humans. But in the hundreds of cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals over the past 20 years, �he mortality rate is extraordinarily high� Farrar said, because humans have no natural immunity to the virus. From 2003 to 2024, 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 have been reported worldwide from 23 countries, according to the WHO, putting the case fatality rate at 52%. The recent US case of human infection after contact with an infected mammal highlights the increased risk. When �ou come into the mammalian population, then you�e getting closer to humans� Farrar said, warning that �his virus is just looking for new, novel hosts� Farrar called for increased monitoring, saying it was �ery important understanding how many human infections are happening... because that� where adaptation [of the virus] will happen� �t� a tragic thing to say, but if I get infected with H5N1 and I die, that� the end of it,�e said. �f I go around the community and I spread it to somebody else then you start the cycle.� He said efforts were under way towards the development of vaccines and therapeutics for H5N1, and stressed the need to ensure that regional and national health authorities around the world had the capacity to diagnose the virus.

{"id": "451", "title": "Bird flu virus now found in milk, is of \"great concern\" to WHO", "date": "2024-04-19", "fulltext": "A recent statement from the World Health Organization is sure to ruffle a few feathers. The international health group expressed \"great concern\" over the rising number of bird flu cases in humans. The organization also announced Friday that the virus has been found in raw milk. Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at the WHO, noted that the avian flu, also called H5N1, had an \"extremely high\" mortality rate among those who had been infected around the world. Avian flu has now been identified in raw milk, the WHO said Friday. panyawat � stock.adobe.com The illness remains extremely rare in the US, with just two known cases, one that occurred earlier this month and one that occurred in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In both of those cases, the infected individuals worked in close proximity to livestock. No human-to-human transmissions of the disease have occurred. \"The great concern, of course, is that � [the] virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,\" Farrar warned. On Friday, the WHO further warned that the virus has been found in raw milk. Officials said that drinking pasteurized milk � which is the kind sold throughout the US in grocery stores � is still safe. Dairy farmers in the US are also required to destroy milk from infected cows, so it should not make its way into the food supply chain in the first place. The WHO warned that the virus has been found in raw milk. Drinking pasteurized milk is still safe, officials said. 88studio � stock.adobe.com Dr. Wenqing Zhang, who leads the WHO's global flu program, said that the virus had been identified in a \"very high virus concentration in raw milk\" from infected cows, according to the Daily Mail. Researchers are still trying to determine how long the virus might be able to survive in milk. In general, drinking raw milk is always a bad idea, as raw milk can carry other contaminants, like salmonella, listeria and E. coli � all of which can make you sick. Cases of avian flu in humans remain very rare, with just two known infections identified in the US. ZUMAPRESS.com Zhang also reiterated the cases that have been identified in the US and in Europe have been relatively mild. There are two types of avian flu tracked by the CDC � low pathogenic and highly pathogenic. The latter, as you can probably guess, is more serious because it has a higher mortality rate in poultry, 90% � 100% and often within 48 hours. The person in Texas who contracted the illness earlier this month has the highly pathogenic form of the virus. Since January 2022, the CDC notes that over 90 million birds have been infected in 48 states. But the current outbreak isn't just affecting birds, it's affecting cattle as well. Currently, eight states have avian flu cattle outbreaks. The WHO urged US officials to monitor the situation closely because the virus could \"evolve into transmitting in different ways.\" Experts have warned of the potential for an avian flu pandemic for years, with some saying it could be \"100 times worse\" than COVID-19. REUTERS see also As bird flu spreads, the Biden admin remains dangerously unprepared for another pandemic \"Do the milking structures of cows create aerosols? Is it the environment which they're living in? Is it the transport system that is spreading this around the country?\" Farrar questioned. \"This is a huge concern and I think we have to � make sure that if H5N1 did come across to humans with human-to-human transmission, that we were in a position to immediately respond with access equitably to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\" This is hardly the first warning of a potential bird flu pandemic. Earlier this month, scientists sounded the alarm that such a pandemic could be \"100 times worse than COVID.\" \"This virus [has been] on the top of the pandemic list for many, many years and probably decades,\" said Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, a bird flu researcher from Pittsburgh, according to the Daily Mail. The only hope, officials went on, is that the virus would be less deadly in humans than it is in birds. \"Once it's mutated to infect humans, we can only hope that the [fatality rate] drops,\" said John Fulton, a pharmaceutical industry consultant for vaccines, according to the Mail. Between 2003 and 2019, 861 cases of the avian flu were identified globally and 455 people have died, meaning that the fatality rate is nearly 53%, according to the CDC. If a pandemic were to occur, the Food and Drug Administration has a few vaccines for humans on hand, Forbes reported.

{"id": "452", "title": "WHO chief scientist calls for increased monitoring and preparation for highly pathogenic bird flu", "date": "2024-04-19", "fulltext": "(CNN) � The bird flu spreading through cattle in the United States is an \"enormous concern\" the chief scientist of the World Health Organization said Thursday as he called for more tracking and preparation for the virus. So far, there is no evidence that the highly pathogenic H5N1 flu virus can spread from person to person. This flu strain was first detected in birds in 1996 and has primarily been a threat to farmed and wild fowl, but in the past two years, an increasing number of mammals have tested positive with the virus, indicating that the virus is looking for new hosts and moving closer to people. \"The great concern, of course, is that in doing so and infecting ducks and chickens � but now increasingly mammals � that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,\" Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British medical researcher and chief scientist at WHO since 2023, told reporters on Thursday in Geneva. \"We have to watch, more than watch, we have to make sure that if H5N1 did come across to humans with human-to-human transmission that we were in a position to immediately respond with access equitably to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\" Farrar's comments came in a response to a question during a news conference about WHO's new definition for airborne pathogens. Though H5N1 doesn't spread from person to person, humans can catch it when they're exposed to infected animals. In the US, one person in Texas has tested positive for H5N1 this year. That person was working with cows when they tested positive, and it is believed they caught it from an infected cow. They are only the second documented case of human H5N1 in the United States. The first was in a poultry worker in Colorado in 2022. Though it doesn't spread easily to humans, researchers are worried about it because of how deadly these infections can be. Since 2003, 889 human cases and 463 deaths have been reported from 23 countries, giving this virus a case fatality rate of 52%, according to the WHO. \"This virus is a really scary virus. It's something I would hate to see in humans,\" Dr. Richard Webby, director of the WHO's coordinating center for studies on the ecology of influenza and a scientist at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, told CNN. Webby, who has been studying H5N1 for 20 years, said even though this virus has never figured out how to efficiently make people sick, \"what's happening now there are lots more small mammals being infected with this virus and we've ever seen in the past 20, close to 25 years of monitoring, so that is absolutely concerning,\" he said. Webby said H5N1 is more active now than it ever has been, but it still hasn't developed key mutations that scientists are worried about that could help it infect people. \"Because we haven't seen those changes does suggest to me that this virus has got quite a hurdle to overcome to become a real sort of human pathogen,\" Webby said. So far in the United States, the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services has reported 29 infected herds in eight states � Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, South Dakota, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio and North Carolina. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that while the current risk to public health from H5N1 is low, it is monitoring the situation carefully. In an update posted to its situation summary on Thursday, the CDC said is studying the virus isolated from the recent human case in the US and found it to be susceptible to antiviral medications.

{"id": "453", "title": "WHO's top scientist sounds alarm about bird flu and need for vaccine development", "date": "2024-04-19", "fulltext": "World Health Organization� top scientist said this week the recent bird flu outbreak is of �reat concern�o public health, and vaccine development to halt the virus is �ot where we need to be.� The virus, known as Type A H5N1, which typically circulates among poultry and wild birds, has spread to mammals, including cows, cats and at least two people in the U.S. in recent years. The new development experts are eyeing is that the virus is now passing from mammal to mammal. Bird flu has a high mortality rate in the hundreds of people who've contracted it, Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at WHO, the United Nations health agency, told reporters on Thursday. Dairy cows, worker: Bird flu outbreak is an 'evolving situation.' Here's what to know about symptoms, spread. U.S. health officials say the country is ready to ramp up vaccine production if the risk of bird flu rises. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health remains low. \"It's too early to press the panic button,\" Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University and a leading expert in global health, told USA TODAY. The nightmare scenario, he explained, is if the virus makes a genetic leap and begins human-to-human transmission. This would be worse than the COVID-19 pandemic given how infectious and deadly the virus is, he said. While no human-to-human transmission has occurred, Farrar, of WHO, expressed concern about recent U.S. cases showing bird flu cases among cattle in several states and a Texas dairy worker. The infection has started to become a pandemic among animal species, he said at a news conference. �he great concern, of course, is that in doing so �nd infecting ducks and chickens, but now increasingly mammals �hat that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans,�e said. �nd then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission.� Farrar also flagged his concern that vaccine development is not �here we need to be�nd public health officials don� currently have the capability to diagnose H5N1. In a statement to USA TODAY, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response said its National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) program is equipped to respond rapidly to influenza strains as they evolve. �PIVS works closely with industry partners to make and test updated vaccines that match new strains of influenza viruses with pandemic potential as they emerge, while at the same time, supporting manufacturing capacity to allow for large-scale vaccine production if needed,�he statement said. There are two antigens that are �ell-matched�o the circulating strain of H5N1, the federal agency said. The agency said hundreds of thousands of doses of vaccine could be deployed within weeks, pending regulatory action by the Food and Drug Administration. Within months, federal officials could deploy more than 100 million doses. But Gostin, of Georgetown, said he doubts that's realistic. While the U.S. is comparatively better, the world lacks the capacity to ramp up hundreds of millions or billions of vaccines for a pandemic with bird flu. And even if the vaccine initially matches virus strains, the virus mutates quickly. He also noted that public health systems lack the ability for early detection and testing of bird flu. \"For many, many decades, these avian and swine influenzas have stayed within the animal kingdom,\" Gostin said. \"The hope and the expectation is that it will continue to do that. But one day, that virus will mutate and go to a human, and then spread to a global pandemic very, very quickly. And we have to be ready for that day.\" Bird flu in dairy cows in eight states, recent human case Eight states experienced recent bird flu outbreaks in dairy cows beginning in late March in Texas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture believes migratory birds were the source of the infection in cows. The virus then spread from herd to herd, experts believe, suggesting there has been transmission among mammals. Genomic sequencing of the viruses taken from infected cattle indicates this virus is not more transmissible to humans, the USDA said. On April 1, Texas health officials said a dairy worker was infected with bird flu after close contact with sick cows. The worker �he second person in the U.S. to get bird flu since 2022 �ad symptoms of conjunctivitis or eye redness. Bird flu spreads primarily through contact with infected birds, including sick or dead animals. Human cases are rare. Most occur in people who've had unprotected exposure to sick animals. The risk is heightened for people who work with infected poultry or livestock, and for veterinarians who treat infected animals. On Thursday, the WHO said it also updated its terms on airborne diseases for the next expected pandemic. Consulting with health agencies in the U.S., Africa, China and Europe, health officials are opting for �nfectious respiratory particles�nstead of �erosols�r �roplets�o avoid confusion about particle sizes, the U.N. said. This can better coordinate responses to respiratory pathogens, Farrar, of WHO, said. Karen Weintraub contributed to this report. The U.S. has seen dairy cows infected with bird flu across eight states, as one Texas dairy worker working among infected cattle also became sick.

{"id": "455", "title": "Bird Flu Is Infecting More Mammals. What Does That Mean for Us?", "date": "2024-04-22", "fulltext": "In her three decades of working with elephant seals, Dr. Marcela Uhart had never seen anything like the scene on the beaches of Argentina� Vald� Peninsula last October. It was peak breeding season; the beach should have been teeming with harems of fertile females and enormous males battling one another for dominance. Instead, it was �ust carcass upon carcass upon carcass,�ecalled Dr. Uhart, who directs the Latin American wildlife health program at the University of California, Davis. H5N1, one of the many viruses that cause bird flu, had already killed at least 24,000 South American sea lions along the continent� coasts in less than a year. Now it had come for elephant seals. Pups of all ages, from newborns to the fully weaned, lay dead or dying at the high-tide line. Sick pups lay listless, foam oozing from their mouths and noses. Dr. Uhart called it �n image from hell.� In the weeks that followed, she and a colleague �rotected head to toe with gloves, gowns and masks, and periodically dousing themselves with bleach �arefully documented the devastation. Team members stood atop the nearby cliffs, assessing the toll with drones. What they found was staggering: The virus had killed an estimated 17,400 seal pups, more than 95 percent of the colony� young animals. The catastrophe was the latest in a bird flu epidemic that has whipped around the world since 2020, prompting authorities on multiple continents to kill poultry and other birds by the millions. In the United States alone, more than 90 million birds have been culled in a futile attempt to deter the virus. There has been no stopping H5N1. Avian flu viruses tend to be picky about their hosts, typically sticking to one kind of wild bird. But this one has rapidly infiltrated an astonishingly wide array of birds and animals, from squirrels and skunks to bottlenose dolphins, polar bears and, most recently, dairy cows. �n my flu career, we have not seen a virus that expands its host range quite like this,�aid Troy Sutton, a virologist who studies avian and human influenza viruses at Penn State University. The blow to sea mammals, and to dairy and poultry industries, is worrying enough. But a bigger concern, experts said, is what these developments portend: The virus is adapting to mammals, edging closer to spreading among people. A human pandemic is by no means inevitable. So far at least, the changes in the virus do not signal that H5N1 can cause a pandemic, Dr. Sutton said. Still, he said, �e really don� know how to interpret this or what it means.� Marine mortalities A highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 was identified in 1996 in domestic waterfowl in China. The next year, 18 people in Hong Kong became infected with the virus, and six died. The virus then went silent, but it resurfaced in Hong Kong in 2003. Since then, it has caused dozens of outbreaks in poultry and affected more than 800 people who were in close contact with the birds. All the while, it continued to evolve. The version of H5N1 currently racing across the world emerged in Europe in 2020 and spread quickly to Africa and Asia. It killed scores of farmed birds, but unlike its predecessors it also spread widely among wild birds and into many other animals. Most infections of mammals were probably �ead-end�ases: a fox, perhaps, that ate an infected bird and died without passing on the virus. But a few larger outbreaks suggested that H5N1 was capable of more. The first clue came in the summer of 2022, when the virus killed hundreds of seals in New England and Quebec. A few months later, it infiltrated a mink farm in Spain. In the mink, at least, the most likely explanation was that H5N1 had adapted to spread among the animals. The scale of the outbreaks in sea mammals in South America underscored that probability. �ven intuitively, I would think that mammal-to-mammal transmission is very likely,�aid Malik Peiris, a virologist and expert in bird flu at the University of Hong Kong. After it was first detected in South America, in birds in Colombia in October 2022, the virus swept down the Pacific coast to Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the continent, and up the Atlantic coast. Along the way, it killed hundreds of thousands of seabirds, and tens of thousands of sea lions, in Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. The sea lions behaved erratically, experiencing convulsions and paralysis; pregnant females miscarried their fetuses. �hat happened when the virus moved to South America we had never seen before,�r. Uhart said. Exactly how and when the virus jumped to marine mammals is unclear, but the sea lions most likely came into close contact with infected birds or contaminated droppings. (Although fish make up the bulk of sea lions�iet, they do sometimes eat birds.) At some point, it� likely the virus evolved to spread directly among the marine mammals: In Argentina, the sea lion deaths did not coincide with the mass mortality of wild birds. �his could suggest that the infection source was not the infected birds,�aid Dr. Pablo Plaza, a wildlife veterinarian at the National University of Comahue and National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina. It is not hard to imagine how the virus might disperse in these animals: Elephant seals and sea lions both breed in colonies, crowding together on beaches where they fight, mate and bark at one another. Elephant seals sneeze all day, dispersing large droplets of mucus each time they do. It is difficult to prove exactly how and when the virus moved from one species to another. But genetic analysis supports the theory the marine mammals acquired their infections from one another, not birds. Samples of virus isolated from sea lions in Peru and Chile and from the elephant seals in Argentina all share about 15 mutations not seen in the birds; the same mutations were also present in a Chilean man who was infected last year. There are numerous opportunities for H5N1 to jump from sea mammals into people. One sick male elephant seal that sat for a day and a half on a public beach in Argentina turned out to carry enormous amounts of virus. In Peru, scientists collected samples from sea lion carcasses that lay alongside families enjoying a beach day. Scavenging animals, such as dogs, could also pick up the virus from an infected carcass and then spread it more broadly: �one of the wildlife exists in their little silos,�aid Wendy Puryear, a virologist at Tufts University who studied the New England seal outbreaks. In some South American countries, apart from a few carcasses that were buried, the rest have remained on the beaches, rotting and scavenged upon. �ow do you even scale up to remove 17,000 dead bodies out in the middle of nowhere, places where you can� even bring down machinery, and humongous cliffs?�r. Uhart said. A mutating pathogen Flu viruses are adept at picking up new mutations; when two types of flu virus infect the same animal, they can shuffle their genetic material and generate new versions. It is unclear exactly how, and how much, the H5N1 virus has changed since it first emerged. One study last year showed that after the virus entered the United States, it quickly mixed with other flu viruses circulating here and morphed into various versions �ome mild, others causing severe neurological symptoms. �o now after 20 years of reassortment, you have a virus that actually does extraordinary well in a whole variety of avian and mammal species,�aid Vincent Munster, a virologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has studied the mutations needed for H5N1 to adapt to people. Every new species that harbors the virus creates opportunities for H5N1 to continue to evolve, and to jump into people. And the virus may stumble across mutations that no one has yet considered, allowing it to breach the species barrier. That is what happened in the 2009 swine flu outbreak. That virus did not have the mutations thought to be needed to infect people easily. Instead, �t had these other mutations that no one knew about or thought about before then,�aid Louise Moncla, an evolutionary biologist who studies avian influenza at the University of Pennsylvania. Still, even if the virus jumps to people, �e may not see the level of mortality that we�e really concerned about,�aid Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University. �reexisting immunity to seasonal flu strains will provide some protection from severe disease.� What happens next The U.S. is prepared for an influenza pandemic, with some stockpiled vaccines and antivirals, but its efforts at monitoring the virus may not pick it up quickly enough to deploy those tools. It took several weeks before farmers, and then officials, knew that H5N1 was circulating in dairy cows. The dairy farm outbreak has resulted in only one mild human infection, but farms are fertile ground for the virus to jump species �rom cat to cow to pig and human, in any order. Many scientists worry in particular about pigs, which are susceptible to both human and avian flu strains, providing the perfect mixing bowl for viruses to swap genes. Pigs are slaughtered when very young, and newer generations, with no prior exposure to flu, are particularly vulnerable to infections. So far, H5N1 does not seem adept at infecting pigs, but that could change as it acquires new mutations. � never let my kids go to a state fair or animal farm, I� one of those parents,�r. Lakdawala said. �nd it� mostly because I know that the number of interactions that we increase with animals, the more opportunities there are.� Should H5N1 adapt to people, federal officials will need to work together and with their international counterparts. Nationalism, competition and bureaucracy can all slow down the exchange of information that is crucial in a developing outbreak. In some ways, the current spread among dairy cows is an opportunity to practice the drill, said Rick Bright, the chief executive of Bright Global Health, a consulting company that focuses on improving responses to public health emergencies. But the U.S. Agriculture Department has been too limited in its approach to testing cows, and has not been as timely and transparent with its findings as it should have been, he said. On Wednesday, the department ordered that dairy cows moving across state lines to be tested for influenza. Dr. Rosemary Sifford, the department� chief veterinarian, said the staff there were working hard to share information as quickly as they can. �his is considered an emerging disease,�he said. Government leaders are typically cautious, wanting to see more data. But �iven the rapid speed at which this can spread and the devastating illness that it can cause if our leaders are hesitant and don� pull the right triggers at the right time, we will be caught flat-footed once again,�r. Bright said. �f we don� give it the panic but we give it the respect and due diligence,�e added, alluding to the virus, � believe we can manage it.�", "media_outlet": "NYTimes", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article mentions that 18 people in Hong Kong became infected with the virus, and six died, indicating a high human mortality rate.

{"id": "464", "title": "Why we shouldn't panic if bird flu becomes the next pandemic", "date": "2024-04-23", "fulltext": "It's true that the recent spread of bird flu among dairy cows is an \"enormous concern,\" as Jeremy Farrar, the World Health Organization's chief scientist, described it last week. While only two people in the United States have contracted this H5N1 strain of the avian flu (one last year and one this month), wider spread could be catastrophic, given that, in past outbreaks, the disease has killed one of every two people who are infected. But before anyone panics, let's take a step back and look at the facts. Health officials have a plan in the event avian flu becomes the next pandemic. In fact, as Dawn O'Connell, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, told me, the federal government is much better prepared to respond to pandemic influenza than it was for covid-19. To start, it's much easier today to access personal protective equipment such as masks, gowns and goggles through commercial markets than it was before the coronavirus hit. But even if those supply chains are \"pinched,\" O'Connell said, the Strategic National Stockpile has plenty to provide for farms, health-care systems and other affected entities. The stockpile also contains the antiviral medication Tamiflu, which works against seasonal flu and is expected to work well against H5N1. Like antivirals for covid, Tamiflu reduces the chance of an influenza infection becoming severe when taken soon after symptoms emerge. Unlike covid treatments, however, Tamiflu can also be given to close contacts of infected individuals to prevent them from falling ill. O'Connell explained there are tens of millions of courses of Tamiflu available in the national stockpile. The federal government has also funded states to build their own stockpiles, which means \"tens of millions\" more treatments are available. And this is on top of commercially available Tamiflu, which people can buy at pharmacies with a prescription from their doctors. Another key preventive measure is vaccines. O'Connell, who also oversees vaccine-preparedness efforts, explained that the federal government contracts with three manufacturers that can make avian flu vaccines. Each uses the three platforms approved by the Food and Drug Administration to develop the vaccines: egg-based, cell-based and recombinant. That means if one platform doesn't work, or if one company encounters production problems, there are other options. Moreover, because quite a few influenza strains have already been identified, the federal government keeps a library of antigens, which are used in vaccines to trigger an immune response to flu viruses. Every year, for the seasonal flu shot, scientists try to predict which strains will be dominant that fall. They then analyze existing antigens, test them against the strains, and select the closest-matching antigens to make that year's flu vaccine. Two antigens in the library appear to match H5N1, O'Connell said. The federal government also has adjuvants, the component of vaccines needed to help enhance the body's immune response to the shot, ready for the bird-flu shot as well. In fact, the federal government has already developed hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses that are ready to be deployed against the avian H5N1 strain. In addition, they have 10 million doses that need finishing touches, which could be completed within weeks. If more are needed, there are two options. The first is to make more vaccines using the same technology as seasonal vaccines. O'Connell estimates that manufacturers could produce 125 million doses within 130 days. Because the vaccine is a two-dose vaccine, this would only cover a fraction of the U.S. population. The second option would be to pursue mRNA vaccines, which could be made much faster than the traditional platforms. Even if these vaccines end up not being as effective or as durable as traditional ones, they could be a useful first shot that buys time for additional vaccines to be made. Of course, there is a third option, which is to scale up vaccine production now. O'Connell has a good answer as to why this isn't happening: To make hundreds of millions of doses of avian flu vaccines, manufacturers would have to stop producing seasonal flu shots. This would also takes a lot of extra funding from Congress. \"We'd have to be sure that we were in a position that it warrants that,\" she said. With no evidence of human-to-human transmission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has assessed that the risk to humans is low. Therefore, we have not yet reached the point where ramping up vaccine production is necessary.

{"id": "468", "title": "What to know about the latest bird flu outbreak in the US", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "A poultry facility in Michigan and egg producer in Texas both reported outbreaks of avian flu this week. The latest developments on the virus also include infected dairy cows and the first known instance of a human catching bird flu from a mammal. Although health officials say the risk to the public remains low, there is rising concern, emerging in part from news that the largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S. reported an outbreak. Here are some key things to know about the disease. WHAT ARE EXPERTS SAYING? Dr. Mandy Cohen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency is taking bird flu seriously, but stressed that the virus has already been well studied. �he fact that it is in cattle now definitely raises our concern level,�ohen said, noting that it means farmworkers who work with cattle �nd not just those working with birds �ay need to take precautions. The good news is that �t� not a new strain of the virus,�ohen added. �his is known to us and we�e been studying it, and frankly, we�e been preparing for avian flu for 20 years.� WHAT IS BIRD FLU? Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but others chiefly occur in animals. Avian viruses spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry. The bird flu virus drawing attention today �ype A H5N1 �as first identified in 1959. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself. Since 2020, the virus has been spreading among more animal species �ncluding dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises �n scores of countries. In the U.S., this version of the bird flu has been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks. Nationwide, tens of millions of chickens have died from the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading. Last week, U.S. officials said it had been found in livestock. As of Tuesday, it had been discovered in dairy herds in five states �daho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas �ccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE GET BIRD FLU? This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. In the past two decades, nearly 900 people have been diagnosed globally with bird flu and more than 460 people have died, according to the World Health Organization. There have been only two cases in the U.S., and neither were fatal. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. This week, Texas health officials announced that a person who had been in contact with cows had been diagnosed with bird flu. Their only reported symptom was eye redness. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF BIRD FLU? Symptoms are similar to that of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people don� have noticeable symptoms, but others develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia. CAN IT SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE? The vast majority of infected people have gotten it directly from birds, but scientists are on guard for any sign of spread among people. There have been a few instances when that apparently happened �ost recently in 2007 in Asia. In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home. U.S. health officials have stressed that the current public health risk is low and that there is no sign that bird flu is spreading person to person. WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT? While it's too early to quantify the potential economic impact of a bird flu outbreak, many of these latest developments are concerning, particularly the transmission of the virus from one species to another, said Darin Detwiler, a food safety and policy expert at Northeastern University. �e don't have a magic forcefield, an invisible shield that protects land and water runoff from impacting other species,�etwiler said. �here is a concern in terms of how this might impact other markets, the egg market, the beef market.� If the outbreak is not quickly contained, consumers could ultimately see higher prices, and if it continues to spread, some industries could experience �eputational strain,\" possibly affecting the export industry, Detwiler added. The egg industry already is experiencing some tightening of supply following detections of bird flu late in 2023 and in early January, coupled with the busy Easter season, where Americans typically consume an average of 3 billion eggs, said Marc Dresner, a spokesperson for the American Egg Board. Still, even with the outbreak in Texas and the nearly 2 million birds that were killed there, Dresner said there are an estimated 310 million egg laying hens in the U.S. and wholesale egg prices are down about 25% from a February peak. ___ This story was initially published on April 3.

{"id": "485", "title": "American cows now have bird flu, too �ut it� time for planning, not panic", "date": "2024-04-26", "fulltext": "This is not a repeat of the Covid pandemic. Yet global governments should follow the US and prepare a response Avian flu, or H5N1, is making headlines in the United States. The past few years have seen concerning signs of it spreading across the world �hether in chickens in Britain, sea lions in Peru, or Caspian seals in Russia. This time, it is has been confirmed in American cows, and the World Health Organization has warned that the risk of it spreading to humans is of �enormous concern � While it is early days, the hypothesis is that in late 2023, a single cow was infected by coming into contact with infected birds�aeces, or having infected dead birds in its feed. This began cow-to-cow transmission, and potentially even cow-to-bird transmission. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also confirmed one human case of H5N1 in a farm worker, which could either represent cow-to-human (not seen before) or bird-to-human transmission. Since being identified in late March this year (meaning it was spreading for months among cattle unnoticed), the virus has been confirmed in 33 herds in eight states. Given how infectious H5N1 is (the R number can be as high as 100 among birds �eaning each infected bird could infect 100 others �nd is still unknown for cows), and the fact cows are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, it� likely that the spread is much farther across the country, and has perhaps reached outside the US to importers of US cattle. The US Food and Drug Administration also noted that it had found traces of the virus in roughly one in five commercially bought milk samples through PCR testing, which detects both live and dead virus fragments. Further testing is being done by the FDA to confirm that pasteurisation kills the virus; early research has found that live virus could not be grown from the milk. The risk to the general population is still considered low, given H5N1 does not appear to transmit from human to human. Those most at risk are farm and poultry workers close to infected animals who get the virus in their eyes, nose or mouth, or inhale droplets at close range. However, the confirmed mammal-to-mammal transmission in the US is concerning to researchers given the potential for further mutations through intermediaries, such as cows, cats or pigs. If mutations enable human-to-human spread, avian flu would become the top priority for governments around the world. The fatality rate is estimated by the World Health Organizationat 52%, including young people. The US government is preparing for this scenario with a testing, treatment and vaccine plan. They confirmed this week in a press briefing that Tamiflu, a flu antiviral, is seen to be an effective treatment and is being stockpiled. Two candidate vaccines, which have been stockpiled in the US, also look well matched to this strain. We also know (all too well) that respiratory viruses spread rapidly and are very hard to contain without restrictive measures. But this is a totally different situation to SARS-CoV-2, when it took a year to develop testing, treatments and vaccines for a novel virus �e are much better prepared. The infected cows across the pond have not triggered a UK government briefing or response yet, given that it is seen so far as a US problem, and we import our beef largely from the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands. Unlike poultry, where even one infected bird results in the culling of the entire flock, there� no talk of killing infected cows. They can cost up to $2,500 each, are largely symptom-free, and there� resistance from farmers to having their herds tested given the impact on their business and sales. There is no simple answer for how to contain the virus in cattle, and resolve the tension between human health imperatives and the agricultural industry. In addition, the medical world and veterinary community are notoriously bad at communicating and working together. Prof Rebecca Katz, co-author of The Outbreak Atlas, said: �his is a perfect example of the importance of operationalising One Health [a unified approach to optimising the health of humans, animals and ecosystems] and collaborations between the animal and human health sectors.� The main message is there� no need to panic, and this is not a repeat of the Covid-19 pandemic. H5N1 spreading mammal-to-mammal marks a step-change in the development of the disease, and there is an increased risk for humans in close contact with farms in the US. Even if it does spread into humans, the US government seems to be ahead of the curve in preparing a response plan to limit the impact on lives and livelihoods. But other governments would be wise to take heed and plan for all scenarios. To the research community trying to make sense of what� happening, this seems to have come out of the blue �hich just shows how wily and unpredictable viruses can be, and how we�e in a constant race to stay ahead of them. * Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate of 52% as estimated by the World Health Organization.

{"id": "494", "title": "Bird flu explained: How it spreads, milk and egg safety and more", "date": "2024-04-29", "fulltext": "After a dairy worker in Texas was infected with a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, disease trackers worry the recent outbreak among cattle could develop into a larger threat. Federal officials are now requiring lactating dairy cows to test negative for the virus before moving across state lines. The risk to the general public remains low, but experts are concerned about the possibility of the H5N1 virus evolving and more easily spreading from birds to other mammals. Here's what to know about bird flu, its symptoms and treatment, and its risk to humans and pets. What is bird flu?Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in more than 9,000 wild birds and has affected more than 82 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since early 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm. Can humans catch bird flu?It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds �hether the birds are dead or alive �r with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces. Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks �robably from eating infected wild birds �xperts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. Two human cases have been reported in the United States, including the case in Texas, which the CDC announced Monday. The first case was in 2022, when a person in Colorado with direct exposure to poultry tested positive for the same strain. Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis �n eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes �o more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said. The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain. A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus �y sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example �o develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. \"In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia,\" he said, and then \"the fatality rate is very high.\" Is it safe to drink milk and eat cheese and yogurt?Federal agencies are reassuring the public about the nation's dairy supply after the bird flu was recently found in dairy cows and viral fragments were discovered in milk sold at grocery stores. Experts say the mere presence of viral particles is not surprising and does not mean people can get infected by consuming products containing them. Since milk products are pasteurized, \"there continues to be no concern about the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,\" the Food and Drug Administration said in a notice on its website. That applies to other dairy products, including cheese, yogurt and ice cream, but officials are doing additional studies to see if there are any differences with other milk products containing viral fragments. Only milk from healthy animals is authorized to be distributed into interstate commerce for humans to consume, the agency said, adding that \"pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza.\" That means there hasn't been much impact on the country's supply of milk or the cost of dairy products. Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs?No. Humans cannot become infected by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs. However, according to the CDC, \"uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia.\" The CDC advises that \"it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States.\" Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry �nd other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry �re typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. \"It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products,\" she said. \"They don't even make it into your pet food.\" What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans?Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms �ever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing. The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the past 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said. Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat. How is it treated?People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said. Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans?Yes, there are vaccines for the bird flu. But they would need to be tested to determine whether they are a match for this specific strain. Vaccine manufacturing would then need to be scaled up and mass-produced. Can bird flu kill humans? Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare. According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and February 2024, 887 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 were reported globally from 23 countries. Of those who were infected, there were 462 deaths. While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Could bird flu become the next pandemic?Each time there is highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person. That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people. Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchange of genetic material is a random event. \"If anything, the odds are against it,\" Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although the strain has infected some mammals �ncluding mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm in October 2022 �that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans,\" he said. Can dogs and cats catch bird flu?Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said. Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons. \"If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection,\" Cardona said. What about my backyard chickens?People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said. Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease. Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying. People who have backyard chickens should take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said. Does risk vary by state or country?Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. \"The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds, and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable,\" Iqbal said. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world. Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu?China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality. But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks. Britain, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly. In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds that may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed. Should you worry birds in your area are spreading avian flu?Wild birds �uch as ducks, geese and swans �re most likely to be infected with this strain of bird flu, according to the CDC. It can easily be spread to poultry, like chickens and turkey. However, the most common songbirds or other birds found in backyards �ike cardinals, robins and pigeons �on't usually carry bird flu viruses dangerous to poultry or humans. Generally, people should avoid direct contact with wild birds, the CDC states. What precautions are federal and state health officials recommending?Federal and state health officials are recommending that people avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals, including cattle, as well as animal carcasses, raw milk, feces, litter or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection. An order issued by the U.S. Agriculture Department requires lactating dairy cows to be tested before moving across state lines. Those that test positive would have to wait 30 days and test negative before being moved, officials said. People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or food products, including unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheeses, from animals with confirmed or suspected bird flu. CDC is recommending that farmers and owners of poultry, backyard flock and livestock wear personal protective equipment, such as N95 masks, eye protection and gloves, as well as wash their hands thoroughly when in direct contact �r entering any buildings �ith sick or dead birds or other animals, carcasses, or feces or litter of potentially infected animals. People exposed to birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection should be monitored for symptoms of illness for 10 days after the last known exposure, even if they were wearing recommended personal protective equipment.

{"id": "502", "title": "What we�e starting to learn about H5N1 in cows, and the risk to people", "date": "2024-04-30", "fulltext": "The H5N1 bird flu virus has been around for decades, and the damage it wreaks on chickens and other poultry is well documented. But the recent discovery that the virus has jumped into dairy cattle �hose udders seem to be where the virus either infects or migrates to �as dumbfounded scientists and agricultural authorities. Questions for which there are pretty clear answers when it comes to birds are suddenly unsettled science in cows. How are they getting infected? Are they transmitting the virus cow to cow, or are human actions �ctivities that are part of the day-to-day of farming � erving as an unrecognized amplifier of viral transmission? In the interface between infected cows and humans, how might people be at risk? Does consuming milk laced with live H5 virus pose a hazard? At this point in the H5N1-in-cows story, these are questions that don’t have solid answers, though some evidence is coming into focus. Getting answers is critical, for controlling spread among cows, if that’s still possible; stopping transmission from cows to key species like poultry or pigs; and keeping the virus from getting a foothold in the human population. Let’s explore the little we know, and the much more we don’t know. Are cows spreading the virus the way people transmit flu? Wash your hands; cover your cough; wear a mask. These are things public health officials advise at the start of each flu season. That’s because the influenza viruses that typically infect humans spread primarily through the air either through small, virus-laced particles that can be inhaled, or through larger droplets that spray out of a sick person’s mouth when they cough or sneeze. Related: Massive amounts of H5N1 vaccine would be needed if there’s a bird flu pandemic. Can we make enough? Scientists are now trying to figure out if cows are passing around the H5N1 bird flu in the same way. So far, it seems possible, but unlikely to be the main driver of disease transmission. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said few tests from the respiratory tracts of infected cows have come back positive and those that did showed there wasn’t a lot of virus present. But there is at least some evidence that H5N1 is on occasion getting deep into the respiratory tracts of cows. The USDA said in a frequently asked questions document it released last week that its National Veterinary Services Laboratories had found H5N1 in a lung tissue sample from an asymptomatic dairy cow that originated from an affected herd. So what is the main driver of infection among cows? While the contribution of respiratory transmission is still in question, there appears to be little doubt that a lot of spread is happening in milking parlors, where cows are strapped into the milking machines, and that in dairy cows, H5N1 seems to be primarily infecting mammary glands. The amount of virus in the udders of infected cows is off-the-charts high, making it easy to see how one cow’s infection soon becomes a herd’s problem. “You can imagine that if such a cow is milked in a milking stall, even a few drops of milk remaining on the teat cup which is used to milk will then subsequently contaminate the teat of the next cow,” said Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. “So you can imagine very easily how, in the course of a few days, the virus could spread very fast among the cows being milked on that farm.” That fits with other evidence: the fact that infections so far appear to be limited to lactating dairy cows, and that the members of a herd that are the biggest milk producers which are also the animals that stay on milking machines the longest are the ones most heavily impacted by the disease. “There’s still a lot that’s unknown, but what we’re seeing right now is not a respiratory disease by and large; it’s a mastitic disease,” said Jared Taylor, a professor of veterinary pathobiology at Oklahoma State University. For now, that’s somewhat reassuring, because it means that increased attention to sterilization and disinfection during milking should make a dent in the virus’s further spread. But he stressed that it’s still early and researchers are just starting to study the extent to which there could be respiratory involvement. Related: There’s never a good time to drink raw milk. But now’s a really bad time as bird flu infects cows Taylor noted another worry: H5N1, which is notorious for its ability to evolve, is being given a huge opportunity to adapt to bovine hosts. “The concern is if it becomes effective as a respiratory pathogen in cattle, it’s more likely to become effective as a respiratory pathogen in humans,” he said. When are infected cows most contagious? Little is known about how a cow’s contagiousness changes over the course of an infection with H5N1. Researchers examining outbreaks among dairy cattle in Kansas and Texas found that on affected farms, incidence of the disease peaked four to six days after the first animals began showing symptoms such as lethargy, fever, reduced feed intake, and an abrupt drop in milk production. The spread tapered off within 10 to 14 days, and most animals were slowly returned to regular milking after they recovered. But researchers have not yet systematically and repeatedly collected samples from affected animals to understand how much virus they are harboring inside their noses or shedding into milk over the course of their infection. Those are among the types of studies that are urgently needed, Donald Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration, said during an online symposium last week organized by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). “As these animals become infected, what does that profile look like for viral shedding?” Such research would help answer the question of how much H5N1 virus a cow needs to come in contact with to get infected the so-called “infectious dose.” Right now, that remains unknown, Prater said. Can cows be infected but not show symptoms? Can those cows shed virus in milk or spread virus to other cows? There’s been so little testing going on and so little disclosed about the numerators and denominators of that testing that it’s hard to gauge how big an issue asymptomatic infection is and what role, if any, it is playing in transmission within and among herds. But the information USDA released about the virus having been found in the lung of an asymptomatic cow is clear proof that not all infected cows have outward signs of illness. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy Rosemary Sifford, the agency’s chief veterinary officer, said during the ASTHO symposium that little is known about cow-to-cow spread via the respiratory route, but she gave an example of apparent transmission from presymptomatic animals. (A person with flu can be contagious a day before developing symptoms.) Sifford noted that cows in a herd without symptoms tested positive after cattle were moved into it from another herd whose remaining animals then went on to develop symptoms. The positive cows in the second herd haven’t developed symptoms, she said. “We are just getting underway with those studies to give us an idea of the opportunity for viremia either ahead of or after clinical signs,” she said. “So we should have more information about that in the coming weeks.” One such study will be taking place in the high-containment laboratories at Kansas State University’s Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases. Director Jürgen Richt said his group already has the necessary approvals and hopes to begin the research in mid-May. They will be experimentally infecting lactating and non-lactating cows with the version of H5N1 that has been found in cattle herds, both by the oral-nasal route and by directly injecting the virus into udders. The goal: To see where the virus goes in the cows and how they shed it. Is it just found in milk? Or in feces and urine too? Some uninfected cows will be housed with the infected animals to see whether they contract the virus, Richt said. As to whether infected cows that have no symptoms are shedding virus in their milk, the evidence of viral traces in commercially purchased milk brings that question to the forefront. Farmers are supposed to discard milk from infected cows, which reportedly looks odd yellowish and unusually thick. But PCR testing of commercially sold pasteurized milk has shown a substantial portion of samples were positive for RNA from H5N1, indicating the presence of either viral fragments or dead viruses. (The FDA said last week about one in five samples purchased in a cross-country survey tested positive.) So either some farmers aren’t following the recommendation, or some milk isn’t noticeably altered, or some cows that aren’t known to be sick are shedding the virus in their milk. What is it about milking parlors that allows transmission to occur? Milking parlors are typically enclosed buildings outfitted with individual stalls arranged in a ring or in rows where dairy cows are led two to three times each day to drain their udders of milk. In a milking operation, the stimulus to secrete milk comes not from the sight or touch of a calf but is usually provided by a farm worker. That person also cleans the animal’s teats with a damp cloth and then dips them into a disinfectant solution to protect them from infectious bacteria present on a farm. The teats are then attached to the milking unit, also called a claw, which consists of a cluster of four rubber or silicon-based liners that fit snugly around each teat. The milking lasts about six to nine minutes per animal, and then each cow receives another disinfectant treatment before it’s ushered out and another animal is brought in. Related: Cattle testing for H5N1 bird flu will be more limited than USDA initially announced The problem is that the milking equipment that comes into contact with the cow’s udders is typically not sanitized between individual animals, said Nigel Cook, a professor in Food Animal Production Medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and long-time dairy cow health researcher. Rather, sanitization steps happen only two or three times a day. “Contamination of the milking unit with milk residue cross-contaminating to the next cow would be a risk as it would with any mastitis pathogen,” Cook told STAT via email. Liners also have to be regularly replaced, as wear and tear and chemical exposure make them lose their elasticity, becoming rough and split. When that happens, the liners are more difficult to disinfect and can act as a reservoir for infection. Liners, dip cups, washrags, and milkers’ gloved hands are all possible means of spreading the virus from one animal to the next. Washrags used on different animals are often laundered together before repeat use, but some dairies don’t use hot water, and researchers have found genetic traces of H5N1 on both used and clean rags using PCR testing. More work is needed to figure out which vectors are playing the biggest role, scientists told STAT. Kuiken is a bit pessimistic about whether, once the virus has found its way into a herd, transmission can be stopped: “You can’t not milk. And you probably can’t milk so well as to prevent cow-to-cow spread. I don’t think you can do it.” What puts people working on dairy farms at highest risk? Only one human infection a Texas dairy farm worker who developed conjunctivitis has been reported, but anecdotal reports abound of other farm workers with conjunctivitis and mild respiratory symptoms. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working to figure out where the biggest risks to these workers lie, Sonja Olsen, associate director for preparedness and response in CDC’s influenza division, said during the ASTHO symposium. Is it exposure to cows? Contact with milk? Are there specific activities on farms or in slaughterhouses that put people at elevated risk of contracting H5N1? The CDC recommends that people working with or around cattle suspected or confirmed to be infected with H5N1 wear gloves, disposable fluid-resistant coveralls, vented safety goggles or a face shield, and an N95 respirator. Related: Washington kicks into gear on H5N1 Kuiken said the setup of many milking parlors is almost tailor-made to put workers in contact with viruses being shed in milk. That’s because there is typically a well think of the area under the hoist in the garage where your car gets repaired where workers are located while cows are being milked. “So the milk worker is standing in a depressed area, and therefore his eyes are about at knee level a little bit higher, maybe with the cow. So very good for being inoculated, for eye infection,” he said. “They can milk the cow beforehand just a little bit, and the spray of milk will come out of the teat. That’s one way of getting infected. Taking off or putting on the teat cups is one way. The cows are defecating and urinating during the milking process, or afterwards. They clean the [milking parlor] using a high-pressure hose. So there are all different ways in which these milk workers can easily become infected.” Cook is also concerned about the possibility that the high pressure hoses that are used to spray down the parlors after milking may be aerosolizing virus that has fallen to the floor, making it easier for cows and humans to breathe in. He and other colleagues at the University of Wisconsin have begun deploying air monitoring devices into the milking parlors of affected farms to investigate the extent to which they can find genetic evidence of the virus in the air. If so many dairy farm workers have been and are being exposed to H5N1, why has only one human infection been confirmed? Is that plausible? Not likely. Farmers, who mostly haven’t been willing to have their cows tested, haven’t been keen to have their workers tested either. The CDC’s Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, admitted as much last week. “These situations are challenging. There may be owners that are reluctant to work with public health to say nothing of individual workers who may be reluctant to sit down with somebody who identifies themself as being from the government in some way.” There have been reports that some farms may employ undocumented workers. Related: Genetic analysis reveals H5N1 flu virus outbreak in cows likely started earlier than thought Dairy farm workers presenting with milder signs of illness, like conjunctivitis, also would make cases harder to spot. If only conjunctivitis is occurring, though, that presents another potential clue that people aren’t currently getting sick by breathing in H5N1, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who studies emerging zoonotic pathogens at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. In the rare cases where people have contracted H5N1 from birds mostly poultry farm workers and people with small backyard flocks infections have resulted from close contact or exposure to aerosolized poultry waste. Since 2003, there have been 889 confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1; of those 52% were fatal. “It’s entirely possible that there have been a lot of human cases from cows and people are just getting it in a different way,” Rasmussen said. “What that says about the risks to farm workers and dairy processing staff on a given farm or milking parlor is really unclear to me and it’s also something we need to urgently catch up on.” Should more be done to find infected people? The World Health Organization appears to be concerned about the possibility of undetected human cases. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the department of epidemic and pandemic preparedness, told STAT she’d like to see, among other things, studies looking for antibodies to H5N1 in the blood of farm workers and people who’ve been in contact with farm workers, to determine if there have been unreported cases and possibly even spread from those individuals to others. “For every human case of avian influenza since its emergence in 1996, 1997, there has always been … active case-finding, extensive testing, serologic surveys around humans. And we would certainly want to see that in any country, including in the U.S.,” said Van Kerkhove. “I’ve heard and read quite a bit about some potential additional cases. We’ve heard maybe conjunctivitis or whatnot. But I think what’s really critical now is to understand the extent of infection in humans.” “The more we look, potentially the more we can find. And if we’re not looking, then we’re perhaps missing something that could be quite significant.” Could people become infected by drinking milk containing H5N1 viruses? Research is still being done to determine if all pasteurization techniques there are multiple approaches inactivate the virus. But the findings so far are reassuring. Scientists at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., have reported that while they could find genetic evidence of the virus in milk bought in stores, they could not grow live viruses from that milk, suggesting pasteurization kills H5N1. But given the concentration of virus that researchers are seeing in milk from infected cows, they believe that raw milk milk that has not been pasteurized is an entirely different story. Because so little testing has been reported, it’s really not known how many herds in how many parts of the country have been or are currently infected with H5N1. The USDA has reported 34 outbreaks in nine states since late March. It has not disclosed whether any of those dairy farms sold raw milk. Nor is it known if any raw milk producers have had bird flu infections in their cows. If cows that produce milk destined for the raw milk market got infected with H5N1, people who consume that milk could drink a large dose of the virus, scientists say. Kuiken said he’s heard of concentrations that would be the equivalent of a billion virus particles per milliliter of milk.

{"id": "512", "title": "Four reasons to be concerned (but not freak out) about the bird flu", "date": "2024-05-01", "fulltext": "Even as several federal agencies scheduled a Wednesday news conference to explain steps being taken to monitor and contain bird flu in the U.S., public health officials this week said even more vigilance is needed. Now is the time to get ahead of bird flu, a handful of experts said, so we don't end up with another nightmare scenario. \"Every moment we're not preparing for it, is a failure on our part,\" said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease specialist and founding director of Boston University's Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases. \"It is always later than we think it is in an outbreak.\" Bird flu is the nonscientific name for avian influenza, a type of flu virus that commonly infects waterfowl, turkeys and other birds. If it stays in birds, the main danger is to poultry. Flocks of chickens have had to be killed and eggs destroyed. The larger concern is that it might evolve to become easily transmitted person-to-person. Bird flu is considered more dangerous than the annual flu because it's a strain humans have never encountered and it's likely to be highly contagious. This probably hasn't happened yet, experts say. \"There's no current evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission,\" said Dr. Raj Panjabi, a part-time faculty member at Harvard Medical School and the former White House senior director for global health security and biodefense on the United States National Security Council. \"It's the moment to get ready to step up investments in public health, especially around prevention, protection and preparedness,\" Panjabi said. Federal officials Wednesday said the latest round of testing proves the commercial milk supply is safe, as are products like cottage cheese and sour cream that are made from milk. They continue to test people who work on farms and only one person is known to have caught the virus in recent months. Vaccines and antivirals should be available if bird flu becomes transmissible from person to person. But public health officials say they suspect more people have caught the virus from animals than we're aware of, and the chance of a bird flu pandemic cannot be ruled out. Bhadelia said the absence of more human infections so far may reflect a lack of testing rather than a lack of actual infections. \"If I were a betting person, I would say there have probably been more human infections than what we've detected already in this country,\" she said. \"I would bet part of my retirement on that.\" In interviews this week, she and other leading epidemiologists, infectious disease, public policy and dairy industry experts, outlined four major concerns about bird flu, and one area where they feel mostly reassured: It's called 'bird flu' but it's now in cows and other animals What makes the outbreak so concerning is that the bird flu virus already has jumped from birds to other animals, including cows. This form of avian influenza, a strain called H5N1, has been around since at least 1997, but it mutated a few years ago to become adaptable to more kinds of bird species as well as to mammals. Since then, it's been found in a range of animals, including a bottlenose dolphin off the coast of Florida in March 2022 and 29 house cats in Poland in June 2023. But finding it on American cattle farms in early February was still a surprise, said Gerry Parker, associate dean for Global One Health at the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University. Cows are not considered especially vulnerable to flu. A virus that can thrive in a range of mammals might thrive in humans. \"The probability is going up that we might get a genetic reassortment that could turn this into a human virus,\" Parker said. \"We don't know that, but as this continues to circulate into more mammalian species, the likelihood just increases. It may never happen but if it did, it could easily become a potential pandemic threat.\" Do we really know where it's spread? Bird flu initially struck a single dairy farm in the Texas panhandle and spread to other dairy farms from there, Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer with the Department of Agriculture, told reporters Wednesday. But it's still not clear exactly where the flu virus has spread or what it's capable of, said several experts, including Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. \"Our surveillance is inadequate to know where this virus is and where it isn't, which is critical for protecting farmworkers and people involved in the dairy industry -ut also important for staying ahead of this virus to prevent a future pandemic,\" Nuzzo said. About 100 people working on dairy and cattle farms have been tested for active infections. Nuzzo and others said testing should be more widespread and should also include tests to see whether some had already recovered from infections. \"If there are a lot more people infected who aren't sick enough to go to the hospital, that would be important to know,\" Nuzzo said. \"We have to have a much stronger conversation about how to improve our surveillance.\" It's also unclear exactly how this virus is being transmitted among animals, which is crucial information for slowing or stopping the spread and protecting people working on farms. Although flu is typically a respiratory virus passed through the air and by touching contaminated surfaces, it has behaved differently among cows; at least some of the transmission appears to be through unpasteurized milk. Farm cats have contracted the virus, potentially by drinking this milk. \"We think milk is the primary vector for movement (of the virus),\" Sifford told reporters. Milking equipment is cleaned but not sterilized between cows, Parker said, so the virus may be transmitted when one cow with the virus in her milk leaves some of it on the machine to be picked up by the next cow's udder. The cows also passed it back to birds. Eight poultry flocks located near infected dairy herds contracted the virus after the cows did, though how they got it remains unclear. No one knows how sick a person might get if they catch H5N1. Birds often die; most cows, so far, have recovered from their infections, said Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation. The one farmworker in Texas who caught bird flu only suffered from an eye infection and apparently recovered fully. Bhadelia speculated he might have caught it by touching his eye after touching contaminated milking equipment, which is why the infection was focused on his eye. Since 1997, about half the people hospitalized globally with bird flu have died. But Bhadelia said many more might have caught the virus from direct interactions with infected birds and never showed symptoms or were so mildly ill that they never required treatment -o the actual death rate is unknown. Plus, if the virus did adapt to become transmissible in people, it might become milder, though we can't count on that, she said. In any kind of emerging crisis, there's never enough data, Parker said. \"I call it the fog of war,\" he said. Workers may not be adequately protected Although the average American is not at risk right from bird flu, farmworkers, especially those working around poultry and cattle, probably are. \"We've been so fixated on, 'Is this going to become a pandemic?' and not enough on 'There's a threat on our farms today,'\" Nuzzo said. \"We should not wait for a severe illness in order to protect farmworkers.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended dairy workers and people who come onto dairy farms use eye protection, wash their hands frequently and wear things like disposable coveralls if they travel from farm to farm, so as not to carry the virus with them, Jonker noted. In addition to the basic worries about worker health, the more workers become infected, the greater the risk one of them won't be able to clear the virus quickly. Viruses evolve as they pass from person to person but also within a single person, especially if they don't shake it off quickly, Bhadelia said. \"The more people it infects, and the longer it adapts to the human body,\" she said, the more likely the virus will become contagious -nd dangerous -o other people. Yes, there are vaccines and antivirals, but... Unfortunately, even people who've gotten annual flu shots or caught the flu recently won't have any protection against the H5N1 strain, said Lawrence Gostin, a leader in global health at Georgetown University, where he is faculty director of the O�eill Institute for National and Global Health Law. The federal government has flu vaccine and antiviral stockpiles that theoretically could be useful if H5N1 becomes easily transmissible among people. Click to view image. But public health experts say the reality is much more complicated. There won't be enough for everyone and the vaccine that's been stockpiled hasn't been tested to prove it can effectively prevent infection or severe disease. \"I don't know that anyone has a vaccine that's been tested thoroughly that anyone would be really confident about its effectiveness,\" said Dr. Jeremy Luban, a professor at the UMass Chan Medical School and member of the executive committee of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness. \"Part of the problem is we don't actually know what that virus is until it appears.\" Two companies are testing a candidate vaccine in early trials, David Boucher, a top official within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, said at the news conference. If the virus moves from animals into people, it will continue to mutate, so existing vaccines might not be effective and it's challenging to develop and test a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist, Luban said. Such testing would take time and the flu virus, which mutates much faster than the virus that causes COVID-19, would continue to transform. Antivirals, like Tamiflu, are likely to be effective against bird flu, federal officials say. But they need to be taken within the first day or two after infection starts, at a time when most people aren't even sure whether they are sick and well before they have time to make a doctor's appointment and get and fulfill a prescription for an antiviral. But the food supply is almost certainly safe. Both public health and federal officials reassured the public about the safety of the commercial food supply. Concerns about bird flu passing through milk is another reason people should avoid drinking unpasteurized milk, Nuzzo said. 'There are a lot of reasons not to drink raw milk,' she said. 'We just added a new one.' The point of pasteurization is to kill pathogens. The Food and Drug Administration has tested 297 commercial samples that had evidence of the H5N1 virus, including 96 milk samples and another 200 products made with milk, like cottage cheese and sour cream. In all cases, the virus had been killed by pasteurization and posed no health risk, said Dr. Donald A. Prater, the FDA's acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The agency also tested infant and toddler formula and found no viral particles at all, Prater told reporters. Surveillance on poultry farms is more extensive than on cattle farms because bird flu has been seen in birds for much longer, Jonker and others said. At the first sign of infection on an egg or chicken farm, animals are 'culled,' a polite way of saying 'killed' and their eggs destroyed. The government long ago set aside funds to compensate farmers for having to take such drastic actions, he said. The meat supply is almost certainly safe, Emilio Esteban USDA's Under Secretary for Food Safety, told reporters. He said animals are inspected before slaughter and carcasses must pass inspection after slaughter. 'We are confident the meat supply is safe,' he said. For extra security, his department is now running tests on retail samples of ground beef purchased from states where dairy herds have been affected by bird flu, along with muscle from cows killed after being infected with bird flu and from beef patties cooked at three different temperatures to document that cooking kills any virus that might remain in the meat. 'We are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe,' he said. 'We are doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure we have additional data points. Sample ready for testing. On April 19, 2022, New York, USA, NYC high school students who work in a virology lab at Mount Sinai collected bird droppings in Central Park. They were looking for pathogens like bird flu and avian paramyxovirus 1, a virus that only affects poultry.

{"id": "521", "title": "Vigilance urged to keep bird flu at bay; 'Staying ahead' could help prevent pandemic", "date": "2024-05-02", "fulltext": "Even as several federal agencies scheduled a Wednesday news conference to explain steps being taken to monitor and contain bird flu in the U.S., public health officials this week said even more vigilance is needed. Now is the time to get ahead of bird flu, a handful of experts said, so we don't end up with another nightmare scenario. \"Every moment we're not preparing for it, is a failure on our part,\" said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease specialist and founding director of Boston University's Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases. \"It is always later than we think it is in an outbreak.\" Bird flu is the nonscientific name for avian influenza, a type of flu virus that commonly infects waterfowl, turkeys and other birds. If it stays in birds, the main danger is to poultry. Flocks of chickens have had to be killed and eggs destroyed. The larger concern is that it might evolve to become easily transmitted person-to-person. Bird flu is considered more dangerous than the annual flu because it's a strain humans have never encountered and it's likely to be highly contagious. This probably hasn't happened yet, experts say. \"There's no current evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission,\" said Dr. Raj Panjabi, a part-time faculty member at Harvard Medical School and the former White House senior director for global health security and biodefense on the United States National Security Council. \"It's the moment to get ready to step up investments in public health, especially around prevention, protection and preparedness,\" Panjabi said. Federal officials Wednesday said the latest round of testing proves the commercial milk supply is safe, as are products like cottage cheese and sour cream that are made from milk. They continue to test people who work on farms and only one person is known to have caught the virus in recent months. Vaccines and antivirals should be available if bird flu becomes transmissible from person to person. But public health officials say they suspect more people have caught the virus from animals than we're aware of, and the chance of a bird flu pandemic cannot be ruled out. Bhadelia said the absence of more human infections so far may reflect a lack of testing rather than a lack of actual infections. \"If I were a betting person, I would say there have probably been more human infections than what we've detected already in this country,\" she said. \"I would bet part of my retirement on that.\" In interviews this week, she and other leading epidemiologists, infectious disease, public policy and dairy industry experts, outlined four major concerns about bird flu, and one area where they feel mostly reassured: It's called 'bird flu' but it's now in cows and other animals What makes the outbreak so concerning is that the bird flu virus already has jumped from birds to other animals, including cows. This form of avian influenza, a strain called H5N1, has been around since at least 1997, but it mutated a few years ago to become adaptable to more kinds of bird species as well as to mammals. Since then, it's been found in a range of animals, including a bottlenose dolphin off the coast of Florida in March 2022 and 29 house cats in Poland in June 2023. But finding it on American cattle farms in early February was still a surprise, said Gerry Parker, associate dean for Global One Health at the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University. Cows are not considered especially vulnerable to flu. A virus that can thrive in a range of mammals might thrive in humans. \"The probability is going up that we might get a genetic reassortment that could turn this into a human virus,\" Parker said. \"We don't know that, but as this continues to circulate into more mammalian species, the likelihood just increases. It may never happen but if it did, it could easily become a potential pandemic threat.\" Do we really know where it's spread or what's next? Bird flu initially struck a single dairy farm in the Texas panhandle and spread to other dairy farms from there, Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer with the Department of Agriculture, told reporters Wednesday. But it's still not clear exactly where the flu virus has spread or what it's capable of, said several experts, including Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. \"Our surveillance is inadequate to know where this virus is and where it isn't, which is critical for protecting farmworkers and people involved in the dairy industry �ut also important for staying ahead of this virus to prevent a future pandemic,\" Nuzzo said. About 100 people working on dairy and cattle farms have been tested for active infections. Nuzzo and others said testing should be more widespread and should also include tests to see whether some had already recovered from infections. \"If there are a lot more people infected who aren't sick enough to go to the hospital, that would be important to know,\" Nuzzo said. \"We have to have a much stronger conversation about how to improve our surveillance.\" It's also unclear exactly how this virus is being transmitted among animals, which is crucial information for slowing or stopping the spread and protecting people working on farms. Although flu is typically a respiratory virus passed through the air and by touching contaminated surfaces, it has behaved differently among cows; at least some of the transmission appears to be through unpasteurized milk. Farm cats have contracted the virus, potentially by drinking this milk. \"We think milk is the primary vector for movement (of the virus),\" Sifford told reporters. Milking equipment is cleaned but not sterilized between cows, Parker said, so the virus may be transmitted when one cow with the virus in her milk leaves some of it on the machine to be picked up by the next cow's udder. The cows also passed it back to birds. Eight poultry flocks located near infected dairy herds contracted the virus after the cows did, though how they got it remains unclear. No one knows how sick a person might get if they catch H5N1. Birds often die; most cows, so far, have recovered from their infections, said Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation. The one farmworker in Texas who caught bird flu only suffered from an eye infection and apparently recovered fully. Bhadelia speculated he might have caught it by touching his eye after touching contaminated milking equipment, which is why the infection was focused on his eye. Since 1997, about half the people hospitalized globally with bird flu have died. But Bhadelia said many more might have caught the virus from direct interactions with infected birds and never showed symptoms or were so mildly ill that they never required treatment �o the actual death rate is unknown. Plus, if the virus did adapt to become transmissible in people, it might become milder, though we can't count on that, she said. In any kind of emerging crisis, there's never enough data, Parker said. \"I call it the fog of war,\" he said. Farmworkers may not be adequately protected Although the average American is not at risk right from bird flu, farmworkers, especially those working around poultry and cattle, probably are. \"We've been so fixated on, 'Is this going to become a pandemic?' and not enough on 'There's a threat on our farms today,'\" Nuzzo said. \"We should not wait for a severe illness in order to protect farmworkers.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended dairy workers and people who come onto dairy farms use eye protection, wash their hands frequently and wear things like disposable coveralls if they travel from farm to farm, so as not to carry the virus with them, Jonker noted. In addition to the basic worries about worker health, the more workers become infected, the greater the risk one of them won't be able to clear the virus quickly. Viruses evolve as they pass from person to person but also within a single person, especially if they don't shake it off quickly, Bhadelia said. \"The more people it infects, and the longer it adapts to the human body,\" she said, the more likely the virus will become contagious �nd dangerous �o other people. Yes, vaccines and antivirals are available to the public, but... Unfortunately, even people who've gotten annual flu shots or caught the flu recently won't have any protection against the H5N1 strain, said Lawrence Gostin, a leader in global health at Georgetown University, where he is faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. The federal government has flu vaccine and antiviral stockpiles that theoretically could be useful if H5N1 becomes easily transmissible among people. But public health experts say the reality is much more complicated. There won't be enough for everyone and the vaccine that's been stockpiled hasn't been tested to prove it can effectively prevent infection or severe disease. \"I don't know that anyone has a vaccine that's been tested thoroughly that anyone would be really confident about its effectiveness,\" said Dr. Jeremy Luban, a professor at the UMass Chan Medical School and member of the executive committee of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness. \"Part of the problem is we don't actually know what that virus is until it appears.\" Two companies are testing a candidate vaccine in early trials, David Boucher, a top official within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, said at the news conference. If the virus moves from animals into people, it will continue to mutate, so existing vaccines might not be effective and it's challenging to develop and test a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist, Luban said. Such testing would take time and the flu virus, which mutates much faster than the virus that causes COVID-19, would continue to transform. Antivirals, like Tamiflu, are likely to be effective against bird flu, federal officials say. But they need to be taken within the first day or two after infection starts, at a time when most people aren't even sure whether they are sick and well before they have time to make a doctor's appointment and get and fulfill a prescription for an antiviral. But the food supply is almost certainly safe, officials say. Both public health and federal officials reassured the public about the safety of the commercial food supply. Concerns about bird flu passing through milk is another reason people should avoid drinking unpasteurized milk, Nuzzo said. 'There are a lot of reasons not to drink raw milk,' she said. 'We just added a new one.' The point of pasteurization is to kill pathogens. The Food and Drug Administration has tested 297 commercial samples that had evidence of the H5N1 virus, including 96 milk samples and another 200 products made with milk, like cottage cheese and sour cream. In all cases, the virus had been killed by pasteurization and posed no health risk, said Dr. Donald A. Prater, the FDA's acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The agency also tested infant and toddler formula and found no viral particles at all, Prater told reporters. Surveillance on poultry farms is more extensive than on cattle farms because bird flu has been seen in birds for much longer, Jonker and others said. At the first sign of infection on an egg or chicken farm, animals are 'culled,' a polite way of saying 'killed' and their eggs destroyed. The government long ago set aside funds to compensate farmers for having to take such drastic actions, he said. The meat supply is almost certainly safe, Emilio Esteban USDA's Under Secretary for Food Safety, told reporters. He said animals are inspected before slaughter and carcasses must pass inspection after slaughter. 'We are confident the meat supply is safe,' he said. For extra security, his department is now running tests on retail samples of ground beef purchased from states where dairy herds have been affected by bird flu, along with muscle from cows killed after being infected with bird flu and from beef patties cooked at three different temperatures to document that cooking kills any virus that might remain in the meat. 'We are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe,' he said. 'We are doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure we have additional data points.

{"id": "527", "title": "Texas dairy farm worker� case may be first where bird flu virus spread from mammal to human, scientists say", "date": "2024-05-03", "fulltext": "A new report on the first human bird flu case tied to the outbreak in cows in the United States suggests that the Texas man may be the first detected case of the H5N1 virus transmitting from a mammal to a person. Nearly 900 people in 23 countries have been infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus since it started spreading from Southeast Asia in late 2003. But previous human cases were all linked to transmission from infected birds, typically domestic poultry. The report, published Friday by the New England Journal of Medicine, details the unidentified man’s symptoms and his possible route of infection. It was written by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Texas Department of State Health Services, and the Texas Tech University Bioterrorism Response Laboratory in Lubbock. How the man became infected cannot be proven; while the cattle on the farm where he worked reportedly suffered from a decline in milk and other symptoms seen in herds that have tested positive for H5N1, no animal testing at that farm was undertaken. The authors noted, though, that nearby farms where dairy cows experienced the same symptoms tested positive for the virus. Related: Bird flu virus circulated in cows for four months before outbreak confirmed by USDA, analysis shows “Given the infected human was a dairy farm worker with reported exposure to sick, presumably infected cows in Texas and without reported exposure to other mammals or birds, we believe the genetic and epidemiologic data are strong evidence of infection of the human following exposure to presumably HPAI A(H5N1) virus-infected cows,” they wrote in the supplementary materials that accompanied their report. HPAI A(H5N1) is scientific shorthand for highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of the H5N1 subtype. The term “highly pathogenic” applies only to how the virus behaves when it infects poultry, though people might easily assume it applies more broadly, given how deadly this virus has proven to be over the decades. Roughly half of the people known to have been infected died. It kills wild birds and dozens of mammalian species, including cats (domestic and large cats), seals, foxes, mink, and many other scavenging carnivores that have had the misfortune of consuming infected wild birds. In the report the authors describe, the man’s illness was exceedingly mild. His lungs were clear and he had no trouble breathing; he had no fever. His sole symptom appeared to be conjunctivitis, a condition colloquially known as pink eye. The man and people he lived with were given flu antiviral drugs. He reported that his conjunctivitis cleared up. None of the people he lived with became sick. Ideally in cases like this, scientists would draw blood from the man and his contacts, as well as from other people working on the farm, to look for antibodies to the H5N1 virus. Presence of antibodies among other farm workers might suggest the virus is passing to people more commonly than has been seen. Antibodies in the blood of the man’s contacts could indicate that he transmitted the infection to them, but that their cases were so mild they didn’t have symptoms. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy But this work was not done, the report said, because the man and his contacts would not agree to have blood drawn. “We were also unable to collect acute or convalescent sera to assess seroconversion in the dairy farm worker or household contacts,” they said. Likewise it appears that health authorities were not allowed on the farm to investigate whether more workers might have been infected. The authors report that nasal swabs taken from the man also showed presence of virus, but at much lower levels than what was found in his conjunctiva, the tissue surrounding the eye. They hypothesize that the man could have been infected by one of two routes. Either virus in the air in the milking parlor landed in his eyes reportedly he did not wear eye protection or he may have had virus on his hands or gloves and transferred it to his eye inadvertently, they suggested. Analysis of the genetic sequence of the virus retrieved from this man has shown that while it is closely related to the viruses that have been causing the cow outbreaks, it does not fit neatly into the viral family tree that scientists studying the sequences have developed. The authors suggested that it’s possible the virus was from a slightly different offshoot that has died off; alternatively, there could have been more than one spillover event from birds in the Texas panhandle region where these outbreaks were first observed. Related: Tracking bird flu virus changes in cows is stymied by missing data, scientists say To date, 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus, though it is believed that many more have experienced outbreaks but have not been tested. Both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC have acknowledged that farmers have often refused to cooperate with their efforts to investigate these outbreaks. The report noted that the virus from the man was closely related, genetically, to the viruses used to produce two batches of H5N1 vaccine that the U.S. government has made and stockpiled as a hedge against a bird flu pandemic.

The farm worker reported eye discomfort and redness late last month after coming into contact with sick cattle. The livestock exhibited similar symptoms to cows in northern Texas that were diagnosed with the H5N1 virus, according to a medical report published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The patient was quickly diagnosed with the bird flu strain Type A H5N1, which is spreading rapidly among livestock. Doctors released the first image of a patient diagnosed with bird flu, who experienced hemorrhaging in the eyes. Timothy M. Uyeki et al/New England Journal of Medicine Doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which initially diagnosed the unidentified person, released a photo as part of the report on Friday. It outlined the symptoms and showed the patient's bloodshot eyes severely hemorrhaged. The right eye, which experienced the fluid drainage, was especially red. The worker wore gloves but no face mask or eye protection when he dealt with the animals, according to doctors. The virus appeared to infect only the farmhand's eyes and luckily didn't spread to his lungs. The patient had no changes in vision, fever or other any other symptoms and the fiery pinkeye cleared up within days, according to the report.

Casa.da.Photo � stock.adobe.com The mild case isn't guaranteed � while some people don't develop any noticeable symptoms, others can come down with severe, life-threatening pneumonia. Around 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization, and some experts fear the real threat would come if there are further mutations. The patient was told to isolate and was treated with an antiviral drug for the flu, according to the CDC. The agency said in a release on April 1 that the threat to the general public remains low despite the infection, but those with close or prolonged exposure to infected birds or other animals are at greater risk. Authorities also insist the nation's meat dairy supply is not at risk. The Texas worker became the second person in the US to contract the virus, according to federal and state officials. Officials say the recent bird flu infection does not mean there is any greater risk to the general public. It was originally detected in Antarctica in October 2023.

{"id": "532", "title": "WHO� top scientist learned a hard lesson about H5N1 two decades ago: Stopping it takes more than biology", "date": "2024-05-07", "fulltext": "Jeremy Farrar, now the World Health Organization� chief scientist, was working in Vietnam 20 years ago when the H5N1 virus started to spread across Asia �t that point in poultry. He recalls there was a reluctance among farmers to cull their chickens because they weren� being compensated for them. Movement of infected birds to evade culling only served to disseminate the virus, which in the years since has spread to all continents except Australia. It� important to keep that experience in mind, he told STAT Monday, as the H5N1 bird flu virus now spreads among dairy cattle in the U.S. Farrar stressed that the social context is key in responding to disease threats like H5N1, noting that a similar reluctance among dairy farmers to report outbreaks or allow testing of their workers is adding to the challenges in assessing how much transmission is occurring and the risk it poses to people. That fits with the description of how this virus is behaving in cows, with clear signs of infection in the udders, but little evidence of respiratory tract infections and no reports to date of cows experiencing neurological symptoms. This virus has been seen to attack the brains of a number of other mammalian species it can infect, including cats, which is why consideration of whether cows’ brains are also susceptible is important. The work was done by scientists at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark’s Statens Serum Institut, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. FURTHER READING Go deeper: H5N1 bird flu in cows The bird flu virus currently poses a low risk to humans, but it still keeps the CDC's top flu expert up at night. Pasteurization inactivates the H5N1 virus in milk. Scientists say raw milk should be especially avoided now that avian flu has been found in cows. Alarm, not harm: Dairy state lawmakers urge restrained approach and government assistance to farmers dealing with avian flu outbreak. Pandemic preparedness experts call for bird flu wastewater surveillance. The distribution of the receptor types some of which avian flu viruses can attach to, others to which human flu viruses attach raises concerns that cows could potentially give rise to a version of H5N1 or another novel flu virus that is able to transmit efficiently to and among people, the authors suggested. “These results provide a mechanistic rationale for the high levels of H5N1 virus reported in infected bovine milk and show cattle have the potential to act as a mixing vessel for novel [influenza virus] generation,” they wrote. Pigs, which can be infected with both bird flu and human flu viruses, have traditionally been referred to as mixing vessels for new viruses that could pose a pandemic threat. That’s because when an animal is co-infected with different flu viruses, the pathogens can swap genes, a process called reassortment. That phenomenon could give rise to new virus strains with enough human genes to be able to easily infect people, but also enough bird flu genes to be foreign enough to human immune systems that they could pose a serious risk to human health. Cows have not been thought to pose such a risk. Though it’s known they can be infected with flu viruses, influenza hasn’t been seen to be a major issue for cows. And until this outbreak, cows have not played a role in the H5N1 story. This virus, first seen in China in 1996, is primarily one that infects wild birds and domestic poultry, though it has been shown to be able to infect numerous mammalian species over the nearly three decades that have followed. In that time, nearly 900 human infections have been detected. Of those people, roughly half have died. In the current U.S. outbreak, one human case has been detected, a dairy farm worker in Texas whose sole symptom was conjunctivitis. It’s widely believed there may have been other cases, but farmers have in many cases been unwilling to cooperate with health authorities trying to investigate the outbreak and many of the workers have been wary of cooperating as well. Related: Texas dairy farm worker’s case may be first where bird flu virus spread from mammal to human, scientists say Some scientists not involved in the research described the paper as interesting, but questioned whether one could conclude cows pose a mixing vessel risk based on these findings. Malik Peiris, chair of virology in the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, told STAT in an email that previous research has shown that cows are not highly susceptible to human flu viruses. Furthermore, it would be hard to see how a human flu virus could reach a cow’s udder, which contains receptors for both avian and human flu viruses. “Thus, I do not think the risk of human flu-H5N1 reassortment in cows is likely.” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, Canada, agreed, noting that knowing which tissues a flu virus can attach to only tells part of the story. There are other factors, she said, that determine whether or not a virus can replicate in the cells it attaches to, triggering infection. That said, Rasmussen, who studies animal diseases that can jump into people, is still worried about H5N1 in cows. To date, H5N1 infections have been confirmed in 36 herds in nine states. “I’m more concerned about cow H5 evolving toward human-to-human transmission by jumping between different hosts (bird to cow to human, cow to bird to cat, cow to cat) as well as cow to cow. This selects for viruses that can infect, replicate efficiently, and shed enough to transmit onward in many different hosts, and increases the odds that it could do so in a human one,” she wrote in an email. “These data are confirmation to me that it is essential to get the cow outbreak under control, because there are many possibilities for a more transmissible human virus to emerge from it.” The Danish researchers took samples of stored tissues brain, respiratory tract, and mammary gland from a small number of cows and a calf. Some of the cows were dairy cows; others were beef cattle. They stained the tissue to see what receptors they had, whether they were for human or avian flu viruses, and among the latter whether they were the type best adapted for viruses that circulate among chickens or those that circulate in wild ducks. A spillover of virus from wild birds is believed to have started this outbreak in cows. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy They found few receptors in the brain tissue they examined. “What we found was that the influenza receptors were expressed in the neurons, but in a very low amount. So we also speculate that this could be the reason why there have not been found any neurological signs” among infected cattle, said first author Charlotte Kristensen. Kristensen is defending her thesis this week and is set to begin postdoctoral research at the university, in the department of veterinary and animal sciences. A surprising finding was a lack of receptors in the ducts of the mammary glands, which the authors said argues against the notion that cows are becoming infected by what they call an “ascending infection.” The leading hypothesis for how this infection is spreading among cows is that when an infected cow enters a herd, small amounts of its H5N1-contaminated milk can remain on milking equipment, coming in contact with the teats of uninfected cows, who then become infected. Peiris, while agreeing the receptor pattern in the mammary ducts was surprising, said he still believes this route of infection is most likely, noting that there are reports that some cows only experience infection in some not all quarters of their udders. “There is no other way to explain how one segment of the mammary gland is infected while others are unaffected,” Peiris said. Rasmussen agreed. “These results are interesting and good to know.

{"id": "534", "title": "If many dairy farm workers contract H5N1, we risk a pandemic", "date": "2024-05-07", "fulltext": "The discovery of bird flu virus particles in milk has moved the federal government to take more aggressive action to prevent the further spread of H5N1 on dairy farms. The Agriculture Department has rightly issued new testing recommendations meant to keep the virus from spreading across state lines. But this additional testing will do little to address the primary threat that H5N1 poses to humans: the infection of farmworkers. Our failure to protect them threatens their health and gives the virus an opportunity to evolve into a greater threat to people, including those who live far from dairy farms. The discovery of viral material in milk sold in American stores is not in itself alarming. Pasteurization, though it doesn't remove pathogens, destroys their ability to infect people. Follow-up testing has confirmed this: Researchers have not been able to isolate and grow the virus from pasteurized milk. But H5N1 poses risks to dairy workers, who may be exposed to infected cows and to milk before it is pasteurized. So far, only one dairy worker in the United States is known to have been infected, and fortunately this person experienced only mild eye inflammation. But there are reports that other dairy workers have gotten sick at the same time that cows have. Veterinarian Barb Peterson told Bovine Veterinarian, \"There's been underreporting of the virus. Understandably, there's been a lot of fear. But every dairy that I've worked with has �ith the exception of one �ad sick human beings at the same time they had sick cows.\" These reports are concerning, not because the infections are severe but because any rise in human infections boosts the chances that the virus will find its way to someone who has more medical conditions and may have a worse disease outcome if infected. And H5N1 has not historically been mild in humans. Of the almost 900 known cases of H5N1 infection in humans worldwide, the virus has killed about half. So it is crucial to protect from exposure farmworkers who are likely to be in contact with infected animals. The eye protection and masks recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should be readily available to all dairy workers. All states have access to this protective equipment, but making sure dairy farms and operations provide it to their workers and normalize its use will take education. Dairy workers also need H5N1 vaccines; efforts to make them available need to be expedited. And because many farmworkers are immigrants, work is needed to overcome both a widespread lack of health insurance and strong financial and legal disincentives to report infections. U.S. health officials have said that the virus now showing up on dairy farms is a good match for vaccines under development. But they have not been clear about the status of vaccines in the existing stockpile, or when the Food and Drug Administration might authorize them to be used. As we learned from covid-19, delays in vaccination could lead to unnecessary deaths. Protecting workers and preventing the next pandemic also require greater virus surveillance on farms and in dairy processing facilities. The USDA's updated requirements, which mandate the testing of lactating cows only when they are about to move to another state, won't protect farmworkers. The tests have to be sent to laboratories, and this delays results that would signal the need to protect people. More widespread testing on dairy farms remains voluntary and limited to animals with symptoms �espite evidence that cows experience asymptomatic infections and that other farm animals also have been infected. Wider testing of cows is challenging but essential, as is expanded testing of workers in the dairy industry. Everyone working on dairy farms needs immediate access to antiviral medications in case an outbreak occurs. Rapid tests need to be quickly developed so that samples can be analyzed on farms rather than sent away to labs. And it is crucial to regularly sequence virus samples isolated from cows in order to monitor any genetic mutations that could improve the virus's ability to infect humans or to evade antiviral medicines. The USDA has so far been slow to share genetic information on virus samples gathered from infected cows, and this must change immediately. Preventing farmworker infections and uncontrolled spread in mammals is key to stopping the virus from spreading more easily among humans. This requires active coordination among federal, state, and local agricultural and public health officials. Jennifer B.

{"id": "541", "title": "Bird flu keeps rewriting the textbooks. It� why scientists are unsettled by the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak", "date": "2024-05-09", "fulltext": "Twenty-seven years ago today, a 3-year-old boy in Hong Kong developed a sore throat, spiked a fever, and started to cough. Six days later, he was hospitalized; six days after that, he died of acute respiratory distress caused by viral pneumonia. Testing showed the toddler, who� had contact with sick chickens before becoming ill, had been infected with H5N1 bird flu. His death was the first attributed to a bird flu virus, and since then, dozens more young children across a number of countries have died from this virus, H5N1. In fact, in the weeks that followed the boy� death, 17 other children in Hong Kong contracted the virus and five more died. It was a tragedy �nd a profound shock for the scientists who studied influenza. Until 1997, it was thought avian flu viruses didn’t infect people very often, and when they did, at most they caused exceedingly mild disease. That was what was seen when scientists experimentally infected human volunteers with three different bird flu viruses not H5N1 about 35 years ago. The Hong Kong outbreak was the first time the H5N1 virus pulled off the unexpected, rewriting the textbooks that sometimes over-confidently stated what the myriad versions of influenza A viruses found in wild birds and other species could and could not do. But it wouldn’t be the last time. In the nearly three decades since, flu scientists have tracked this virus with both vigilance and dread, watching it defy dogma again and again, learning through hard experience that it is a foe not to be underestimated. Related: Large amount of bird flu virus in milk suggests asymptomatic cows are infected with H5N1 Most scientists that STAT has spoken to since the H5N1 outbreak in cattle in the United States was confirmed are unsettled by the notion that the virus is spreading in mammals with which humans have close contact. “That’s a different ball game altogether,” said Malik Peiris, chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health. “That hadn’t happened in Asia all this time.” Nancy Cox, who for years headed the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said this particular lineage of H5N1, a descendent of a virus first spotted in a goose in China’s Guangdong province in 1996, is unlike any other family of flu viruses she recalls. “It seems that these viruses must have some kind of ‘special sauce’ that has allowed them to find ways to persistently spread, evolve, and cause what appear to be increasingly serious problems in both wildlife and domesticated animals,” Cox, who is now retired, told STAT in an email. “There is an element of unexpected robustness and malleability that has surprised even seasoned influenza watchers.” One such observer is Peiris, who has been closely tracking H5N1 since its first known foray into people. A few years later, in December 2002, he was planning to travel home to Sri Lanka for Christmas, as he did every year. Then wild water birds ducks, egrets, herons, and the like started dying in two waterfowl reserves in the city. The cause: H5N1. That too was startling. Wild birds had only been seen to be seriously sickened by bird flu viruses once before, in 1961. And ducks, the natural hosts of bird flu viruses, were thought to be more or less impervious to disease caused by them, said Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Flu viruses don’t attack the respiratory tracts of ducks and other wild water birds, as they do in people. In these birds, the viruses infect cells in the gut, passing through them before being excreted in their droppings. The birds don’t get visibly ill, the textbooks said. Until they did. “All these species, they were falling over dead,” Peiris said in a recent interview. “I missed Christmas. … I stayed in Hong Kong and was swabbing birds.” Related: As livestock move around the country, so does H5N1. The U.S. needs real-time tracking of livestock movements Necropsies the name for an animal autopsy showed a surprising pattern of disseminated disease atypical of previous observations of bird flu, and dramatically different from what is seen in human flu infection. This unusual finding of H5N1’s ability to spread outside the lungs, to organs like the liver and the brain, has been seen again and again over the intervening years in laboratory studies of Kuiken conducted in cats and necropsies of foxes, skunks, mink, and other mammals found to have died of H5N1 infection. It was also reported in a human case, a boy from Vietnam who died in 2004. In the spring of 2005, the phenomenon Peiris helped to record in the parks of Hong Kong happened on a much larger scale in a migratory bird reserve in Western China known as Qinghai Lake. Between April and June of that year, there was a large-scale die-off of wild birds there, again traced to H5N1. A little avian flu background is helpful here. Two groups of bird flu viruses those bearing H5 or H7 hemagglutinin proteins on their exteriors can transition from being of low pathogenicity to being highly pathogenic when the viruses spread in domestic poultry. (The term highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI, refers to how the virus behaves in poultry.) Seeing highly pathogenic, or high-path, viruses move back into wild birds in a big way raised serious concerns that wild birds could transmit the virus further and faster than was already occurring via the movement of infected poultry across Southeast Asia. “We published on it and we warned because this is a migrating center that this could be spreading far and wide,” Peiris said. Some scientists took a more sanguine view, spouting an aphorism that was heard often in 2005: Dead birds don’t fly. Apparently infected birds do, however. “Really, within a year it was in India and Egypt and Africa and Central Asia,” Peiris said. In the nearly two decades since the Qinghai Lake incident, H5N1 viruses have made their way around the globe, even to perhaps the most unlikely spot of all, Antarctica, infecting penguins and other wild birds there. Only Australia and New Zealand have yet to find H5N1 at this point. Another area in which H5 has rewritten the textbooks relates to what Cox referred to, the virus’ astonishing persistence. The former CDC flu director went back through influenza literature back to reports of “fowl plague,” as avian flu outbreaks in poultry used to be called in the 1800s and early 1900s, before influenza viruses were first identified to see how long outbreaks lasted. Related: WHO’s top scientist learned a hard lesson about H5N1 two decades ago: Stopping it takes more than biology Once high-path viruses emerged in poultry, the outbreaks they triggered tended to burn themselves out within a few years, especially when infected birds were culled to try to stop spread. But since reemerging in Hong Kong in late 2002, H5N1 has never really gone away. At some points it has been more headline grabbing than others with the recent discovery that it can infect cows, for instance. (“Who would have thought cows would get infected? And in this way?” Peiris exclaimed.) But it has never disappeared. “I’m not aware of another … avian flu virus that’s been circulating at this global scale for this long,” said Jeremy Farrar, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist. “That’s unprecedented.” Cox agreed. “While it wasn’t exactly scientific dogma that [high-path] avian viruses would eventually burn themselves out or fade away, it was clear from the history of past outbreaks that this is what happened for the majority of our well-documented outbreaks,” she said. Initially H5N1 was a problem in Southeast and then South Asia, later moving into the Nile River Delta of Egypt and Turkey, then into Europe. But for more than a decade, this highly problematic virus was not found in the Americas, which seemed to support another piece of flu dogma: Flu viruses found in birds that traveled in the migratory flyways that spanned Eurasia did not make their way to the flyways of the Americas. The oft-repeated claim was that the routes flown by migratory birds would keep H5 from crossing to the New World. “Pretty sure I might have said something similar,” admitted Richard Webby, director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals, at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Related: CDC’s top flu scientist says the risk to the public from H5N1 is low, but she isn’t sleeping well. Here’s why And then, that “never the twain shall meet” situation turned out to be wishful thinking. In late 2014 and early 2015, H5N2 and H5N8 viruses equally dangerous half siblings of H5N1 from Asia, bearing the same H5 hemagglutinin were found in poultry operations in multiple U.S. states. And then in late 2021, H5N1 itself was found in poultry and wild birds in Newfoundland, Canada’s easternmost province. So much for the non-intersection of the flyways. “By and large, that’s true the gene pools in migratory birds are distinct,” Peiris said. “But looking back, there were some clues of the mixture of viruses at the individual gene level, that reassortment was occasionally taking place.” (Reassortment is a process by which different flu viruses swap genes within a host, creating hybrids, like H5N2 or H5N8.) From eastern Canada, H5N1 has worked its way through the Americas, infecting two men in the United States, a young girl in Ecuador and a man in Chile in the past couple of years. It has also ignited large poultry outbreaks, and infected and killed an astonishing array of mammals seals and sea lions, various types of bears, coyotes, bobcats, mountain lions, raccoons, and otters among them. Some of these species have previously been seen to be susceptible to influenza, such as seals. But the scale of the toll the virus is taking on wildlife is unlike anything previously attributed to an influenza virus. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy It’s believed H5N1 may be spreading mammal to mammal in some of the marine species, though this is hard to prove, Kuiken said. It’s clear that it is moving cow-to-cow in the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak likely with human help. The dairy cow outbreak has uncovered a fact that had been seen before but not widely noted mammary glands are susceptible to flu viruses. The previous such observation occurred in relation to the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, when some infected women complained of mastitis. Canadian scientists infected ferret pups with H1N1 and allowed them to nurse; their mothers developed infection in their mammary glands. It is not knowable whether H5N1 will ever acquire the capacity to easily infect people and spread person-to-person in other words, trigger a pandemic. But ongoing transmission in a mammalian species gives the virus a chance to adapt to hosts that are far closer, genetically, to humans than are ducks or chickens. No one who has watched this virus thinks letting H5 get seeded into cow populations is a good idea. Adding to the complexity of this situation is that unlike its behavior in other species it infects, H5N1 isn’t making cows seriously ill. It makes the virus harder to track, and gives farmers less impetus to cooperate with authorities trying to determine how far the virus has spread. “The latest curveball with [high-path] H5 infection in dairy cattle is very concerning because there is little incentive to test dairy cows or their human contacts,” Cox said. “One can see so many potential problems on dairy farms. There are the asymptomatic infections in cows and perhaps people. There are the cows, the dogs, and the cats, and the other farm animals including perhaps pigs, the farm workers, and the family members and so on. It is going to be very challenging to get a clear picture of what is actually happening in anything like real time.” In the nearly three decades of human interaction with H5N1, the virus has taught us a lot about influenza viruses, consigning many things that were previously considered flu facts to the scientific trash bin. Kuiken said in the early 2000s he would give talks about H5N1 with the title “Breaking Rules.” He eventually stopped, he said, “because this lineage broke so many.” All those information resets should have taught us an important and overarching lesson, flu experts say. We should never assume we know everything this virus can do. “We absolutely should be hoping for the best, but planning for the possibility that this is going to be able to transmit human to human, and has the potential of becoming a pandemic virus,” said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Arizona who has been working with an international team of scientists to try to figure out when the cow outbreak started. “It’s much too early to sit back and say, ‘Well, it hasn’t happened yet, so it’s not going to happen.’”", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article mentions that dozens of young children across a number of countries have died from the H5N1 virus, and in a specific outbreak in Hong Kong, 17 children contracted the virus and five died.

In a sign of the pressure already on China, Australia and Vietnam joined the U.S. and others in distancing their citizens from the country over the coronavirus, while Apple Inc. shut its stores on the Chinese mainland and Beijing pledged more support for embattled businesses. The Latest on the Coronavirus * Australia orders its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days * Vietnam halts all flights to and from Taiwan and China * Apple closes all of its retail stores in mainland China until Feb. 9 * Beijing pledges more support for its economy * Avian influenza adds to concerns about economy The avian influenza is likely to add to the economic damage rather than pose a major immediate health risk. China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that a case of H5N1 avian influenza, last identified in China in April last year, had killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. But while avian influenza can be fatal in humans, with a mortality rate of 60%, according to the World Health Organization, it doesn't spread easily to humans. In addition to the coronavirus, China has been grappling with an outbreak of African swine fever that has decimated the country's pig population over the past two years. Pork is China's main source of protein, and swine fever last year pushed overall consumer inflation to the highest level in eight years. Hunan province, where the avian influenza outbreak announced on Saturday took place, neighbors Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Australia said that it would impose new entry restrictions in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, banning foreign nationals who have been in mainland China in the past 14 days from entering Australia, while Qantas Airways Ltd., the country's national carrier, said it would suspend flights to the mainland starting Feb. 9. Vietnam's civil aviation authority said it would halt all flights to and from Taiwan and China, including the special Chinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong, starting Saturday. Several countries and airlines have suspended flights to China, including Pakistan, Italy and the U.S.'s American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. The move by Australia, which also ordered its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days, to tighten entry restrictions followed a U.S. tightening. A day earlier, the U.S. said it would deny entry to foreign nationals who had traveled anywhere in China within the past 14 days and imposed quarantines on Americans returning from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. The coronavirus has killed 259 people and infected nearly 12,000 in China as of late Friday, according to the official National Health Commission in Beijing. The number of infected patients in China alone now exceeds the global total for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed nearly 800 people after emerging from southern China in 2002 and 2003. Authorities in Beijing pledged more support for the economy in a bid to reassure investors before markets reopen on Monday. Companies and industries in regions hit particularly hard by the outbreak, including those that provide medical supplies, could get reduced lending rates, the central bank said in a joint statement with other government agencies, including the Finance Ministry and the banking regulator. China's cabinet said separately that products imported from the U.S. to control the outbreak will be exempt from punitive tariffs through March 31. Authorities also exempted tariffs and other taxes on products donated by overseas entities, according to a joint statement by the Finance Ministry and the customs agency. Resources are strained in Hubei province, and medical staff have been forced to turn away patients because of a lack of beds and basic medical supplies. Local authorities in Huanggang, a city about 35 miles east of Wuhan, imposed new restrictions on residents' movements, saying only one person per household in the city center would be allowed to go out every two days to purchase basic necessities. Apple is closing all of its retail stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb. 9 \"out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts,\" it said. The company operates more than 40 stores in China. North Korea said through its state media that it would send an aid fund to Chinese authorities, a rare extension of aid from Pyongyang. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, \"expressed deep consolation for the families who lost their blood relatives due to the infectious disease,\" according to a report in Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency. North Korea� close ally of China that has long been dependent on China's largess�as among the first countries to adopt stringent measures to keep the coronavirus outside its borders, and vowed to redouble its efforts. \"The novel coronavirus throws the world into uneasiness and horror, but the advantages and might of our state system�ill be fully demonstrated to the whole world once again, when we ensure that the virus does not reach our country and that no one suffers from the infections,\" it read.

{"id": "7", "title": "Avian Flu Fast Facts", "date": "2024-06-05", "fulltext": "(CNN) � Here's a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds. There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called \"Influenza A (H5N1),\" or the \"H5N1 virus.\" Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu. The mortality rate is close to 60% for infected humans. Timeline Early 1900s -The avian flu is first identified in Italy. 1961 - The H5N1 strain is isolated in birds in South Africa. December 1983 - Chickens in Pennsylvania and Virginia are exposed to the avian flu and more than five million birds are killed to stop the disease from spreading. 1997 - Eighteen people are infected by the H5N1 strain in Hong Kong, six die. These are the first documented cases of human infection. Hong Kong destroys its entire poultry population, 1.5 million birds. 1999 - Two children in Hong Kong are infected by the H9N2 strain. February 2003 - Eighty-four people in the Netherlands are affected by the H7N7 strain of the virus, one dies. February 7, 2004 - Twelve thousand chickens are killed in Kent County, Delaware, after they are found to be infected with the H7 virus. October 7, 2005 - The avian flu reaches Europe. Romanian officials quarantine a village of about 30 people after three dead ducks there test positive for bird flu. November 12, 2005 - A one-year-old boy in Thailand tests positive for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. November 16, 2005 - The World Health Organization confirms two human cases of bird flu in China, including a female poultry worker who died from the H5N1 strain. November 17, 2005 - Two deaths are confirmed in Indonesia from the H5N1 strain of avian influenza.

December 20, 2011 - The US Department of Health and Human Services releases a statement saying that the government is urging scientific journals to omit details from research they intend to publish on the transfer of H5N1 among mammals. There is concern that the information could be misused by terrorists. July 31, 2012 - Scientists announce that H3N8, a new strain of avian flu, caused the death of more than 160 baby seals in New England in 2011. March 31, 2013 - Chinese authorities report the first human cases of infection of avian flu H7N9 to the World Health Organization. H7N9 has not previously been detected in humans. December 6, 2013 - A 73-year-old woman infected with H10N8 dies in China, the first human fatality from this strain. January 8, 2014 - Canadian health officials confirm that a resident from Alberta has died from H5N1 avian flu, the first case of the virus in North America. It is also the first case of H5N1 infection ever imported by a traveler into a country where the virus is not present in poultry. April 20, 2015 - Officials say more than five million hens will be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility in northwest Iowa. According to the US Department of Agriculture, close to eight million cases of bird flu have been detected in 13 states since December. Health officials say there is little to no risk for transmission to humans with respect to H5N2. No human infections with the virus have ever been detected. January 15, 2016 - The US Department of Agriculture confirms that a commercial turkey farm in Dubois County, Indiana, has tested positive for the H7N8 strain of avian influenza. January 24, 2017 - Britain's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs releases a statement confirming that a case of H5N8 avian flu has been detected in a flock of farmed breeding pheasants in Preston, UK. The flock is estimated to contain around 10,000 birds. The statement adds that a number of those birds have died, and the remaining live birds at the premises are being \"humanely\" killed because of the disease. February 12, 2017 - A number of provinces in China have shut down their live poultry markets to prevent the spread of avian flu after a surge in the number of infections from the H7N9 strain. At least six provinces have reported human cases of H7N9 influenza this year, according to Chinese state media, Xinhua. March 5-7, 2017 - The USDA confirms that a commercial chicken farm in Tennessee has tested positive for the H7N9 strain of avian flu, but says it is genetically different from the H7N9 lineage out of China.

Nagy Awad, head of the veterinary agency in the southwestern province of al-Wadi al-Gedid, said Sunday that avian influenza was detected in two poultry farms in the villages of Ezab el-Qasr and Oweina in the Dakhla Oasis, located over 750 kilometers (470 miles) from the capital, Cairo. He said the infected birds were culled and authorities have carried out medical examinations of people who were in contact with them. The virus, which is mainly spread through contact with infected animals, can cause severe illness or death in humans. Egypt suffered a major outbreak of bird flu in 2006 that led to the suspension of all poultry exports. Authorities have been pressing to renew them, and earlier this year, the World Organization for Animal Health, an intergovernmental body, had declared Egypt free of bird flu for the first time in 14 years. The H5N1 strain of bird flu spread in early 2000s in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, leading to the slaughter of tens of millions of chickens and ducks. Hundreds of people were infected, many of whom died, according to the World Health Organization. Egypt is at high risk because many of its poultry farms are in residential areas. Many Egyptians also raise pigeons and chickens at home to supplement their income. Even in dense urban areas, birds are kept on rooftops, balconies and courtyards.

{"id": "20", "title": "A New Bird Flu Jumps to Humans. So Far, It� Not a Problem.", "date": "2021-04-21", "fulltext": "Covid fuels the current virus pandemic, but the world is full of flu viruses waiting in the wings. And they keep changing unpredictably. When a bird flu virus struck a major poultry farm in Russia earlier this year, it was a reminder that the coronavirus causing the pandemic was not the only dangerous virus out there. The authorities quickly tested the birds and moved into high gear, killing 800,000 chickens, disposing of the carcasses and cleaning the farm to stop the potential spread to other chicken farms. But they were also concerned for humans. They tested the birds and sequenced the virus, determining that it was the H5N8 strain of avian flu, highly dangerous to both wild and domestic birds. It is established in Asia and has been increasingly causing deadly outbreaks in birds in Europe. H5N8 viruses have infected some poultry flocks in the United States, but the viruses come from a different though related lineage of virus, distinct from the current H5N8 viruses in Asia and Europe. Flu viruses combine and mutate frequently in unpredictable ways. In the short period from Dec. 25, 2020, to Jan. 14 of this year, more than seven million birds were lost to H5N8 outbreaks in Europe and Asia. Europe alone had 135 outbreaks among poultry and 35 among wild birds. Of course, to put the numbers in context, humans consume about 65 billion chickens each year, and one estimate puts the number of chickens on the globe at any one time at 23 billion. As damaging as H5N8 has been to birds, it had never infected people. Until February. The Russian health authorities also tested about 200 of the people involved in the cleanup of the farm in Astrakhan, using nasal swabs and later blood tests for antibodies. They reported that for the first time, H5N8 had jumped to people. Seven of the workers appeared to have been infected with the virus, although none of them became ill. Only one of those seven cases, however, was confirmed by genetically sequencing the virus. Nonetheless, the potential danger of the new virus and its jump to humans set off alarm bells for Dr. Daniel R. Lucey, a physician and a specialist in pandemics at Georgetown University. He began writing about the Astrakhan event in a blog for other infectious disease experts as soon as it was publicized. He reported that during a television interview, a Russian public health official said the H5N8 virus was likely to evolve into human-to-human transmission. That possibility was frightening. �The W.H.O. finally put out a report Feb. 26,�e said. But it did not frame the event as particularly alarming because the virus was not causing human disease, and the report judged the risk of human-to-human transmission as low, despite the Russian official� comment. To Dr. Lucey, no one else seemed to be taking the infection of humans with H5N8 as �f any concern.�e added, � think it� of concern.� Other scientists said they were not as worried. Dr. Florian Krammer, a flu researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, said he was more concerned about other avian flu viruses like H5N1 that have already shown themselves to be dangerous to people. Another avian influenza virus, H7N9, infected people for the first time in 2013. There have been more than 1,500 confirmed cases and more than 600 deaths since then. Since 2017 there have been only three confirmed cases and the virus does not jump easily from person to person. It is always possible that any virus can evolve human-to-human transmission, as well as become more dangerous. But H5N8 would have both hurdles to jump. Compared to other viral threats, Dr. Krammer said, �� not worried.� Dr. Richard J. Webby, a flu specialist at the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and director of the W.H.O.� Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that all of the H5 viruses are of concern because some of them have infected and killed people. But, he said, �hey all have the same sort of binding capacity to human cells, which is limited,�e said. Flu viruses use a slightly different way to attach to cells in birds than to cells in humans and being good at one usually means not being good at the other. Dr. Webby also said that while seven infections would certainly be of concern, only one infection has been confirmed. The tests of the other six involved nasal swabs and blood antibody tests. In people with no symptoms, he said, nasal swabs can simply indicate that they had breathed in virus. That would not mean it had infected them. Blood antibody tests also have a potential for error, he said, and may not be able to distinguish exposure to one flu virus from another. Nor did he see any scientific basis for suggesting that H5N8 is more likely than any other bird flu to evolve human-to-human transmission. But any virus could evolve that ability. Dr. Lucey said that he was heartened to see that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had prepared a candidate vaccine for H5N8 before it had infected humans. Candidate vaccines are simply first steps in planning for potential problems, and have not been through any testing. They exist for many viruses. �umans should be routinely tested for the virus, right at the time of the outbreak in birds,�r. Lucey said. He favors the protocol followed in Astrakhan, and argues that for any outbreak among birds, public health authorities should test people who are exposed to sick birds with nasopharyngeal swabs and an antibody test, followed by other antibody tests a few weeks later. An upcoming editorial in the journal Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease also takes up the Astrakhan incident and calls for increased monitoring of all H5 viruses.

China Reports First Human Case of H10N3 Strain", "date": "2021-06-04", "fulltext": "Chinese health authorities said a 41-year-old man had contracted a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3 and had been in the hospital since late April, calling it the first reported human case globally from the strain. The National Health Commission said the man developed a fever and other symptoms on April 23 and was admitted to hospital in Jiangsu province five days later. On Tuesday the health commission said his condition was stable and indicated he was ready to be discharged. How did the man become infected? The health commission didn't give details on how the man came into contact with the virus. Cases of bird flu in humans have most commonly been reported among those in close daily contact with poultry, such as chicken farmers. The commission advised the public to avoid contact with sick and dead poultry. Can bird flu kill people? Avian influenza can be fatal in humans. Highly pathogenic strains, such as H5N1, can have a mortality rate of about 60%, according to the World Health Organization. However, the WHO says, bird flu doesn't spread easily from birds to people. How common are bird-flu outbreaks in China? China has seen several outbreaks of bird flu, including one at the height of the coronavirus outbreak last year, when H5N1 avian influenza killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. In May, China's Agriculture Ministry said the H5N8 strain of bird flu killed hundreds of wild birds in Tibet, prompting authorities to disinfect areas including a national wetland park. Are authorities worried? China said the risk of a large-scale outbreak was extremely low. It said local health authorities' contact-tracing and monitoring efforts had found no other cases and no human-to-human transmission. It said the H10N3 strain doesn't have the ability to effectively infect humans. What do experts say? Human infections with bird-flu viruses are rare but not uncommon, said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, a professor at the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \"It is highly likely that this infection just represents one of the rare incidents of human infection with an avian influenza virus, without any more consequences,\" said Prof. Garcia-Sastre. \"Nevertheless, it's important to make sure that this is just that, a rare isolated incident.\" The fact that the case happened in April and there hasn't been any other reports of cases suggests there hasn't been a cluster of infections, says Peng Shifang, a professor of infectious diseases at Central South University in China's Hunan province. Is China upfront about the recent bird-flu case? China said it had determined on May 28 through genome sequencing that the man suffered from the H10N3 strain. It issued its statement on the results on Tuesday. While China has been criticized for a lack of transparency in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, its public-health apparatus is generally seen as having become more transparent since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, when official secrecy hampered the response.

A man has been hospitalized in southwestern China after contracting the H5N6 strain of avian flu, Chinese state news media reported on Thursday, a reminder that the world is full of flu viruses even during a coronavirus pandemic. The man, 55, was hospitalized in Bazhong, a city in the southwestern province of Sichuan, after coming down with a fever and testing positive for the virus on July 6, the state-run China Global Television Network reported. Local officials had �ctivated an emergency response and sterilized the area,�he broadcaster said in a brief report in English.

{"id": "33", "title": "What is bird flu and why is it back in the news?", "date": "2021-12-09", "fulltext": "With the UK hit by a record outbreak, here� a quick guide to the viral disease also known as avian influenza What is avian flu? Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a contagious viral disease in animals, caused by a virus loosely related to human influenza. Some strains of the disease have been passed to humans but this is very rare, and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals. While all bird species and, less commonly, pigs are thought to be susceptible, domestic poultry flocks are especially vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks can rapidly result in epidemics among bird populations. Public health authorities are concerned about the potential of the virus to mutate into subtypes capable of causing human disease. As a result they warn there is always a threat of a new influenza pandemic emerging. Why is it in the news again? The UK has been hit by a record outbreak that has resulted in 500,000 captive birds being culled this autumn. An avian influenza prevention zone was declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. What are the most dangerous strains? The NHS says there are four strains that have caused particular concern in recent years. The first, identified in 1997, was H5N1, followed by H7N9 in 2013, H5N6 the following year and H5N8 in 2016. The H5N1 form has been the cause of most concern in recent years and the UK government has said particular safety measures were put in place in parts of North Yorkshire on 21 November after confirmed and suspected cases of that strain in poultry in the area. Where has it appeared? The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, has said there are 40 infected premises in the UK. They include 38 in Great Britain �f which 33 are in England �nd two in Northern Ireland. By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland� Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on the Trotternish peninsula, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Some 22,100 ducks were culled at a commercial premises in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, while culling and an exclusion zone was also being applied to a second site in Broughshane, Co Antrim, described as a �mall backyard flock� If it just affects birds, why the panic? It doesn�. World Health Organization (WHO) figures show that from 2003 to 2021 there were 863 confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus in humans. Of these cases, 456 people died. While transmission is rare, it has happened. So far, most of the human deaths have been in countries in Asia, in communities in which people live in close proximity to poultry. Although it does not easily infect humans, every time it does it increases the chance that the virus could mutate into a form that could be passed from one infected human to another. The WHO fears this could lead to a flu pandemic. How do you catch bird flu? It is very unlikely you will catch the virus unless you have been in close contact with infected birds or someone with confirmed or suspected bird flu. The virus is found in secretions from the eyes and respiratory tract, and droppings of infected birds. Humans can catch the virus by inhaling droplets sneezed by infected birds or the dust from their bedding or droppings. What are the symptoms in humans? They vary depending on the strain. Most infections have flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and aches and pains. Symptoms of the H5N1 subtype are more severe and frequently result in death. Other symptoms can include conjunctivitis �ed, sore and discharging eyes. How does it spread? WHO scientists have said they believe it is likely the virus is carried by migrating birds. More recently the UK government has said it �preads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces� Officials added: �t can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear �vian influenza isn� an airborne virus.� It can spread to humans who touch infected birds, droppings or bedding or who kill or prepare infected poultry for cooking, the NHS has said. People cannot catch bird flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas affected by an outbreak, health officials have said. What measures is the UK taking? The government has said the chief veterinary officers for each of the UK� constituent nations have �greed to bring in new housing measures to protect poultry and captive birds from avian influenza following a number of confirmed cases across Great Britain in recent weeks� It added: �he new housing measures, which will come into force on Monday 29 November, mean that it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.� How do you spot the virus in birds? Symptoms in infected birds include a swollen head and blue discoloration around the neck and throat. They will also show signs of breathing problems including gaping beaks, coughing, sneezing and rattling wheezing. Poultry farmers will also notice a loss of appetite in the infected birds and a decrease in egg laying. People are advised not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds they find. In Great Britain, dead wild waterfowl or other wild birds should be reported to Defra. Some will then be collected and tested to help scientists understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird. What drug treatments are available to humans? There is no vaccine for avian flu. If a person were infected, the NHS has said they would be either told to stay at home or put into isolation in hospital. They would then be treated with an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (known as Tamiflu) or zanamivir (known as Relenza). Scientists have found that such treatments �elp reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival.

{"id": "37", "title": "Bird flu outbreak in Israel kills more than 5,200 cranes, with mass culling of poultry underway", "date": "2021-12-28", "fulltext": "Israel is battling the coronavirus and a surge in flu cases. But it's an outbreak of the H5N1 avian flu among migratory cranes and domestic poultry that is drawing global concern. The bird flu, as its also called, is spreading fast in northern Israel, where at least 5,200 cranes have died of the disease and hundreds of thousands of chickens have been culled in an effort to contain its advance. The avian flu is confined mostly to birds. It rarely jumps to humans, but when it does it can be lethal. As of October, the World Health Organization had confirmed 863 cases of H5N1 in people, 456 of whom died, around the world since 2003. Israel has not recorded any infections in humans this year. Those who have possibly been exposed to the virus are receiving preventive antiviral treatments. Other countries, including Britain, China, Norway and South Korea, have also reported major or higher-than-unusual H5N1 outbreaks in recent months. In November, Britain declared a bird flu prevention zone, requiring all farmers to follow stricter biosecurity protocols after several outbreaks. Israel is a central stop along the route of many species of birds migrating from Europe and Asia to Africa, a convergence that raises the risk of avian flu spreading from wild birds to captive poultry populations in the country. Each year, about 500,000 cranes migrate through Israel, some 30,000 of which stayed to winter over there this year. The yearly stopover, often part of journeys lasting thousands of miles, draws the attention of bird enthusiasts, who travel to observe the large, long-legged and long-necked birds. The H5N1 outbreak has wrought \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country,\" Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg said in a tweet Sunday. She shared a photo of dead cranes peppering a lake in Israel's Hula Nature Reserve, a hot spot for migratory birds. \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" Zandberg said. Israel reported its first cases of bird flu in 2006, and has seen outbreaks nearly every year since, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The extent of this year's train of transmission is not yet clear, but regulations require poultry and wild birds be kept separated to limit the chance of transference. Word of Israel's latest outbreak began to spread on Dec. 19, when the Agriculture Ministry reported that H5N1 had been detected in a farming community, Margaliot, near Israel's northern border with Lebanon. The ministry said it had closed off the area and halted egg production. Crowded and unregulated chicken coops are a \"ticking bomb\" for developing diseases, Agriculture Minister Oded Feror said in a statement at the time. That same day, Israeli media reported that about 100 cranes had died in a bird flu outbreak in Hula Lake in a nature reserve in northern Israel. Authorities closed down the area to the public and days later temporarily shut the entire nature reserve. Israel's Nature and Parks Authority shared photos of workers in hazmat suits collecting the bodies of dead cranes from the water. In the following days, outbreaks were detected in at least three other farms in the north as the Agriculture Ministry underwent mass testing. The parks authority said Thursday that an estimated 1 in 5 cranes in Israel were likely to be infected with the virus, Israeli media reported. There have also been reports of deaths from the virus among other bird species. Israel's Agricultural Ministry has warned the public to buy only eggs with the required regulatory stamp and to consume thoroughly cooked eggs to prevent any further spread. The public has also been warned to keep a distance from wild birds. On Tuesday, the ministry told chicken farmers in Margaliot to monitor cats that spend time around the coops, as felines can also become infected with the virus. Israeli media outlets reported that the mass culling of chickens has created a shortage of between 15 million and 20 million eggs a month. About 200 million eggs are consumed monthly in Israel.", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, with 456 deaths out of 863 cases since 2003, but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.", "spread_risk": "yes", "spread_feedback": "AFFIRMS RISK: 2, 4, 5 + \"The avian flu is confined mostly to birds.

{"id": "62", "title": "Avian Flu Spread in the U.S. Worries Poultry Industry", "date": "2022-02-24", "fulltext": "Though the risk to humans is low, scientists warn that outbreaks among farmed birds increase the potential for the virus to mutate and pose a threat to humans. A highly contagious and deadly form of avian influenza has been barreling across the eastern half of the United States in recent weeks, killing both wild birds and farmed poultry and raising fears that an unchecked outbreak could prove calamitous for an industry that was devastated by a similar virus seven years ago. Since early January, when it began killing chickens in northeast Canada, the virus has been identified in migratory waterfowl from Florida to Maine, and has infected backyard chickens in Virginia and New York and sickened thousands of turkeys in Kentucky and Indiana, prompting mass cullings and import bans. On Wednesday, federal officials announced that the virus, a so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza, had been found in a Delaware commercial chicken farm on the Delmarva Peninsula, home to one of the country� largest concentrations of poultry farms. Experts suspect wild birds returning from winter feeding grounds are spreading the virus, most likely through contaminated droppings. With the peak springtime migration still weeks away, many fear the worst is yet to come. �t� very concerning given how quickly this thing is accelerating,�aid Henry Niman, a biochemist in Pittsburgh who studies the genetic evolution of viruses and has been tracking the outbreak� spread across the country. � think we could see historic levels of infections.� Federal officials have been urging poultry growers to report sick or dying birds and to tighten their farms�iosecurity measures, which includes preventing contact between wild birds and domestic animals. �t� important to note that avian influenza is not considered to be a risk to public health and it� not a food-safety risk,�ike Stepien, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture� Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in an email. Although the danger to humans is low, scientists are keeping a close eye on the virus, the Eurasian H5N1, which is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry. That virus does not spread efficiently among humans, but it is extremely deadly, with a fatality rate of 60 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The strain currently spreading across the United States has not jumped to humans, but virologists and epidemiologists say the mounting infections among birds is worrisome because it increases the possibility that the virus could mutate in ways that make it more infectious to people. Dr. Gail Hansen, a public health veterinarian who is the former state epidemiologist for Kansas, noted that influenza viruses have historically been behind the pandemics that affect humans. Some medical historians have traced the deadly influenza pandemic of 1918 to Army recruits in Kansas who may have caught the pathogen from farm animals and then spread it to military camps in Europe. �cientists always assumed the next pandemic would be a respiratory influenza,�he said. �e were wrong with Covid, but it� these kinds of viruses that keep us awake at night.� The virus has also been coursing through Asia, the Middle East and Europe. In recent weeks, 300 outbreaks have been reported in 29 European countries. In Israel, an outbreak at a nature reserve killed thousands of cranes. At the moment turkey farmers, especially those in Indiana and Kentucky, are most worried. Over the past two weeks, several farms in those states have been shuttered after officials discovered the virus among birds that spend their entire lives crammed into massive sheds. Farmers say they have been stunned by how efficiently the virus kills, with animals dying hours after the initial infection. In Indiana, state officials have moved quickly, euthanizing more than 100,000 birds and throwing a six-mile cordon around affected farms � containment area within which exports are halted and birds are tested daily. �veryone is on super-high alert and trying to be as prepared as possible because we all remember the devastation of 2014 and 2015,�aid Dr. Denise Heard, a veterinarian with the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. The 2014-15 outbreak is considered the most destructive in the nation� history. It sent poultry and egg prices soaring and cost the industry more than $3 billion �hough the federal government compensated farmers for lost flocks. In the end, nearly 50 million birds were killed by the virus or destroyed to prevent its spread, a vast majority of them in Iowa and Minnesota. John Burkel, 54, a fourth-generation turkey grower in northern Minnesota, has been watching the spread with trepidation. In 2015, the virus tore through his farm in a matter of days, leaving just 70 survivors in a shed that had held 7,000 birds. The weeks that followed were spent culling, composting the dead and then repeatedly disinfecting the barns. As a precaution, health officials also advised that he and his son take a course of the antiviral drug Tamiflu. �e�e never seen a virus that virulent,�aid Mr. Burkel, a state legislator who works the farm with his wife and two children. �t was just horrible.� Since then, agriculture officials across the country have pushed farmers to embrace an array of biosecurity measures aimed at preventing outbreaks. They include sealing up tiny holes that might allow mice or sparrows to enter barns, disinfecting the tires of feed-delivery trucks before they enter a farm and creating �lean�nd �irty�ones where workers can change into fresh footwear and coveralls before stepping inside an animal containment shed. At the same time, experts say that federal officials have strengthened the nationwide system of surveillance that allows researchers to track, in almost real time, an avian flu� spread within wild bird populations. � think the crisis of 2015 made us realize it takes a village to prevent an outbreak and has left us much better prepared,�aid Dr. Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian at Iowa State University who advises local farmers about improving their biosecurity practices. But hypervigilance has its limits, especially against a microscopic pathogen that can infiltrate a barn on the leg of a single housefly. For a growing number of scientists, the real threat is the nation� industrialized system of meat and dairy production, with its reliance on genetically identical creatures packed by the thousands inside huge confinement sheds. Nearly all the nine billion chickens raised and slaughtered in the United States each year can trace their lineage to a handful of breeds that have been manipulated to favor fast growth and plump breasts. The birds are also exceptionally vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. �hey all have the same immune system, or lack of an immune system, so once a virus gets inside a barn, it� going to spread like wildfire,�aid Dr. Hansen, the public health veterinarian. Andrew deCoriolis, the executive director of Farm Forward, a sustainable agriculture advocacy group, said the lack of genetic diversity isn� just a threat to the nation� food supply; it is also a potential threat to public health. More than half the 22 strains of novel influenza virus that the C.D.C. has identified as �f special concern�o human health are avian influenza viruses, he said, noting that a 2018 study examining the emergence of 39 highly pathogenic avian viruses found that all but two of them had emerged on industrial poultry farms. He said the sector� emphasis on biosecurity and infection containment obscures a larger, thornier issue that requires a fundamental rethinking of meat and egg production in the United States. �nstead of asking how factory farms can prevent infections that originate in the environment, which is how they frame it now, we should be asking how they can prevent infections that originate on factory farms,�e said. �f we keep raising more and more animals in these conditions, we should expect the exact outcome we�e getting because that� how the system is set up.� Young turkeys at an Iowa barn in 2015, after a devastating avian influenza outbreak that year.

Everybody has to pay more. It� just sad.� Egg prices more than doubled nationally in March, according to the Urner Barry Egg Index, a blend of egg values in the wholesale market. That� in part because of the drastic measures taken to try to curb the spread of the mutating bird flu virus, the worst outbreak since 2014-2015. More than 24 million domestic chickens, turkey and other domestic birds have been killed in the U.S. since February. While the risk to people is low with this outbreak, scientists have rising concerns about the increasing threats of animal-borne viruses spreading to people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends farmers, poultry workers and hunters take steps to protect themselves and contain the virus. No human cases have been documented from this strain of the avian flu in the U.S., and only one was reported in Europe, said Todd Davis, lead of the CDC� zoonotic virus team in virology surveillance. Eating poultry and eggs is safe, as long as they are fully cooked, the CDC said. BIRD FLU: Bald eagles in 14 states have died amid bird flu outbreak OUTBREAK: Zoos are sequestering birds as avian flu spreads across North America Among birds, avian flu can be deadly and spread rapidly. When it� detected in a commercial poultry flock, federal rules require the birds to be killed to try to �tamp out�he virus, said Bryan Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey� National Wildlife Health Center. One Iowa farm laid off more than 200 employees after an outbreak forced the destruction of 5.3 million laying hens. The farm deaths ignited protests among animal rights activists. A woman quickly dubbed �lue girl�as removed from an NBA game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Los Angeles Clippers on April 13 after she sprayed adhesive on the court and tried to glue herself to the floor to protest the euthanasia of birds on a farm belonging to Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor. Zoos in at least a half dozen states have shuttered aviaries to protect their birds. Backyard flock owners are keeping their chickens in and trying to keep wild waterfowl out of farm ponds to protect their birds. After the virus was reported in 41 countries during the latter half of 2021, U.S. and Canadian officials were on high alert, swabbing live birds and ducks taken by hunters to monitor for it, Richards said. This strain of the avian flu made its first appearance in North America in late November, in great black backed gulls in Newfoundland, where birds sometimes land after being blown across the Atlantic from Europe. By April 18, the virus had taken flight in the U.S. and was reported in more than 230 counties in 37 states and at least six Canadian provinces. In addition to domestic chickens, turkeys and ducks, USGS data shows at least 32 species of wild birds have been infected in the U.S., including bald eagles, snowy owls, swans and white pelicans. This virus is not related to the still unidentified pathogen that made songbirds sick last year, Richards said. Maps of the outbreak this spring showed the flu moving along the Missouri River basin, �ery clearly on the wings�n migrating waterfowl, Richards said. But the timing was fortunate because the flu began spreading just as the birds were dispersing, rather than being gathered in large winter congregations that could be �irus factories,�e said. An outbreak in Israel where 40,000 common cranes were gathered killed 8,000 of them in a matter of weeks. Scientists are monitoring avian flu and other pathogens in animals more closely than ever because of the rising threat the viruses could spread to people, or back and forth between people and animals, mutating into different strains as they go. The opportunities for new emerging pathogens to appear and spill over into people has increased in recent decades, researchers said. For example, Richards pointed to the COVID-19 virus, which was found in a host of captive and wild animals, including lions, tigers, gorillas, cats, dogs, deer and mink. �e�e created opportunities where wildlife, humans and domestic animals literally share time and space,\" he said. \"Pathogens can leverage those opportunities.� That potential has prompted calls from some scientists to strengthen reporting techniques and information sharing around the world to minimize the risk of another global pandemic. This H5 strain of the avian flu has been evolving in the world� birds since the late 1990s, mutating and swapping genes with other avian influenza, said the CDC� Davis. One version of the virus has caused 863 human infections in 18 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. Of those, 455 were fatal. The strain circulating now lacks genetic characteristics associated with human infection. While catastrophic to poultry, the CDC considers the risk low to humans. The single European case was a person with no symptoms and prolonged exposure to ducks that lived indoors, Davis said. People who may be exposed by handling wild birds or working in affected commercial operations should be aware of the potential for infection and take extra precautions. For example, hunters and individuals handling wild birds should wash their hands. People working to decontaminate poultry farms are advised to wear N95 face masks and gloves, and in some cases protective gowns. Davis said these people should also get tested if they experience any flu symptoms. �here� still things we don� know,�uch as the overall potential for exposure, he said. �o we want to be extra cautious, especially with the highly pathogenic strains.� INDIANA FARM: Bird flu found on poultry farm in Indiana, nearly 30,000 turkeys killed to contain spread Dead birds should be reported to state wildlife hotlines and bird watchers have been advised to avoid spreading mud from wetlands and swampy areas with their boots, cars and equipment. American Poultry Association members who raise birds for enjoyment and show have also worked to protect their flocks from exposure, said David Adkins, secretary/treasurer and a competition judge. Georgia state officials canceled the association� semi-annual show in February. Similar shows and fair exhibitions have been canceled in at least five states, including Iowa, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Adkins said he feels bad for youths in 4-H and Future Farmers of America chapters who haven� been able to display the poultry they�e raised. Using toy stuffed birds to demonstrate their showmanship just isn� the same, he said: �t� hard on those kids when they spent the time raising their project.� Richards and other scientists hope to see the impacts of the virus diminish as spring migration comes to a close. And they hope this outbreak doesn� match the 2014-15 season, when 50 million birds were killed.

Outbreaks of avian influenza have killed wild birds including dozens of bald eagles and lead to death through sickness or culling of tens of millions of poultry raised for meat and eggs in recent months. \"It spreads very quickly in poultry, makes poultry very sick, and can be lethal,\" said Troy Sutton, an assistant professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Pennsylvania State University. The high transmissibility of this version of H5N1 among poultry and the increase in cases from late 2021 into this year had raised concerns among officials and disease experts of potential exposure to humans in the U.S., Dr. Sutton said. The risk to most people remains low, the CDC said on Thursday, but the agency advised people who work in proximity to infected birds to take extra precautions including wearing gloves, medical face masks and goggles. People in close contact with infected birds can be exposed to the virus through a bird's saliva, mucus and feces. \"When there is human infection with these viruses, often it can be severe,\" said Richard Webby, member of the department of infectious diseases at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. \"The case fatality rate is much higher with this virus than it is for a typical seasonal, human influenza infection.\" Among over 800 detected human cases of H5N1 globally from 2003 to March 2022, the case fatality rate was 53%, according to the World Health Organization. Most deaths associated with H5N1 viruses were caused by severe pneumonia and a collapse of the respiratory system, Dr. Webby said. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the risk of avian influenza spreading more widely to humans are low but not zero. \" Viruses change quite quickly, and we've seen that with Covid,\" Dr. Poulsen said. \"Flu does change, and when you get a strain that will move species to species, we need to know about it right away because it could create another infectious disease outbreak.\" Contagious Bird Flu Presents Low Risk to People After Colorado Case", "media_outlet": "WSJ", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate of 53% for H5N1 globally but does not provide nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.", "spread_risk": "yes", "spread_feedback": "AFFIRMS RISK: 2, 3, 4 + \"The high transmissibility of this version of H5N1 among poultry and the increase in cases from late 2021 into this year had raised concerns among officials and disease experts of potential exposure to humans in the U.S., Dr. Sutton said.\" + \"When there is human infection with these viruses, often it can be severe,\" said Richard Webby, member of the department of infectious diseases at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. \"The case fatality rate is much higher with this virus than it is for a typical seasonal, human influenza infection.\" + \"Viruses change quite quickly, and we've seen that with Covid,\" Dr. Poulsen said. \"Flu does change, and when you get a strain that will move species to species, we need to know about it right away because it could create another infectious disease outbreak.\" DENIES RISK: 1, 2, 4, 5 + \"the risk of broader spread in people remains low\", \"The risk to most people remains low\", \"the risk of avian influenza spreading more widely to humans are low but not zero\""}
{"id": "148", "title": "First recent US case of human bird flu confirmed in Colorado", "date": "2022-04-29", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) � Colorado prison inmate has become the first person in the U.S. to test positive for bird flu in a recent outbreak that has led to the deaths of millions of chickens and turkeys, but federal officials say they still see little threat to the general public. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday evening that the infected man had been in a prerelease program and was helping to remove chickens from an infected farm. The man, who was under age 40, reported fatigue for a few days but has recovered, state health and CDC officials said in a statement. The man was isolated and is being treated with an antiviral drug. Other people involved in the bird removal operation in Colorado have tested negative, but they are being retested out of an abundance of caution. The man was part of a crew of inmates nearing release who had been working at the farm before a case of bird flu was confirmed there on April 19, said Lisa Wiley, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Corrections. When bird flu was detected at the farm in Montrose County, the inmates were asked to help kill and remove the birds. Agriculture officials have reported an outbreak at one Montrose County farm with 58,000 broiler breeder chickens. Despite the infection, the CDC considers the threat to the general public to be low because spread of the virus to people requires close contact with an infected bird. Signals that could raise the public health risk might include multiple reports of virus infections in people from exposure to birds, or identification of spread from one person to another. The CDC also is monitoring for genetic changes to the H5N1 bird flu virus that is currently circulating. Any genetic changes could indicate the virus is adapting to spread more readily from birds to people or other mammals. Many different bird flu viruses have infected humans worldwide since at least the 1990s, but health officials still say human infection is uncommon. In 2002, H7N2 caused pinkeye and mild respiratory symptoms in people in the U.K. and the U.S. Four U.S. infections have been identified since 2002; two were transmitted from cats to humans in 2016. More than 1,500 people in China have been infected with the H7N9 strain, largely in outbreaks between 2013 and 2017. This version caused serious infections among people and 40% of those who were hospitalized died. A different variant of H5N1 has also circulated since 1997, infecting more than 880 people, and it had a 50% case fatality rate. The current H5N1 variant has been spreading among backyard and commercial chicken and turkey flocks in the U.S. since late February. Viruses have been found in U.S. commercial and backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states. More than 35 million chickens and turkeys have been killed and removed to avoid spread, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported. The CDC said it has tracked the health of more than 2,500 people who have been exposed to H5N1-infected birds but that the inmate's illness was the only confirmed case to date. The agency said it was possible the man only had the virus present in his nose and that his body was not infected. Colorado public health officials say repeat testing on the man was negative for influenza. A nasal swab positive test result meets the agency's criteria for considering it an infection. �he appropriate public health response at this time is to assume this is an infection and take actions to contain and treat,�he CDC statement said. ___ Associated Press reporter Colleen Slevin in Denver contributed to this report.

The CDC did not reveal the neuraminidase subtype of the virus � he N portion of an influenza A virus�ame. The country is currently experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in both wild birds and in commercial poultry flocks. uthorities in Colorado are monitoring the health of about 10 people who were in contact with a man who tested positive for H5 bird flu when he was involved in culling poultry infected with the virus. The man, who is incarcerated at a state correctional facility and was taking part in a pre-release work program, is being considered the country’s first case of H5 bird flu. The people being monitored worked with him and shared transportation to the poultry operation. State Epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy said Friday that all the individuals have tested twice for the virus and all tests have been negative so far. They were all offered the flu antiviral Tamiflu, which can be used both to treat and prevent flu infections, though Herlihy wasn’t certain all had agreed to take it. They will be monitored for 10 days after their last exposure to the unidentified man, who she said had recovered from a very mild illness. “We’re being cautious,” Herlihy told STAT. “We’re using isolation, we’re using treatment, we’re monitoring contacts doing all of those things. But we continue to believe that the risk overall is low.” In reality, it’s not clear the man was infected. Workers who were culling the birds underwent daily symptom checks; on April 20, they were tested using nose swabs. On April 26, the state’s public health laboratory concluded the man had been infected with an influenza A virus, but it was unable to subtype the virus. The sample was then sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which confirmed on April 27 that the swab contained H5 virus. The subtyping of the neuraminidase the N in the virus’ name is still underway, but the presumption is that the birds and the man were infected with H5N1 viruses. The man was placed in isolation on April 26, after the state laboratory could not subtype the virus, Lisa Wiley, a public affairs officer for the Colorado Department of Corrections, said in an email. The move was taken out of an abundance of caution, she said. In interviews with public health officials after the fact, the man acknowledged feeling fatigued for a few days around the time the test was taken. But he reported none of the respiratory symptoms normally associated with flu. In a statement issued by the CDC on Thursday evening, the agency raised the possibility that the man may not have been infected the swab may have just picked up the virus in his nostrils. But the positive test means he meets the definition of a case, the CDC said. “There’s some additional work that CDC can do, but we might not ever know if this was truly an infection or not,” said Herlihy. For years countries have been on high alert for H5N1 infections in people. In the mid-aughts, these viruses labeled as highly pathogenic, because of their lethality to poultry spread from Southeast Asia to South Asia and North Africa, leaving devastation in their wake. Millions of birds died from the virus or from the culling needed to stop the virus’ spread. And occasionally the virus jumped from poultry to people. In the past 20 years or so, roughly 880 people in 19 countries have been infected with H5N1. Just over half of them died. Fortunately, though, the virus to date has not acquired the capacity to spread easily from person to person and the fears that an H5N1 pandemic might be looming have faded. This case is unlikely to reignite them. The virus has changed over time, Todd Davis, who leads the CDC influenza division’s zoonotic virus team, said in an interview. The H5N1 viruses from 15 years ago or so had some different genes that appeared to allow them to trigger more severe illness when they infected people, he said. Those changes, particularly in the polymerase gene, are not present in most current day H5N1 viruses. And while the virus is still called H5N1, at a point a few years back it swapped genes with another flu virus, picking up a different neuraminidase. The new N1 is highly adapted to infect wild birds speeding its recent spread through Europe, Africa and North America but it seems less able now to infect people, Davis said. Since that reassortment event, the newly configured H5N1 has only been seen to have infected two people a man in the United Kingdom last December and the man in Colorado. The U.K. man kept poultry and the virus found its way into his flock. Though he tested positive, he experienced no symptoms. “There have only been two detected human cases since the virus was first detected in 2018,” Davis said. “That’s also pretty good evidence that this virus is just not as capable of infecting or causing disease in humans.” Still, flu viruses change constantly, and public health officials do not take lightly human infections with non-human flu viruses. “Our challenge at the moment is trying to keep up with those hundreds of people who are involved in culling operations or disinfection of infected farms, and making sure that we don’t see any changes in the virus that might increase the propensity for severe illness or transmissibility,” Davis said. “We’re still very much on high alert.”", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "yes", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that just over half of the roughly 880 people infected with H5N1 in the past 20 years have died.

Here's what it is, what to know about its symptoms", "date": "2022-04-29", "fulltext": "The worst avian flu outbreak in years is ripping through the United States, leading to the deaths of more than 24 million birds. The H5N1 virus has ravaged commercial and backyard poultry in 29 states, with nearly 250 outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control. American consumers have felt the bird flu in the form of higher egg prices, which more than doubled in March. But on Thursday, the CDC reported the first human case of the current dominant bird flu virus in the United States. An inmate in Colorado contracted the flu after exposure while working at a poultry farm. Still, public health officials say the risk of transmission in the general public is low. Bird flu's economic impact: Worst bird flu in years drives up egg prices, prompts precautions against spread to humans What is the bird flu? The bird flu, also known as the avian flu, refers to the disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted between birds. The dominant virus strain circulating currently is called H5N1. It is extremely contagious among birds, who spread it by shedding the virus in their saliva, feces and through nasal secretions. The virus originates in wild birds, but can spread to domesticated birds and lead to rapid, massive outbreaks. Avian influenza viruses are classified into two groups: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high death rates in infected birds, according to the CDC. Bird Flu symptoms in humans While possible, avian flu virus infections in humans are considered rare. The human infection reported in Colorado is only the second confirmed human infection of the present outbreak in the world. The first confirmed infection was reported in December in a United Kingdom man who had ducks living inside his home. He presented no symptoms. The man infected in Colorado showed mild symptoms of fatigue and was given antiviral medication for treatment. In China, officials confirmed the infection of a 4-year-old boy with a different strain, H3N8, after he reported a fever. Chinese health officials said his close contacts tested negative and that the strain posed little threat of wide spread. Bird flu symptoms have been reported to be largely the same as the seasonal flu. Symptoms can include cough, a sore throat, head and muscle aches, fatigue and shortness of breath. Severe infections can lead to pneumonia that requires hospitalizations. Sometimes infection can cause a fever. Less common symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization reported that 863 H5N1 cases have been confirmed globally in 18 countries since 2003, causing 455 deaths. But the H5N1 virus in circulation now is different from prior versions, the CDC said, and the risk posed by bird flu to the public's health is still low. Human to human transmission is rare. �ven when people have been infected with bird flu viruses there has rarely been onward spread from one infected person to another person,�he CDC website reads. Most people who become infected become so after �lose, prolonged and unprotected contact with infected birds.� Bird Flu prevention The best personal bird flu prevention is steering clear of prolonged exposure to birds. For those who work in close contact with poultry, hunt, or keep birds of their own, the CDC recommends implementing extra precautions like wearing gloves, mask and eye protection.

{"id": "170", "title": "Geese, skuas, cranes and even foxes: avian flu takes growing toll on wildlife", "date": "2022-06-01", "fulltext": "One ecologist counted 160 dead wild birds while walking round a Scottish loch, and figures from other countries are just as worrying As he walked along the shoreline of a Highland loch on a fine May evening, ecologist and wildlife photographer Peter Stronach could hardly believe what he was seeing. The beach was littered with dead and dying birds: male eider ducks, several species of gulls, a gannet, a puffin and no fewer than 26 pink-footed geese, which should by now have been on the way back to their Icelandic breeding grounds. In all, Stronach recorded 72 individual birds of 17 species at Loch Fleet national nature reserve on the east coast of Scotland on that one day, plus many more in the following days. But these birds had not been killed by a passing predator; nor were they the hapless victims of a sudden storm at sea. The cause of these deaths was a highly infectious �nd for birds, usually lethal �irus. Avian influenza H5N1 or, as it is more commonly known, bird flu, is back with a vengeance. What really worries Stronach is the range of species he found. �arlier this spring, we noticed that avian flu was restricted to the geese; but since then it has spread to other wildfowl, raptors and seabirds.� In previous years, it mainly occurred in winter; now, he says, it is affecting the breeding populations of iconic coastal species such as the eider. Elsewhere in Scotland earlier this month about 20 great skuas were found dead or dying on Fair Isle, with more reported from other breeding colonies on the Shetland Isles. This followed a serious outbreak of bird flu in 2021, when hundreds of skuas died. For any species, these deaths are a serious setback, especially at the height of the breeding season. But for great skuas and pink-footed geese, this news is especially troubling. Scotland hosts 60% of the global breeding population of great skuas, and 90% of the world population of pink-footed geese overwinter in the UK. For these two species, both of which are on the amber list of birds of conservation concern, bird flu could pose a serious threat to their long-term future. Bird flu is by no means confined to the UK. In December 2021, an outbreak in the Hula valley, in northern Israel, killed more than 5,000 cranes out of a wintering population of 30,000 birds. In what the Israeli government called �he deadliest wildlife disaster in the nation� history� workers wearing hazmat suits were photographed collecting the corpses. After the outbreak, farmers were instructed to slaughter hundreds of thousands of chickens. In Canada, a deadly strain of bird flu has already ravaged the poultry industry, resulting in almost 2 million chickens being killed. Now it has transferred not only to wild birds but mammals too. While the disease is usually confined to waterbirds, this particular strain has attacked crows, jays, gulls, raptors and even young foxes. The US is suffering what looks to become the worst ever outbreak of bird flu �hich farmers are blaming on transmission from wild birds. More than 37 million chickens and turkeys have so far been culled, with more to come. If just one bird tests positive, the farmers must destroy the entire flock. As one report noted: �n Wisconsin, lines of dump trucks have taken days to collect masses of bird carcasses and pile them in unused fields. Neighbours live with the stench of the decaying birds.�ven the bald eagle, America� national bird, has been affected. Could it also affect humans? The answer is, in very rare cases, yes �sually those, such as farmworkers, who have been in close and prolonged contact with infected domesticated birds. From 2003 to 2021, almost 500 people around the world died after catching the virus. Clearly, bird flu is something we need to take seriously. But Stronach is concerned that the current monitoring and surveillance system is designed to protect commercial poultry firms, and is not really adequate for wild bird populations. �e need urgent research to find out what other species it is found in, and, crucially, the mechanisms by which it is spreading,�e says. He is especially concerned that if dead birds are not collected after an outbreak, they may be scavenged by buzzards, red kites, gulls and skuas, thus spreading the disease even faster. Anyone who finds a dead or dying wild bird, which they suspect might have the disease, should not touch the corpse; nor should they attempt to rescue it if it is still alive.

We�e also seen island birds affected, resulting in the shutdown of human visitors to the Isle of May in Scotland for five weeks, among other measures. Avian flu is known as one of the most infectious diseases: the R number, which was often discussed for the spread of Covid-19, can be as high as 100 for avian flu, meaning one bird can infect as many as 100 others. And the past few months have seen exponential spread of the virus, with Britain and Europe hit especially hard. A lab in Surrey that tests samples says it has seen a 600% increase in cases in the past three months. Why is this outbreak causing concern not just among scientists but also poultry farmers and government officials? Currently, avian flu outbreaks have been limited in humans because the virus doesn� spread easily between us. But this is a ticking timebomb. A mutation that makes this virus circulate more easily between humans is possible. This would be a gamechanger and raise the risk to humans considerably. And the more chances the virus has to jump into a human and mutate, the more likely it is a dangerous strain will emerge that could set off the next pandemic. While humans have been infected by birds, they are usually workers on poultry farms and those in close contact with infected birds, and even these instances have been rare. For example, on 3 November, two farm workers in Spain tested positive; it was the second known infection of humans in Europe since 2003. Infection is usually through handling sick or dead birds. Infected birds have the flu virus in their saliva, blood, mucus and faeces, and humans can get infected if they get this virus into the eyes, nose or mouth, or inhale droplets in close range (you can� get infected with avian flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs). And this virus is not mild. The fatality rate is thought to be high in humans: the World Health Organizationestimate is roughly 60% for H5N1. We currently have no vaccine to use in humans; nor does the seasonal flu vaccine work against avian flu. But while the chance of human transmission is a future worry, right now the virus is affecting people� livelihoods and farms, and putting hundreds of millions of domestic and wild birds in danger. Outbreaks in chickens can kill the entire local population; in other birds, such as ducks and geese, the disease is often mild or even asymptomatic. Ducks have even been called the �rojan horses�or the virus, given their ability to carry it and infect others while remaining unaffected themselves. Bird flu is highly infectious and poses a high risk to chickens and turkeys. As a result, if a farm tests positive for bird flu, the entire flock is culled. This can lead to hundreds of thousands to millions of pounds in lost income, and places enormous strain on poultry farms. It also has implications for the price and availability of turkeys and chickens going into Thanksgiving and Christmas. And, of course, it is a tremendous loss of bird life. The heart of the issue is how we raise and treat animals, and their interactions with humans. Poultry are often kept in difficult conditions where they are packed into close quarters and diseases easily pass through them. Some experts think that this more infectious strain developed in an industrial factory environment, where animals are kept in close quarters and viruses have the chance to circulate and mutate. And this is not just an issue with avian flu, but other infectious diseases as well. In places such as China and India, antibiotics are freely given to animals in order to prevent infection (especially in industrial farming) and to make them as large as possible. A survey of chicken farmers in China found that they all used antibiotics. The rationale here is cheap and fast meat to meet the growing demand in emerging economies. But this creates its own problems. Feeding antibiotics to animals can lead to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, and then humans such as farmers becoming infected with antibiotic-resistant infections. These then circulate in humans and reduce the effectiveness of one of the most powerful drugs in modern medicine. Chemotherapy, infections and surgeries of all kinds have become safer because of antibiotics. If the drugs don� work, these procedures become high-risk and life-threatening, as they used to be in the pre-antibiotic era. And as we�e learned, all it takes is for a person to get on a plane with a novel infectious disease for it soon to become a problem for everywhere else in the world. The major infectious disease threats in humans tend to come from animals: think of Sars-CoV-2, Sars, Mers, Ebola �he list goes on. There are more than a million viruses circulating in the animal kingdom, and it would be a fool� errand to try to stop that circulation. But we can limit the chances these have to jump into the human population, and limit their circulation in domestic animals. This requires taking the animal-human interface seriously, and knowing that while it� a major economic, animal welfare and farming problem now, the situation becoming even worse is just a mutation away. * Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate of roughly 60% for H5N1 according to the World Health Organization estimate.
