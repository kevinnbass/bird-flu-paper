        "fulltext": "(CNN) \ufffd A volcano in Indonesia is erupting in spectacular fashion, prompting thousands of evacuations as\nairlines cancel flights. Local authorities have even warned a tsunami could be triggered by \"volcanic material\ncollapsing into the ocean.\"\nHere's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.\n1. Campus protests\nPro-Palestinian protests continue to rock college campuses across the country, with some teens and parents now\nreconsidering their enrollment decisions. Students nationwide have only a few days left to submit their college\ndeposits and make their decisions on where to enroll for the fall, and many protests have impacted the logistics of\nvisiting schools. On Wednesday, police deemed the UCLA encampment an unlawful assembly, with officials\nsaying many protesters were unaffiliated with the university. They also ordered people to disperse or face arrest.\nLaw enforcement overnight began pulling aside barricades and making their way back into the UCLA\nencampment, prompting more tense clashes, according to a CNN team on the ground.\n2. Abortion\nThe Arizona Senate on Wednesday voted to repeal the state's 160-year-old near-total abortion ban, three weeks\nafter the state Supreme Court revived the controversial law. The bill next heads to the desk of Democratic Gov.\nKatie Hobbs, who said Wednesday that she looks forward \"to quickly signing the repeal into law.\" The legislation\nwould clear the way for Arizona's 15-week limit to remain in place. On the same day, Vice President Kamala\nHarris traveled to Florida hours after a ban on most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy went into effect in the\nstate. At a campaign event, she laid out in stark terms what a second Trump administration would mean for\nwomen across the country: \"More bans, more suffering, less freedom.\"\n3. Bird flu\nOngoing testing of milk and dairy products by the FDA has not found any active H5N1 bird flu virus in nearly 300\nsamples of products purchased in grocery stores, the agency said Wednesday. The FDA has tested samples of\nmilk and other kinds of products made from milk, like cheese and sour cream, as well as products made with milk\npowder, such as infant and toddler formula. This comes as the government is also testing samples of raw and\ncooked ground beef purchased at grocery stores to evaluate and contain a bird flu outbreak among dairy cows\nthat has spread to about three dozen herds in nine states. The highest concentration of infected cattle is in Texas,\nwhere 12 herds have tested positive.\n4. Interest rates\nThe Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is holding interest rates at their current levels for the sixth straight\nmeeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues previously penciled in three rate cuts this year, but that\nnow looks very much in doubt. Questions had even been raised as to whether the economy is so hot that the Fed\nmay need to hike rates, but Powell dispelled that notion in his post-meeting news conference. He said a\npersistently strong economy, coupled with inflation continuing to stall, would simply result in the Fed holding off on\ncutting rates, but added that an \"unexpected weakening in the labor market\" could speed up the timing of the first\ncut. Data shows the job market overall remains robust, with unemployment still under 4% and employers\ncontinuing to hire workers at a brisk pace.\n5. Electric vehicles\nTesla has abruptly fired the team running its electric vehicle charging business, raising doubts about the future of\none of the largest US charging networks. A lack of charging infrastructure is one of the main barriers to\nwidespread EV adoption, and Tesla's extensive \"Supercharger\" network has long been a major selling point for its\nvehicles. The move also blindsided other carmakers, such as General Motors and Ford, which planned to use the\nnetwork. Still, experts say the EV market is not collapsing, but rather entering a new phase in which consumers\nare demanding more affordable models. Worldwide sales of plug-in vehicles will rise around 20% this year\ncompared to 2023, according to a report from the International Energy Agency.\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nMan draws a huge crowd while eating 700 cheeseballs in 30 minutes\nWatch this man eat hundreds of cheddar cheese balls in front of a New York City crowd \ufffd a true superhero origin\nstory.\nDave and Buster's is getting into the betting business\nThe restaurant and entertainment chain wants to allow small bets on arcade games, but some fans remain\nskeptical.\nPrincess Charlotte turns 9!\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales released this sweet photo of their daughter to mark the occasion.\nScientists reveal the face of a Neanderthal who lived 75,000 years ago\nA Neanderthal was buried 75,000 years ago, and experts painstakingly pieced together what she looked like.

When\nthe person indicated the presence of symptoms, public health workers took samples, offered antiviral medications\nto them and their close contacts, and urged them to isolate.\nThe CDC received the samples on Tuesday and reported the test results to Michigan health officials that night,\nsaid Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC.\n\"This case was not unexpected,\" Shah said Wednesday, emphasizing the agency's ongoing efforts to help farms\nprepare for the spread of the virus. \"It does not change our assessment of the risk overall. What it does do,\nhowever, is it reinforces the message that CDC has been putting out since late March, which is that entities\ninvolved with this \ufffd be they local health departments, farms, farm workers and farm worker organizations \ufffd ought\nto be alert but not alarmed by these developments.\n\"We have not seen evidence of other cases in this area or elsewhere in any of our monitoring systems, let alone\nany evidence of human-to-human transmission,\" he said. \"And this is reassuring, but the work of public health is\nnot done. In the coming days, we'll have additional information on the genomic sequence or the DNA fingerprint of\nthis particular virus. And we'll be able to compare it to the virus from infected cows in Michigan, as well as to\ncompare it to the virus from the earlier human case in Texas.\"\nThe fact that the nasal specimen tested negative while the eye swab was positive is also, \"in a sense,\nreassuring,\" Shah said, as it indicates a reduced likelihood that the virus is spreading through respiration.\nAlthough remnants of the virus have been found in samples of dairy products purchased from grocery stores, the\nUS Food and Drug Administration \"continues to affirm our assessment of the safety of the commercial milk\nsupply,\" Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said\nWednesday.\n\"To date, the totality of the evidence \ufffd including studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization against multiple\npathogens, recent studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization of [highly pathogenic avian influenza] and eggs\nat lower temperatures than generally used in dairy products, and negative retail sample results to date \ufffd continue\nto indicate the commercial milk supply is safe. We also continue to strongly advise against the consumption of\nraw milk\" or milk that has not been pasteurized.\nTesting with a substitute virus in ground beef found some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, but it\nwas present at \"much, much reduced levels,\" according to Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly\npathogenic avian influenza at the US Department of Agriculture, and it's not clear whether it would be enough to\nmake someone sick.\nCorrection: A previous version of this report misidentified the genetic strain of the virus.",

While most human infections in the current outbreak have been mild and self-limiting,\neach new host gives the virus a chance to get better at infecting people.\n\"To be clear, we have no evidence so far that this virus can easily infect human beings or that it can spread\nbetween human beings easily in a sustained fashion,\" said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at\nthe Brown University School of Public Health. \"If it did have those abilities, we would be in a pandemic.\n\"The second we know that someone gave it to someone else relatively easily, that's a new pandemic, and it will\nbe around the globe, you know, probably in a matter of weeks,\" Nuzzo said at a seminar hosted by the Health\nCoverage Fellowship.\nThe concern comes as scientists are urgently trying to solve the mystery of how a person in Missouri who had no\ncontact with animals became infected by a type of bird flu.\nFew details have been released. The person had \"significant underlying health conditions\" that probably made\nthem more susceptible to the infection, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention said in a news briefing on Thursday. The patient tested positive for the flu after being\nhospitalized on August 22, was treated with antiviral medications and has since recovered and returned home.\nAdditional testing by the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory confirmed the patient had a type of H5 flu, which\nis an uncommon subtype. So far, only 13 other H5 infections have been seen in humans in the US this year.\nAside from the Missouri case, all have been in farm workers who had been in direct contact with infected birds or\ncows.\nThe CDC has confirmed the Missouri case was an H5 infection and is now trying to sequence the rest of the virus'\ngenome to find out if it is related to those infecting poultry and dairy cattle. It's not clear if the agency's scientists\nwill be successful since there was little virus in the patient's samples to work with. So far, CDC scientists had\nbeen able to sequence only part of the virus' genetic material.\n\"The data that we do have and that have been generated thus far show an H5 virus that is closely related to the\nH5 virus circulating among dairy cows,\" Shah said.\nInvestigators have also interviewed the patient and are tracing their recent contacts. So far, there's no indication\nthat the person passed the infection to anyone else, and there's no unusual flu activity in the area where the\nperson lives, Shah said.\n\"Seeing that someone is in the hospital with possible H5N1 heightens my worry,\" Nuzzo said. \"It not only\nheightens my worry for the farm workers,\" who are most at risk from infection, she said, \"but it also heightens the\nworry that this we're allowing this virus to gain new abilities.\"\nWith herds on the move, risk increases\nH5N1 caught scientists by surprise when an outbreak in US dairy cattle emerged in March. New cases slowed in\nthe summer, when dairy cows move around less, partly due to heat, and partly because demand for milk drops\nduring the summer, when school is out, said Dr. Eric Deeble, deputy undersecretary for marketing and regulatory\nprograms at the USDA, said in a news briefing in August. But that starts to change in the fall, when farmers move\ncows so they can graze on the remnants of fields that have recently been harvested.\nGreater movement of cattle could give the H5N1 virus more opportunities to spread.\n\"It is always of concern when folks are moving animals,\" Deeble said.\nThe USDA has ordered the testing of dairy cows before they travel between states, but there's no such\nrequirement for cattle that are moving within the same state.\nThe order also doesn't require the testing of every animal within large groups, and there's concern that cows that\nare infected without symptoms may be moved undetected.\nThat concern was heightened after three dairy herds in California's Central Valley tested positive for H5N1 last\nmonth. As of September 12, the total number of infected herds in California had jumped to eight, Deeble said in a\nnews briefing on Thursday.\nCalifornia is home to about 1.7 million dairy cows, about one-sixth of the national total, making it the nation's\nlargest dairy producing state.\nHow and when the virus made its way to California is still under investigation. But genetic testing at the USDA's\nNational Veterinary Services Laboratories shows the virus that infecting the California herds is very closely\nrelated to the viruses that have infected more than 200 herds from 13 other states, Deeble said.\nThe first infections of cows with the H5N1 virus were confirmed in herds in Texas and Kansas in late March.\nEvolutionary biologists think cows became infected months earlier, perhaps around the first of the year, when the\nvirus likely spread from migrating birds who were carrying it.\nThe finding that the virus infecting the herds in California is genetically related to these first infections is important\nbecause it means they almost certainly are not the result of another crossover event from migrating birds to cows.\nInstead, the virus likely made its way to California through cow-to-cow spread that still hasn't been controlled.\n\"So we were dealing essentially with one variant from the very beginning of this outbreak,\" Deeble said in an\ninterview. \"That information has been shared back with California, and so they're continuing their epidemiological\ninvestigation with that knowledge in hand.\"\nWastewater testing has been picking up H5 viruses in California since March 18, said Dr. Marlene Wolfe,\nassistant professor of environmental health at Emory University and program director for WastewaterScan, a\nnonprofit monitoring network directed by researchers at Stanford and Emory universities and funded by Verily, the\nparent company of Google.\nCalifornia is one of nine states \ufffd out of 40 states being monitored in their network \ufffd where H5 viruses have\nbeen found in wastewater.\nWastewater testing can pick up viruses with the H5 proteins, but it can't tell whether those viruses came from\nbirds, cows, other animals, or even discarded milk that had found its way into the sewage system. So far, though,\nmost states that have had H5 proteins turn up in wastewater have also reported infected herds.\n\"So far, eight of these states have had outbreaks reported in cattle. The one state with an H5 detection that has\nnot had an H5N1 cattle outbreak is Arkansas,\" wrote Wolfe in an email.\nFlu viruses can swap genes\nThe increased movement of animals will come as seasonal flu viruses are picking up steam in the US, increasing\nthe likelihood that a person \ufffd probably a farmworker \ufffd could get infected with both bird flu and seasonal flu at\nthe same time.\nOne of the most dramatic ways flu viruses can change is a phenomenon called reassortment.\nFlu viruses are a little bit like tinker toys; they keep their genes in easy-to-detach segments. When two flu viruses\ninfect the same cell and get close together, they can simply swap these segments and give rise to viruses that\ncan sometimes have dramatic new properties.\nA reassortment event that gives rise to a new souped-up flu virus is rare but not unheard of. Reassortment of the\nflu viruses in pigs, which have similar flu receptors to humans, is believed to have given rise to the H1N1 virus\nthat caused the 2009 pandemic, for example. Reassorted flu strains are also thought to have caused pandemics\nin 1957 and 1968.\nSince 2010, the CDC has recommended annual flu vaccines for everyone six months of age and older. Still, less\nthan half of all adults and children in the US got a flu shot last year, according to CDC data.\nTo try to prevent a reassortment event, flu vaccines will be particularly important for people who work directly with\nfarm animals this year, the agency said.\nThe agency has asked states with infected herds to submit plans outlining how they will educate farm workers\nand deliver vaccines to those who want them. On Thursday, the CDC said it hoped to begin these intensive\noutreach efforts to farmworkers in October.\nIncreasing vaccination rates among farmworkers is going to be a tall order, said Bethany Alcauter, who is director\nof research and public health programs at the National Center for Farmworker Health.\n\"What we've been hearing everywhere is the number of farms and the number of dairy employees who are\ngetting [personal protective equipment] and getting information, accurate information, about bird flu is really in the\nminority,\" Alcauter said.\nThat's true for a variety of reasons, she said, starting with farming culture. Some trades, like construction, for\nexample, require safety training. The same is not true of farming.\n\"Health and safety training in agriculture isn't that common,\" Alcauter said. Because many dairy operations are\nsmall, they aren't usually covered by the government agency that oversees worker safety, the Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration, or OSHA.\nAlcauter's organization has been given about $4 million by the CDC to spread the word. She said they are\ncurrently taking applications from community groups and health centers to educate farmworkers about bird flu and\nencourage vaccination. She estimates they'll be able to fund 40 to 50 organizations.\nJust like in any population, there will be some individuals who are hesitant about vaccination, but in general, she\nsays, farmworkers tend to be accepting of vaccines because they often come from countries like Mexico and\nGuatemala that have large national vaccine campaigns.\nAdvocates for farmworkers say that while getting these workers vaccinated for seasonal flu viruses is a\nreasonable idea, those vaccines still don't protect them from the viruses they could get from poultry or cows.\nThough the government has ordered that nearly 5 million doses of H5N1 vaccine be packaged and made ready\nfor use, there are currently no plans to actually give these doses to anyone, including farmworkers, who are most\nat risk.\nThis policy stands in contrast to Finland, which has seen past H5N1 outbreaks on fur farms. Finland announced it\nwould begin vaccinating its farmworkers against H5N1 this summer.\nStopping the next pandemic\nAdam Kucharski, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Tropical Hygiene, says\nviruses that cause pandemics emerge in stages: They infect animals and establish a reservoir \ufffd that's stage one;\nthese animals infections cause isolated spillover infections into humans \ufffd stage two; spillovers cause localized\nclusters of human infections \ufffd stage three; widespread transmission among people is stage four.\nKucharski argues that the most feasible and impactful stage for pandemic prevention is at stage two, when there\nare spillovers that cause localized clusters of infections. He says with the recent clusters of infections of\nfarmworkers culling poultry in Colorado suggest the H5N1 outbreak in the US is in that second stage, when\nprevention efforts can be less costly and more impactful.\n\"So really it's those situations where you're starting to see evidence of ability to infect humans, but not ability to\nsustain transmission very easily where there's a prime potential for intervention,\" Kucharski said. But the US is\nnot doing enough to take advantage of the H5N1s currently limited spread, he said.\nKucharski points to an outbreak of H7N9 in 2013, as a prime example of a situation where this worked. People\nwere starting to catch this flu from live poultry markets in China, which subsequently shut down those markets\nand effectively stopped transmission of the virus.\n\"We haven't had an H7N9 pandemic. We haven't actually had many cases at all subsequently,\" Kucharski said.\nThe US is running a risk letting H5N1 infections continue to spread in cattle without more widespread testing, and\nthe world is watching.\n\"I think at the moment, the response doesn't seem to be at the level it needs to be for this kind of threat,\"\nKucharski said.\n\"I think we saw, even in the early stages of Covid, that a lot of countries, lot of Europe, lot the US, basically wasn't\nlooking hard enough for Covid, and then got caught out very badly when they realized that there was a lot more\ntransmission than the raw data suggested,\" Kucharski said.\n\"And so I think, particularly in this situation, getting a good grasp of what's going on is kind of key, and I think we\nhaven't been getting that anywhere near the scale we need to.\"\nUS to pay to develop bird flu tests\nThe CDC says the threat of the H5N1 virus is currently low. But federal agencies are taking steps to mitigate\ninfections, should they begin to spread more widely.\nOn Thursday, the CDC said it was awarding $5 million in funding to five commercial laboratories used by doctors\nand hospitals to develop tests to detect H5 viruses. Those labs include Labcorp, Quest Diagnostics, Aegis\nSciences Corporation, Ginkgo Bioworks and ARUP Laboratories. The agency is also looking to have these labs\ndevelop tests for Oropouche viruses, which are causing outbreaks in South America and Cuba.\nIn making the grants, Shah said the agency was trying to learn from mistakes made during past public health\nemergencies.\n\"Previously \ufffd CDC developed tests for emerging pathogens and then shared those tests with others, and then\nafter that, commercial labs would develop their own tests,\" Shah said during the briefing on Thursday. \"That\nprocess took time. Now with these new arrangements, commercial labs will be developing new tests for public\nhealth responses alongside CDC, not after CDC.\"",

With this\ncase, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow,\" Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief\nmedical executive for Michigan, said in a news release. \"Neither individual was wearing full personal protective\nequipment (PPE). This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is\nan important toolin preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms. We have not seen\nsigns of sustained human-to-human transmission, and the current health risk to the general public remains low.\"\nAbout 220 people are being monitored in Michigan because of potential exposure to the virus, Shah said.\nMichigan, the state with the highest number of dairy herds reported to be infected, is also beginning to conduct\nblood testing to see how many workers may have antibodies to the H5N1 virus, which would reflect past\ninfections or exposures.\nThe CDC agreed that the risk to the general public remains low. But this case highlights the elevated risk to those\nwho work with infected animals.\nThe CDC has recommended that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US\nDepartment of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with\nprotection.\n\"Previously, we focused on the importance of eye protection, given the conjunctivitis in the first two cases, but this\ncase also underscores the importance of barrier protection, things like masks and other forms of protection for\ndairy workers, particularly those who are working with affected cows,\" Shah said.\nResearch is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with\nthem.\nThis is the third human infection known to be caused by this highly pathogenic form of avian influenza that's\ncurrently infecting dairy cattle in the US. None of the three people had contact with each other, but all worked with\ncattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission. The other two cases involved eye\ninfections, or conjunctivitis. The most recent worker had some mild eye symptoms but was not diagnosed with\nconjunctivitis.\nThe person had direct contact with infected cattle and notified local health officials that they were feeling sick.\nTheir symptoms are described as mild.\nThe patient has been given the antiviral medication oseltamivir, the same active ingredient as Tamiflu, and they\nare isolating at home. Their family members have not developed symptoms, but they have also been offered\nantiviral medication as a precaution. None of the other workers at the dairy farm has gotten sick, and they are\nbeing monitored, the CDC said.\n\"Given the high magnitude of interactions between people and dairy cows as well as with contaminated milking\nequipment, it is unsurprising that there are more human infections,\" said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an infectious\ndisease specialist at Emory University who is studying how the virus is transmitting in dairy barns.\n\"Every time the virus is able to replicate in a person, there is the potential for the virus to adapt to humans and\ngain molecular features for replication in the respiratory tract and to spread person-to-person,\" Lakdawala said.\nFlu viruses are classified by two of the proteins that sit on their outer envelopes: H, or hemagglutinin, proteins and\nN, neuraminidase, proteins. CDC testing has confirmed that this third person carries a flu virus with an H5 protein,\nand the agency will do further sequencing to determine whether the N portion of the virus is N1, as is suspected.\nIt expects to have those results in the next few days.\nThe CDC confirmed Wednesday night that the person had an H5 influenza infection and forwarded the results to\nthe Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services announced last week that it was moving forward with a plan\nto repackage 4.8 million doses of a vaccine against H5N1 that is stored in bulk form in the Strategic National\nStockpile. The bulk supplies would be put into multidose vials so they could be distributed and administered more\neasily.\nOfficials said Thursday that before the vaccine would be given, it would need to go through certain regulatory\nsteps. They also said there's not currently a plan to offer or recommend the doses to any specific group of people.\nThe fill-and-finish process to repackage the vaccines will take at least a couple of months, officials said in the\nnews briefing.\nIn the meantime, Michigan's health department is advising people working on poultry or dairy farms to get a\nseasonal flu vaccine.\n\"It will not prevent infection with avian influenza viruses, but it can reduce the risk of coinfection with avian and flu\nviruses,\" the department said.",

But far less is\nbeing advocated to the workers who are in close contact and at high risk working in those milking parlors,\" said\nElizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers.\n\"$75 is not going to seem like a good gamble to someone who may be looking at much longer off of work. And\n$75 isn't going to feed their families,\" she said.\nStrater estimates that there are between 150,000 and 200,000 dairy workers in the US.\n\"This is not a huge amount of people. But if you think about how important to protecting the public health that\nwould be, you would think that we will be putting all of our resources into a protective ring around these folks,\" she\nsaid.\nStrater says there's a real reluctance on the part of farm workers to be tested, even when they have symptoms,\nbecause a positive test could mean time off work.\n\"The testing situation is really challenging,\" said Bethany Alcauter, director of research and public health\nprograms for the National Center for Farmworker Health.\nThe way we now find out about human cases of H5N1 is \"a very passive system,\" she said.\nAlcauter says public health officials assume that if someone has influenza symptoms, they'll go to a doctor, who\nwill take an occupational health history, and if the worker tests positive for the flu, the doctor will send that\nperson's swab to a state public health lab to be tested for H5N1. \"But that's not a very realistic scenario,\" she\nsaid, noting that only a few dozen people had been tested for the H5N1 virus after exposure to cattle.\nBesides payments to help assist farms in protecting their workers, payments of up to $1,500 per farm will be\navailable to aid in the development of biosecurity plans.

Finland stopped H5N1 in animals before it spread to humans\nlast summer. This story, along with a half-dozen other outbreaks that never made headlines, are featured in our\nnew Epidemics That Didn't Happen report.\nFinland did three things well:\nRapid response. Within 24 hours of the first cases being reported on a mink farm, Finland confirmed that the\nanimals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which was already known to be circulating\namong birds in Finland. Human and animal health officials worked together immediately to track infections,\nincluding testing at-risk people working on farms with infected animals.\nIn the United States, H5N1 has been spreading since at least late last year. Even today, the United States doesn't\nknow the extent of spread among animals or humans due to insufficient testing and tracking. The 7-1-7 target for\noutbreak detection and response should be our guiding principle: 7 days to detect a suspected infectious disease\noutbreak, 1 day to notify public health authorities to start an investigation and 7 days to complete the initial\nresponse. This approach can halt outbreaks before they spread. Finland's response met this target. The first 7 in\nthe US for H5N1 was more like 100 days. We have to improve the connection of human and animal health and\nstrengthen animal public health measures.\nTrust. Farmers already had high trust in the Finnish Food Authority after years of successful programs and had\nlaunched a surveillance program that resulted in rapid notification of unusual symptoms among their animals.\nFarmers were reimbursed for the value of animals that needed to be culled to stop disease spread, strengthening\ntrust in the government among the farming community. This trust will no doubt help Finland's next move:\nVaccinating frontline workers against H5N1. They are the first country to do so.\nTrust toward the United States government is low, especially among rural Americans who are at the front line of\nthese outbreaks. In May, in an effort to build trust with the farming community, the US Department of Agriculture\nannounced financial incentives to farms to help stem spread in dairy cattle, including covering veterinary\nexpenses for cattle testing positive for H5N1, compensating farms that supply personal protective equipment to\ntheir worker, and paying farm workers to participate in USDA and CDC studies. We may need to do more to\nprotect our nation's agricultural sector.\nCoordinated government response. Human health and agriculture officials in Finland coordinated closely, paving\nthe way for a rapid, effective response. Joint responses strengthened detection, worked with industry groups, and\nprotected workers from infection. Finland rapidly passed new legislation to ensure that its Food Authority had the\nmandate to implement effective control measures.\nIn the United States, government agencies have had rocky relationships given varying priorities, legal authorities,\nagility and politics. Coordination seems to be improving. Any directives from the government should be crafted to\nthe specific needs of each community; national mandates will likely not be practical given our country's size and\ndiversity.\nWe have a lot to learn and no time to lose. First, states and national authorities must work with one another. This\nwill require multiple federal agencies \ufffd including CDC, USDA, APHIS \ufffd and their state counterparts to share\ninformation transparently and in real time with each other and with the public. Second, Congress needs to provide\nresources to respond to the next pandemic and also for systems, workforce, and infrastructure so we are\nprepared to stop new and unknown events before they become epidemics. Third, and perhaps most importantly,\nwe must quickly build relationships with farm owners and workers by being responsive to their needs and\naddressing questions and concerns.\nIf one country responds to H5N1 well, that's not enough. Microbes know no borders. Every country \ufffd including the\nUnited States \ufffd needs to mount an effective response.

With three cases reported in people in the United States and clusters in cattle herds from\nMichigan to Texas, Idaho to North Carolina, it's clear that the virus is widespread among animals. To protect\npeople, animals, and our economy and to restore trust in public health, we need to get this right.\nWe've seen H5N1 coming for more than 20 years. Although the challenge was smaller because of it size, Finland\nstopped H5N1 in animals before it spread to humans last summer. This story, among a half dozen outbreaks that\nnever made headlines, is featured in our new Epidemics That Didn't Happen report.\nThe U.S. has done a lot, including scaling up test production, evaluating vaccines, tracking wastewater for related\nviruses, and providing information about efforts. Finland did three things particularly well; all are relevant to the\nU.S. response to the virus.\nRapid response. Within 24 hours of the first cases being reported on a mink farm, Finland confirmed that the\nanimals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which was known to be circulating among\nbirds in Finland, just at the virus has been circulating among birds in the U.S. for the past two years. Human and\nanimal health specialists worked together immediately to track infections, including testing at-risk workers on\nfarms with infected animals.\nIn the United States, H5N1 has been spreading among cattle since at least late last year. Even today, the United\nStates doesn't know the extent of spread among animals or humans due to insufficient testing and tracking. The\n7-1-7 target for outbreak detection and response should be our guiding principle: seven days to detect a\nsuspected infectious disease outbreak, one day to notify public health authorities, and seven days to complete the\ninitial response. This approach can halt outbreaks before they spread. Finland's response met this target. In the\nU.S., instead of 7 days, the time from emergence of H5N1 in cattle to detection was more like 100 days, and it's\nnot clear we've met the 7-day target for initial response even months into the outbreak. Doing so requires\ncommunication and public health measures in the affected communities and an effective coordination\nmechanism. We must improve the connection of human and animal health and strengthen animal public health.\nTrust. Farmers already had a high level of trust in the Finnish Food Authority after years of successful programs,\nand had launched a surveillance program that resulted in rapid notification of unusual symptoms among their\nanimals. Farmers were immediately reimbursed for the value of animals that needed to be culled to stop disease\nspread, strengthening trust of the government in the farming community. This trust will no doubt help Finland's\nnext move: vaccinating frontline workers against H5N1. They are the first country to do so.\nTrust toward the United States government is low, especially among rural Americans who are on the front line of\nthese outbreaks. In May, the US Department of Agriculture announced payments to farms to help stem spread in\ndairy cattle, including covering veterinary expenses for cattle testing positive for H5N1, compensating farms that\nsupply personal protective equipment to their workers, and paying farm workers to participate in USDA and CDC\nstudies. We may need to do more to protect our nation's agricultural sector.\nCoordinated government response. Human health and agriculture officials in Finland coordinated closely, paving\nthe way for a rapid, effective response. The joint response strengthened detection, collaboration of industry\ngroups, and protection of workers from infection. Finland rapidly passed new legislation to ensure it had the\nauthority to implement effective control measures.\nIn the United States, government agencies have had rocky relationships given varying priorities, legal authorities,\nagility and politics. There are multiple agencies involved: USDA monitors cattle health, US Food and Drug\nAdministration monitors milk safety and the CDC monitors diseases in humans, including from animal exposure.\nCoordination seems to be improving, but any directives from the government should be crafted to the specific\nneeds of each community; national mandates will likely not be practical given our country's size and diversity.\nWe have a lot to learn, and no time to lose. First, localities, states and national authorities must work with one\nanother. This will require multiple federal agencies \ufffd including CDC, USDA, FDA \ufffd and their state counterparts to\nshare information transparently and in real time with each other and with the public. Second, Congress needs to\nprovide resources to prevent and respond to pandemic risks, including for systems, workforce, and infrastructure\nso we're prepared to stop new events before they become epidemics. Third and perhaps most importantly, we\nmust quickly build relationships with farm owners and workers by being responsive to their needs and addressing\ntheir questions and concerns.\nIf one country responds to H5N1 well, that's not enough. Microbes know no borders. Every country \ufffd including the\nUnited States \ufffd needs an effective response. My organization's latest Epidemics That Didn't Happen report\nhighlights how countries with responsive health systems prevent outbreaks from becoming epidemics through\ncareful planning, early detection, and swift action.\nAnalysis by Dr. Tom Frieden",

        "fulltext": "(CNN) \ufffd A US farmworker who caught bird flu after working with dairy cattle in Texas appears to be the first\nknown case of mammal-to-human transmission of the virus, a new study shows.\nThe dairy worker sought care in late March after developing painful red, swollen, weeping eyes with burst blood\nvessels. He had no fever, however, and his lungs were clear, according to a new letter about the case published\nin the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday.\nHe reported no contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but he did have repeated, direct, close contact\nwith dairy cows in the same part of the state with other infected herds.\nEven though the man didn't become seriously ill, his case is important because it confirms that humans can be\ninfected with H5N1 after contact with cows. At the same time, it also leaves critical questions unanswered and\nillustrates how hard it will be to track the infection in this vulnerable population of workers, where testing positive\nfor an infectious disease might mean losing days of work and pay.\n\"For farmworkers specifically, certainly these are folks that are that are living in a state of economic desperation,\nand what they're not going to do, is they're not going to test for something if they don't have paid sick leave,\nbecause they cannot afford to be sent home and told to stay home and not work,\" said Elizabeth Strater, who is\ndirector of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers.\nStrater says UFW, like other groups, has heard rumors that there are dairy workers who are sick, but don't want\nto be tested, but she said it's nothing that they're able to confirm.\nHealth officials in Texas said that they did test other sick dairy workers, including some with red eyes, but they\nturned out to have other illnesses, not bird flu.\n\"The people tested volunteered to be tested,\" said Lara Anton, senior press officer with the Texas Department of\nState Health Services.\n\"It's likely there were other people with symptoms who did not want to be tested so we cannot say with absolute\ncertainty that no one else contracted H5N1. We can say for sure some of the people on dairy farms tested\npositive for other respiratory viruses that are commonly circulating in the human population,\" Anton said.\nIn the case of the man who did test positive for bird flu, he and his and his close family members were given\nantiviral medications and they recovered without any lasting problems, the letter says.\nSwabs of the patient's eyes and lungs revealed something interesting, too. While his eyes were teeming with the\nH5N1 virus, there was hardly any virus in his lungs. That could mean the worker was infected through his\neyes\ufffdeither rubbing them with contaminated hands, or through splashes of contaminated milk\ufffdrather than\nthrough his lungs, and the virus never migrated there, or that the virus couldn't get a foothold in his lungs because\nit was adapted primarily to infect birds, but not cells in the human airway.\nThe letter on the case was written by researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along\nwith doctors at the Texas Department of State Health Services and researchers at the Texas Tech Bioterrorism\nResponse Laboratory.\nHealth officials said they couldn't do further investigation of how the man was infected because \"epidemiological\ninvestigations were not able to be conducted at the farm\" where he worked. They were also unable to test other\nworkers at the same farm.\nThat kind of testing is critical to answer questions about how the worker became infected, whether others were\nbeing infected and if so, for how long they were infected, what kind of symptoms they had, if they had any at all.\nThe CDC is currently looking for farms that will allow them to conduct such a detailed study.\n\"Understanding the current avian flu outbreak among dairy cattle is a vital priority to help protect human health,\"\nthe CDC said in a statement to CNN. \"Discussions are under way with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate\nin CDC-led epidemiological studies. In the meantime, states continue to test symptomatic farm workers and\nmonitor those who have been exposed to infected animals. CDC also continues to closely monitor a robust,\nnationwide flu surveillance system. To date, it has not detected any unusual flu activity.\"",
