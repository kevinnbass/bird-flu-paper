Nearly 2 billion animals a year are now trucked and shipped around the world on journeys that can take weeks. We'll be exploring why this trade continues, the risk it poses to disease spread and why the EU has become such a key player. We started the series reporting on hundreds of thousands of unwanted male dairy calves due to be born in Ireland this year, where the choice may be between live export or disposing on-farm. We've also reported on the huge revenues generated by the industry, with the Middle East a key market. In 1988, the global trade in all live animals was worth $716m (£48m); by 2017 that had risen to $21bn. In 2016, Saudi Arabia alone imported almost $1bn worth of live animals, mostly sheep. If you have some expertise in this field and would like to contribute to our investigation, please get in touch via animalsfarmed@theguardian.com. News from around the world More than 800 million animals are estimated to have been killed in Australian bushfires, which have burned 10 million hectares (40,000 square miles) of land in the country. The Australian government expects that 100,000 cattle and sheep could be lost as a result of the bushfires. At least 13,120 farm animals have been euthanised or confirmed dead as a result of bushfires in New South Wales. An outbreak of the highly contagious H5N8 bird flu has been rapidly spreading across eastern Europe this month. Outbreaks have been reported in the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. French authorities culled millions of birds in an attempt to contain the last outbreak of the H5N8 virus in Europe in 2017. In China, an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N6 bird flu has been reported in swans in the western Xinjiang region of the country. A reported 180 sheep rescued from the Queen Hind cargo ship that capsized as they were being transported from Romania to Saudi Arabia are due to be resettled. More than 14,000 sheep onboard the ship died. Animal welfare groups leading the rescue of the sheep opposed sending the surviving animals on to Saudi Arabia for slaughter and are in discussions to gain custody of the sheep and resettle them in animal sanctuaries in Romania. One of Europe's largest meat producers, the Netherlands-based Vion, has said it expects the numbers of pigs and cattle in western Europe to decline by 20% over the next decade. It also expects meat consumption to fall by 1½% a year over the same period. Dutch food safety inspectors still allegedly encounter pigs drowning in hot water having not been properly killed, according to documents obtained by an animal rights group. Campaigners have called for independent camera surveillance on slaughter lines in the Netherlands. In England, all abattoirs are required to have CCTV installed. A farming minister in the German state of Lower Saxony has called for a meat tax to be introduced in the country. Meat in Germany is currently taxed at a reduced rate of 7% instead of 19%. Former environment minister Michael Gove has previously rejected the idea of introducing a meat tax in the UK.

{"id": "4", "title": "Opinion: Bird flu. SARS. China coronavirus. Is history repeating itself?", "date": "2020-01-27", "fulltext": "HONG KONG Sometimes history seems to unspool in a continuous playback loop. That is the feeling I get from watching Hongkongers donning face masks, dousing hands with sanitizer, and once again bracing for the possibility that a deadly new coronavirus outbreak originating in mainland China will spread here. Chinese authorities' delayed response, the secrecy breeding mistrust, the lack of full transparency, and efforts to control the narrative by downplaying the seriousness it all rings sadly familiar. Public health emergencies should be handled quickly, transparently, and devoid of political considerations. But public health is inherently political and, with anything involving China, politics can never be fully excised. For Chinese Communist officials, particularly at the provincial level, there is an innate tendency to cover up and conceal, their long-imbued penchant for secrecy always taking precedence over trifling concerns like promoting public awareness and advocating proper precautions. That was certainly the case in late 1997, just after China assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong, when the territory was hit by an outbreak of the H5N1 virus known as 'bird flu.' Well into the outbreak, with people sick and some dying, Hong Kong officials were reluctant to finger China as the source, even though 80% of the territory's poultry came from the mainland. Hong Kong ordered the slaughter of more than 1.3 million chickens, ducks, pigeons, and other birds, but officials were still nonsensically hesitant to point to China as the culprit behind the contagion out of fear of contradicting Beijing, which insisted strongly that all its chickens were healthy. Support STAT: STAT is offering coverage of the coronavirus for free. Please consider a subscription to support our journalism. Start free trial today. The same obfuscation and denial came from China's Communist authorities in reaction to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, also caused by a coronavirus, in late 2002 and 2003. Even as the virus spread, Chinese officials continued to undercount cases and delay reporting information to the World Health Organization. The government did not warn the public for months, allowing people carrying the virus to migrate freely, and did not alert the WHO until February 2003. China finally began concerted action in the summer of 2003 and SARS was quickly brought under control. But the inadequate reporting and delayed response led to a public health trust deficit that persists today. Like bird flu in 1997 and the SARS epidemic of 2002 to 2003, the newest coronavirus has originated in the mainland, this time in Wuhan, most likely in a market where exotic wild animals are sold. Like before, there are suspicions that in these early stages the number of confirmed cases were undercounted, underreported, or both. Like before, there were delays and denials, with Wuhan officials initially downplaying the virus as mild, treatable, and contained while dismissing the likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Those who disagreed online were questioned by police for spreading 'false rumors.' But 2020 is not 1997, nor even 2003. China's public health infrastructure and reporting system have become more reliable. Most importantly, internet use and penetration in China today makes it virtually impossible for a cover-up to last for long. Despite censorship of some news about the coronavirus including blocking foreign media websites social media platforms have been filled with debate, discussion, and questions from citizens asking what precautions they should take. State media has also made much of President Xi Jinping's instruction to local officials to open up about the number of cases and the severity of the epidemic or risk consequences. And WHO investigators and Hong Kong specialists have been allowed to visit Wuhan. Does this signal that Beijing is opting for a new policy of transparency this time? 'It's still very mixed,' said my colleague, King-wa Fu, who studies Chinese censorship patterns at the University of Hong Kong. 'We see censorship. But we also see a lot of discussion online. We'll have to wait and see.' The rapid spiral in the number of identified cases of infection with the coronavirus, and the new draconian measures taken, like effectively quarantining Wuhan at the start of the busy Lunar New Year travel period, breeds suspicion that the real picture may be far worse than officials even now admit. Even the quarantine smacks of too little, too late. It seems ill-planned, and likely to be largely ineffective. First there is the near impracticality of sealing off a city of 11 million people, larger than the populations of Hong Kong or New York City. The move was taken the day before the New Year's Eve travel period, when many people would have already started on their journeys. Planes, trains, and buses were halted, but it was unclear what provisions would be made for private cars. Perhaps most inexplicably, the ban was announced to take effect at 10 a.m. on a Thursday, creating an early-morning crush of travelers trying to get out ahead of the quarantine. Then there's the matter of whether such a closure of Wuhan could even be effective. Some public health experts I spoke with said there seems to have been no provision made for getting food, fuel, and critical supplies like medicine into the city, or how investigators, decision-makers, or even journalists would enter and whether they would then be permitted to leave. And while the closure might temporarily tamp down the geographical spread of the coronavirus apart from those residents who have already left it could also have the unintended effect of turning Wuhan into an incubator of infection. The Hong Kong government was already facing a loss of public confidence after months of protests sparked by Chief Executive Carrie Lam's botched extradition bill. Some pro-democracy lawmakers and ordinary citizens are accusing the government of dragging its feet on the virus crisis for fear of offending Beijing for example, not shutting down the West Kowloon rail terminus, and not immediately demanding arriving mainland train passengers fill out health declaration forms. Bird flu redux. For the Chinese Communist Party, which just celebrated 70 years in power, its legitimacy derives not from any election but from its performance. China's leaders base their right to rule on how effectively they have managed what is soon to be the world's largest economy. One may have thought China's leaders had learned from their errors handling SARS. Unfortunately, history teaches us otherwise, and seems to be repeating itself again. Keith B.

{"id": "5", "title": "Avian Influenza in China Adds to Economic Concerns Amid Coronavirus Spread; China pledges more support for its economy, exempts from punitive tariffs products", "date": "2020-02-01", "fulltext": "HONG KONG—Chinese authorities announced Saturday a recurrence of avian influenza in chickens in central China, adding fresh economic concerns for a country reeling from an outbreak of coronavirus that has sickened nearly 12,000 people since it emerged in December. In a sign of the pressure already on China, Australia and Vietnam joined the U.S. and others in distancing their citizens from the country over the coronavirus, while Apple Inc. shut its stores on the Chinese mainland and Beijing pledged more support for embattled businesses. The Latest on the Coronavirus * Australia orders its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days * Vietnam halts all flights to and from Taiwan and China * Apple closes all of its retail stores in mainland China until Feb. 9 * Beijing pledges more support for its economy * Avian influenza adds to concerns about economy The avian influenza is likely to add to the economic damage rather than pose a major immediate health risk. China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that a case of H5N1 avian influenza, last identified in China in April last year, had killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. But while avian influenza can be fatal in humans, with a mortality rate of 60%, according to the World Health Organization, it doesn't spread easily to humans. In addition to the coronavirus, China has been grappling with an outbreak of African swine fever that has decimated the country's pig population over the past two years. Pork is China's main source of protein, and swine fever last year pushed overall consumer inflation to the highest level in eight years. Hunan province, where the avian influenza outbreak announced on Saturday took place, neighbors Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Australia said that it would impose new entry restrictions in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, banning foreign nationals who have been in mainland China in the past 14 days from entering Australia, while Qantas Airways Ltd., the country's national carrier, said it would suspend flights to the mainland starting Feb. 9. Vietnam's civil aviation authority said it would halt all flights to and from Taiwan and China, including the special Chinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong, starting Saturday. Several countries and airlines have suspended flights to China, including Pakistan, Italy and the U.S.'s American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. The move by Australia, which also ordered its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days, to tighten entry restrictions followed a U.S. tightening. A day earlier, the U.S. said it would deny entry to foreign nationals who had traveled anywhere in China within the past 14 days and imposed quarantines on Americans returning from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. The coronavirus has killed 259 people and infected nearly 12,000 in China as of late Friday, according to the official National Health Commission in Beijing. The number of infected patients in China alone now exceeds the global total for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed nearly 800 people after emerging from southern China in 2002 and 2003. Authorities in Beijing pledged more support for the economy in a bid to reassure investors before markets reopen on Monday. Companies and industries in regions hit particularly hard by the outbreak, including those that provide medical supplies, could get reduced lending rates, the central bank said in a joint statement with other government agencies, including the Finance Ministry and the banking regulator. China's cabinet said separately that products imported from the U.S. to control the outbreak will be exempt from punitive tariffs through March 31. Authorities also exempted tariffs and other taxes on products donated by overseas entities, according to a joint statement by the Finance Ministry and the customs agency. Resources are strained in Hubei province, and medical staff have been forced to turn away patients because of a lack of beds and basic medical supplies. Local authorities in Huanggang, a city about 35 miles east of Wuhan, imposed new restrictions on residents' movements, saying only one person per household in the city center would be allowed to go out every two days to purchase basic necessities. Apple is closing all of its retail stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb. 9 'out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts,' it said. The company operates more than 40 stores in China. North Korea said through its state media that it would send an aid fund to Chinese authorities, a rare extension of aid from Pyongyang. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, 'expressed deep consolation for the families who lost their blood relatives due to the infectious disease,' according to a report in Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency. North Korea—a close ally of China that has long been dependent on China's largess—was among the first countries to adopt stringent measures to keep the coronavirus outside its borders, and vowed to redouble its efforts. 'The novel coronavirus throws the world into uneasiness and horror, but the advantages and might of our state system—will be fully demonstrated to the whole world once again, when we ensure that the virus does not reach our country and that no one suffers from the infections,' it read.

{"id": "6", "title": "Industry scrambles to stop fatal bird flu in South Carolina", "date": "2020-04-10", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — An infectious and fatal strain of bird flu has been confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in South Carolina, the first case of the more serious strain of the disease in the United States since 2017 and a worrisome development for an industry that was devastated by previous outbreaks. The high pathogenic case was found at an operation in Chesterfield County, South Carolina, marking the first case of the more dangerous strain since one found in a Tennessee chicken flock in 2017. In 2015, an estimated 50 million poultry had to be killed at operations mainly in the Upper Midwest after infections spread throughout the region. “Yes, it’s concerning when we see cases, but we are prepared to respond very quickly and that was done in this case,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The USDA has been working in recent months with scientists and farmers in North Carolina and South Carolina, where a low pathogenic — or less severe — strain of bird flu had been detected. Low pathogenic bird flu causes few clinical signs in infected birds. However, two strains of low pathogenic bird flu — the H5 and H7 strains — can mutate into highly pathogenic forms, which are frequently fatal to birds and easily transmissible between susceptible species. Low pathogenic cases were already in an area near the South Carolina and North Carolina state line and USDA was closely monitoring and testing. The case in Chesterfield County, South Carolina was expected to be another low pathogenic case, but it came back from the laboratory high pathogenic which means the less severe virus mutated into the more severe version, Cole said. “Our scientists at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory had looked at the virus characteristics of the low path virus and they had previously indicated that this was one that was probably likely to mutate so they were watching it very closely,” Cole said. A laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the virus that had been killing turkeys was a high pathogenic H7N3 strain of avian influenza. A report on the outbreak indicates it was discovered on April 6. It has killed 1,583 turkeys and the remainder of the 32,577 birds in the flock were euthanized. State officials quarantined the farm, movement controls were implemented and enhanced surveillance was already in place in the area. “The flock was quickly depopulated and will not enter the marketplace,” said Joel Brandenberger, president of the National Turkey Federation, an industry trade group. “Thorough disinfecting and cleaning procedures have already been initiated on premises as well as surveillance of commercial flocks in the surrounding area. This occurrence poses no threat to public health. Turkey products remain safe and nutritious.” He said poultry farmers implement strict biosecurity measures year-round and routinely test flocks for avian influenza. These measures were implemented after an H5N2 avian influenza outbreak that began in December 2014 swept commercial chicken, egg laying and turkey populations throughout much of 2015 killing 50 million birds and causing as much as $3 billion in economic damage. That outbreak is believed to have originated in wild birds. Nearly 90 percent of the bird losses were on egg-laying chicken farms in Iowa and turkey farms in Minnesota. The bulk of other cases occurred in the adjacent states of Nebraska, Wisconsin, and South Dakota. Cole said since 2015 significant planning, exercises and coordination has occurred between the federal government, state agencies and the industry. Cole said the coronavirus pandemic has not affected the ability of the government to respond to the bird flu. A highly pathogenic H7N9 bird flu strain was detected in Lincoln County, Tennessee, in a chicken flock of 73,500 birds in early March 2017. Ten days later samples from a commercial flock less than two miles away also tested positive for the same strain. The birds were euthanized and buried and the virus didn’t spread further indicating immediate mitigation action can stop spread.", "media_outlet": "AP", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "7", "title": "Avian Flu Fast Facts", "date": "2024-06-05", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Here's a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds. There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called 'Influenza A (H5N1),' or the 'H5N1 virus.' Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu. The mortality rate is close to 60% for infected humans. Timeline Early 1900s -The avian flu is first identified in Italy. 1961 - The H5N1 strain is isolated in birds in South Africa.

{"id": "8", "title": "You got it': how bird flu turned one US farmer's life upside down", "date": "2020-09-17", "fulltext": "Greg Langmo's decades-old business was among those hit when a lethal strain decimated poultry barns across America. In April 2015, Greg Langmo's five turkey farms teemed with toms, hens and chicks. His family's decades-old business in Meeker county, Minnesota, was thriving, and the hundreds of thousands of birds he bred and sold each year were healthy. And then, late one evening, Langmo's phone rang. Birds in one of his barns, usually active, were sitting, unable to make the short walk to their feeders and waterers. The following morning, he found hundreds of limp, white-feathered bodies. Langmo sent some dead toms to the University of Minnesota's veterinary diagnostic laboratory. That night, the farmer lay sleepless. Again, his phone rang. It was a vet from the lab: 'You got it.' Langmo's farms had been hit by the Eurasian/North American H5N2 strain of lethal avian influenza, which, along with another lethal strain, Eurasian H5N8, rampaged across poultry farms in the American west and midwest between December 2014 and June 2015. A third strain, Eurasian/North American H5N1, was detected in nearly 100 wild birds by US wildlife biologists. It was the first time a foreign strain of bird flu H5N8 had entered North America and mixed with mild bird flu viruses. It's one of many lethal bird flu outbreaks to kill billions of birds and cost billions of dollars over the past hundred years. Such losses are part of the reality of farming today. Lethal avian influenza's advent is strongly linked to the development of modern agriculture, which created a global network of disease incubators—industrial farms in some parts of the world, live animal markets in others—linked by trading routes, movement of labourers and equipment, and migration of wild birds. Critical diagnosis Soon after the diagnosis, says Langmo, 'the rest of the birds began dying by the bushel.' To stop the spread, Langmo and his employees killed survivors with a swift crack to the back of the head. Within three days, virtually all 11,000 toms in the infected barn were dead. Then they moved into the other barns. Workers from the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) arrived and doused any live birds with water-based foam, an asphyxiant used to mass-euthanise poultry in emergencies only. Foam flowed across the floors, bubbling like a choppy sea, the turkeys beneath it gasping for air. Fifteen minutes later, all were dead. Only other poultry farmers will know the helpless feeling of losing a great flock of birds, Greg Langmo reflected. He lost 225,000 turkeys across five farms. Langmo was one of 211 American commercial poultry farmers who battled bird flu during the 2014-15 outbreak, the worst the $40bn (£1bn) US poultry industry has experienced. Twenty-one flocks on backyard farms were diagnosed and destroyed. Nationwide, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys died from the virus or were killed to control it. American commercial poultry farmers lost about $1.6bn. The US poultry industry lost an estimated $3.3bn. 'This outbreak was arguably the most significant animal health event in US history,' says Dr Julie Gauthier, assistant director for poultry health at USDA-APHIS. Deadly history Lethal bird flu, originally 'fowl plague,' was first diagnosed on Italian farms in 1878. While poultry die-offs reported before 1878 may have been bird flu, this was the first time scientists distinguished the virus from bacterial poultry diseases, such as fowl cholera. Subsequent research revealed that bird flu is an influenza-A virus. These viruses are rarely lethal and often mildly afflict their natural hosts. But lethal influenza-A viruses, which mutate in and emerge from the bodies of domesticated animals, are known to infect and kill not just poultry, but birds, horses, swine, bats, dogs and even humans. The emergence and coexistence of three hybrid lethal bird flu strains—H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8—in the US during the 2014-2015 pandemic underscores the ability of influenza-A viruses to rapidly mix, transform, infect and persist. Lethal bird flu viruses have emerged more frequently as poultry farms have expanded capacities and quickened animal-rearing rates over the past 50 years. In the 37 years from 1959 to 1995, these viruses emerged 14 times globally, about one outbreak every 2.6 years; while in the 13 years from 1996 to 2008, they arose 11 times, about one outbreak every 1.2 years. These species don't mix Scientists and farmers are divided over the best way forward. In terms of prevention, should birds be kept inside, which would reduce potential contact with wild birds? Should large-scale movement of animals (industrial farming depends on the transportation of large populations of birds after breeding and for slaughter) be scaled down? That is one of the key vectors by which the disease may be spread. Some regions of the world look to good farm hygiene and high levels of biosecurity, where infected birds are confined and killed to eradicate disease; others, particularly in countries with many outdoor industrial farms, struggle with implementing biosecurity and may lack available veterinary care, so they allow diseases to circulate, using vaccines to reduce illness and mortality. 'Vaccines do not prevent birds from becoming infected with the avian influenza virus or from producing and shedding the virus into the environment,' says Gauthier, adding that up until now culling birds was the preferred solution in the US. Constant threat Gene Baur, president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary, a UK-based animal protection organisation, believes that establishing a network of small farms serving local communities is one powerful possibility, because it reduces the need for transporting animals, farm labourers and equipment. Scientists are recognising the benefits of giving birds more space—research shows chickens stressed by overcrowded living conditions typical to commercial farms have diminished immunity to disease. After a major avian influenza outbreak in Thailand from 2004 to 2005, experts determined that industrial farms were more likely to be infected than backyard farms. In the Netherlands, after a 2003 outbreak, scientists suggested that thinning commercial flocks could prevent the next epidemic. When you confine animals in these filthy conditions they become breeding grounds for disease, Gene Baur, Farm Sanctuary, says. 'When you confine animals in these filthy, crowded, stressful conditions, just like humans, they become breeding grounds for disease,' says Baur. After considering his financial losses from the 2014-2015 pandemic, Langmo spent a year rebuilding his business, downsizing from five farms to two. He says he's boosted biosecurity by cutting cross-traffic, checking birds' health more frequently and improving sanitation with routine deep-cleanings. 'After a thorough sanitisation, each barn literally needs to be as clean as your kitchen, no feathers, no nothing,' says Langmo. 'It's very expensive.'

{"id": "11", "title": "UK bird flu outbreaks prompt tough new restrictions on farms", "date": "2020-11-12", "fulltext": "Farmers found to be breaching new biosecurity rules face unlimited fines or three month prison sentence Poultry keepers across England, Scotland and Wales are facing tough new lockdown-style measures on their farms to control the spread of bird flu. It follows outbreaks of a highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of bird flu in Cheshire, Devon, Gloucestershire and Hertfordshire over the past two weeks. The outbreaks have been found in wild bird populations and two broiler chicken farms, where all the birds are being culled. Farmers are required to restrict access for non-essential people, remove sources of wild bird food and ensure workers are regularly disinfecting footwear and changing clothes. Those found to not be complying face up to three months in prison or unlimited fines, according to the measures announced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). UK and European farmers have been on alert after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. When bird flu was detected in the same area of Russia in the summers of 2005 and 2016, epidemics followed in northern and eastern Europe. However, the speed of the spread of outbreaks in Europe over the past few weeks has caught the industry by surprise, with hundreds of thousands of birds culled after multiple outbreaks across Germany and the Netherlands. Thousands of dead wild birds were also reportedly found on the north-west coast of Germany last week, most likely infected with bird flu. British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said bird flu was a significant threat to the commercial poultry industry and he supported new restrictive measures to minimise the risk of a larger and wider outbreak. It is an incredibly difficult situation for farmers and producers if they get a case of avian influenza (AI), so the controls and their costs are made to be as fair as they can be. For instance, farmers are compensated for the culling of healthy birds as part of AI controls. The system is as fair as it possibly can be, given the nature of the situation. During the last significant bird flu outbreak in 2016/17, there was also a ban on keeping poultry outdoors. Defra said this was not being considered at present, but would be if the outbreak spread further. Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and that properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. PHE said: Our advice regarding contact with wild birds remains the same make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after coming into contact with any animal and do not touch any sick or dead birds.

{"id": "12", "title": "Bird flu fears grow after spate of mysterious UK swan deaths", "date": "2020-11-27", "fulltext": "Virus causing high levels of mortality in birds, with risk to chickens and other poultry A spate of baffling swan deaths is strongly suspected to be caused by a virulent new strain of avian flu sweeping across Britain. Dying swans were found spinning in circles and discharging blood from their nostrils on Ulverston canal, Cumbria. Swan rescuers have taken in more than 25 dying birds in Worcestershire and nine swans were found dead in Stanley Park, Blackpool. Postmortem examinations have confirmed that six black swans and cygnets that died in Dawlish, Devon, had contracted the latest strain of bird flu, H5N8. Brought in by wild birds migrating across Europe, the strain last caused widespread avian deaths in the winter of 2016-17. The risk to human health from the virus is very low, according to Public Health England. Fears are growing that the virus will wipe out chickens and other poultry this winter, with outbreaks already confirmed among captive birds in Kent, Cheshire, Leicestershire, and chickens at a broiler breeding farm in Herefordshire. The government has declared an avian influenza prevention zone across England, Scotland and Wales, requiring all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures. While the virus is particularly visible in swans and large wildfowl, other wild bird deaths confirmed this month include pink-footed geese, greylag geese, Canada geese, buzzards and curlews. Dr Ruth Cromie, a research fellow at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, said: 'Wild birds are often seen as evil vectors, but they are victims of a virus which originally spread from poultry. Wild birds get used as scapegoats for poor biosecurity and people moving chickens around the globe.' She said avian flu, like all influenza viruses, regularly mutates, and there are either genetic or environmental factors making it particularly pathogenic this year. The virus disrupts the nervous system and can cause neurological symptoms in birds, such as head-twitching, stumbling and swimming in circles. Cromie added: 'We can be sure it is causing high levels of mortality this year.' Caroline Sim, of Flying Free, a volunteer operation to protect and rescue swans in Ulverston, said she had never seen such strange symptoms in the family of 10 swans there that died of bird flu. 'Many of them started to spin on their axis in one direction. It was terrible to see. Some of them were discharging from their nostrils and some of it was bloody,' she said. The dead birds were collected by officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to be tested. David Cash, of Worcester Swan Rescue, said about 25 swans had died. 'The swans were looking lethargic and not wanting food, and doing a lot of coughing – similar to the symptoms of Covid.' The government's prevention zone obliges all bird keepers to take measures to discourage mixing between captive and wild birds, such as feeding and watering their birds in enclosed areas, and removing wild bird food sources from around captive birds. Experts noticed an unusually high level of avian flu in Russia during the summer, and this has been spread across Europe by wild species, such as swans and geese, during their westward migration for the winter. Christine Middlemiss, the UK chief veterinary officer, repeated the Food Standards Agency advice that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for consumers. She added: 'Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to meet enhanced biosecurity requirements and this is in your interests to do, to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.' Cromie said that while improving biosecurity was the best short-term solution, the authorities should be looking at how these viruses originate in and are amplified by industrial meat production. Britain slaughters more than 1 billion chickens every year. She said: 'We should not be looking to put every chicken in a house, but asking: do we really need to have that many chickens? We're creating these nutty industrialised production systems that create a variety of health problems.'", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

Millions of free-range hens and other birds will have to be kept indoors from 14 December, in a national government crackdown to try to limit the spread of a virulent strain of avian flu across Great Britain. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a statement that the chief vets of England, Scotland and Wales had agreed the new legal requirement for all birdkeepers to bring their flocks indoors, to keep them separate from potentially infectious wild birds. The strict new lockdown-style measures, which have already been introduced in the Netherlands, apply not only to large commercial poultry farms but also smaller keepers with hens in coops or garden pens. Keepers are being urged to use the next 11 days to prepare for the new measures, including taking steps to safeguard animal welfare, consult their vet and where necessary erect additional housing or self-contained netted areas. Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as free-range for 16 weeks after the birds have been brought indoors, but if the restrictions last beyond that they must be downgraded to barn produced using stickers on packaging. Similarly, poultry meat can be labelled free-range for 12 weeks. To be defined as free range in the UK, a chicken must normally be at least 56 days old before slaughter and have had access to outside space for at least half that time. Premium free-range eggs currently represent 56% of UK retail egg sales – the highest proportion of any European country – whereas just 2% of eggs are from the barn system. Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser with the National Farmers' Union, urged all farmers to comply with the new rules. Due to a number of confirmed avian influenza cases, the introduction of these new housing measures is a logical next step to best protect poultry. These new measures mean that every poultry keeper, whether you have one hen in the garden or a large poultry business, must house their birds indoors and I would urge everyone with poultry to take these measures seriously. It's crucial that everyone remains vigilant and reports any signs of disease in their birds at the earliest opportunity. On Sunday, all 10,500 turkeys at a farm in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, were culled after an outbreak was spotted on Saturday, while a 3km (2-mile) and 10km temporary control zone was put in place to stop the disease spreading. About 13,500 birds were culled earlier this month following confirmation of an avian flu outbreak at a commercial farm in Helsby, near Frodsham in Cheshire. Defra reiterated that the risk to human health and food safety from the virus was very low. UK and European farmers have been on alert after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. In a joint statement, Great Britain's three chief vets said: We have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease and are now planning to introduce a legal requirement for bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds. We have not taken this decision lightly, but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease. A spokesman for the British Egg Industry Council said: To date there have been no cases of avian flu in free-range laying flocks; however it is vital that we continue to protect the health and welfare of the UK's laying flock and commercial poultry operations. The requirement to keep birds inside from 14 December is a further step to those already taken to continue to protect flocks. It is the first time in four years that a so-called housing order has been imposed on the UK poultry sector due to a significant outbreak of bird flu, when measures were put in place from December 2016 to May 2017.

It applies not only to large commercial poultry farms but also smaller farmers with hens in coops or garden pens. Lockdown and the shift towards 'self-sufficiency' has triggered a huge surge in interest by individuals in keeping birds and there is concern that many may have scant regard or understanding of the importance of biosecurity measures. The restrictions will apply to chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants. No end date for the measures has yet been given, and Defra said they would be kept under 'regular review.' Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as 'free-range' for 16 weeks from today, but if restrictions last longer they must be downgraded to 'barn produced' using stickers on packaging.

Among commercial producers preparing for the new restrictions is Alastaire Brice, who runs Havensfield Happy Hens—currently with 160,000 laying hens in 22 flocks across farms in Norfolk and Suffolk. The current lockdown comes as no surprise, Brice told the East Anglian Daily Times: 'It's expected, bearing in mind the sporadic cases that have been going on up and down the country. Last year, they had a reprieve when bird flu didn't arrive in the country but this year it started with a bang.' It can take longer to get older flocks to adjust to coming indoors, he explained, with hens vulnerable to anxiety or aggression. Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said: 'While contingency plans are in place and the spread of bird flu is being effectively monitored, the combination of avian influenza, the coronavirus pandemic, and a tight, non-negotiable Brexit deadline, has proven yet again the vulnerability of Britain's food security.'", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

He said the infected birds were culled and authorities have carried out medical examinations of people who were in contact with them. The virus, which is mainly spread through contact with infected animals, can cause severe illness or death in humans. Egypt suffered a major outbreak of bird flu in 2006 that led to the suspension of all poultry exports. Authorities have been pressing to renew them, and earlier this year, the World Organization for Animal Health, an intergovernmental body, had declared Egypt free of bird flu for the first time in 14 years. The H5N1 strain of bird flu spread in early 2000s in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, leading to the slaughter of tens of millions of chickens and ducks. Hundreds of people were infected, many of whom died, according to the World Health Organization. Egypt is at high risk because many of its poultry farms are in residential areas. Many Egyptians also raise pigeons and chickens at home to supplement their income. Even in dense urban areas, birds are kept on rooftops, balconies and courtyards.

The country's Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying issued an alert on Wednesday, urging states to take measures to avoid any further spread of the disease. The southern state of Kerala ordered the culling of more than 38,000 poultry birds on Tuesday after reports of dead birds infected with the disease emerged in two districts, according to the state's Minister for Animal Husbandry, K. Raju. \"Nineteen rapid response teams have been formed for this,\" Raju said. About 17,000 birds have been culled in Kerala so far, and eggs have also been destroyed in some districts. The northern state of Himachal Pradesh reported the death of more than 3,000 birds from the disease, mostly bar-headed geese at a wildlife sanctuary, according to Archana Sharma, a senior official in the state forest department. \"The birds affected are migratory birds. All we can do is follow the strategy of clearing up the area of contamination. We comb the entire area of the sanctuary and we physically send 10 teams every day who search for any dead birds and dispose of them,\" Sharma said. The alert comes as India continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 10.3 million people in the country, and is about to embark on one of the most ambitious mass vaccination programs ever undertaken. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually only affects birds. There are many different strains, but the most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called Influenza A (H5N1), or the H5N1 virus. In India, the disease spreads mostly through migratory birds entering the country during the winter season. Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. There have been no reports of avian flu transmitting to people in India so far during this outbreak. \"There is no need to panic,\" Minister of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Giriraj Singh, told public service broadcaster Doordarshan on Wednesday. \"We also provide compensation to farmers for the birds that have to be culled.\" Other countries in Asia have also experienced outbreaks of bird flu this winter.

New clusters are constantly emerging,\" the head of France's CIFOQ federation of foie gras producers, Marie-Pierre Pe, told Agence France-Presse. The number of outbreaks in France had now risen to 124, the ministry of agriculture said on Thursday, adding that about 350,000 ducks had been slaughtered since 24 December. Earlier this week the government's chief veterinary officer, Loic Evain, said more than 200,000 ducks had already been slaughtered and that a further 400,000 birds were set to be culled, out of about 35 million reared each year. He described the virus, which is not harmful to humans, as \"very, very contagious.\" Officials in Belgium said on Thursday they had culled three contaminated poultry flocks: one in Menin, in the west of the country, another in Dinant in the south and a third in Dixmude in western Flanders. Belgium's federal food safety agency AFSCA, which has ordered poultry owners to lock up their animals to avoid contamination, said that 20 cases of the virus had been found in wild birds. Herve Dupouy, a French producer who heads the local poultry section of the FNSEA farmers federation in the Landes department, a bastion of the foie gras industry, said \"The situation is out of control.\" He called on the state to cull all poultry flocks in the area and impose a two-month production freeze. \"There's no other solution,\" he said. So far the authorities have been culling all ducks and geese within a three-kilometre radius of an infected flock. Free-range chickens and turkeys within that range have also been slaughtered. CIFOQ said on Thursday that government officials had shared plans to expand the culls over a wider area. The bird flu clusters have been detected on poultry farms and in pet shops in the Landes department and the neighbouring Gers and Pyrenees-Atlantique departments. The head of France's chamber of agriculture, Sebastien Windsor, called on Wednesday for \"radical measures\" to try to restore confidence in export markets such as China which announced this week it was suspending French poultry imports over the virus. Producers of foie gras, a pate made from the livers of force-fed ducks or geese, fear a repeat of the devastation wrought by two previous waves of bird flu in the winters of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. More than 25m ducks were culled in the first outbreak, followed by 4.5m the following year, causing a steep decline in foie gras production. Besides France and Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain and Ireland have also reported bird flu outbreaks since the winter began. Dutch authorities culled 190,000 chickens in November after the discovery of the virus at two farms. Outbreaks have also been reported in India and South Korea. In India, tens of thousands of poultry will be slaughtered after an outbreak of deadly avian influenza was found to have killed scores of birds across the country. At least six Indian states have stepped up efforts this week to contain two strains of bird flu H5N1 and H5N8 after the deaths of thousands of migratory birds, ducks, crows and chickens. South Korea's agriculture ministry said on Thursday that it had so far culled 14.9m poultry since identifying its first farm-linked, highly pathogenic bird flu case in late November.

There is no evidence of the strain being transmitted between humans, but Russia has reported the transmission to the World Health Organization. The workers now feel well, and the situation did not develop further according to Dr Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor. She said the workers had been infected during an outbreak of the strain at the plant. Outbreaks of the strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East and north Africa in recent months, but only in poultry. Other strains of bird flu, including H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2, have been transmitted to humans before. The H5N8 strain is deadly for birds, and this marks the first transmission of the strain from animals to humans. While Popova said the strain didn’t appear to be able to spread among humans, only time will tell how soon future mutations will allow it to overcome this barrier. The discovery of this strain gives us all, the whole world, time to prepare for possible mutations and the possibility to react in a timely way and develop test systems and vaccines, she said. The Vector Institute in Siberia said on Saturday that it would start developing human tests and a vaccine against H5N8, according to RIA news agency. Speaking on state TV, Popova said that Russia had reported the developments to the WHO several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results. Most cases of human bird flu infections have been linked to direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered safe. The cases tend to be spread via migrating wild birds, leading producing countries to keep their poultry indoors or segregated from wildlife. Outbreaks of bird flu often lead poultry plants to kill their birds to prevent the virus spreading further, and often prompts other countries to impose trade restrictions. In the UK, five outbreaks of the H5N8 strain in Gloucestershire, Dorset, Devon, Cheshire and Kent were detected in November, leading officials to implement a prevention zone in England, Scotland and Wales.

The reported cases were workers exposed to bird flocks, according to preliminary information, the statement added. The workers were 'asymptomatic and no onward human to human transmission was reported,' the spokesperson said. Speaking during a televised briefing on Saturday, Anna Popova, the head of Russia's Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing, said that the strain had been detected in seven poultry farm workers in the south of the country, state-run news agency TASS reported. While still not confirmed by the WHO, the Russian health authority has said it is in discussion with national authorities to gather more information and 'assess the public health impact' of the incident.

{"id": "20", "title": "A New Bird Flu Jumps to Humans. So Far, It� Not a Problem.", "date": "2021-04-21", "fulltext": "Covid fuels the current virus pandemic, but the world is full of flu viruses waiting in the wings. And they keep changing unpredictably. When a bird flu virus struck a major poultry farm in Russia earlier this year, it was a reminder that the coronavirus causing the pandemic was not the only dangerous virus out there. The authorities quickly tested the birds and moved into high gear, killing 800,000 chickens, disposing of the carcasses and cleaning the farm to stop the potential spread to other chicken farms. But they were also concerned for humans. They tested the birds and sequenced the virus, determining that it was the H5N8 strain of avian flu, highly dangerous to both wild and domestic birds. It is established in Asia and has been increasingly causing deadly outbreaks in birds in Europe. H5N8 viruses have infected some poultry flocks in the United States, but the viruses come from a different though related lineage of virus, distinct from the current H5N8 viruses in Asia and Europe. Flu viruses combine and mutate frequently in unpredictable ways. In the short period from Dec. 25, 2020, to Jan. 14 of this year, more than seven million birds were lost to H5N8 outbreaks in Europe and Asia. Europe alone had 135 outbreaks among poultry and 35 among wild birds. Of course, to put the numbers in context, humans consume about 65 billion chickens each year, and one estimate puts the number of chickens on the globe at any one time at 23 billion. As damaging as H5N8 has been to birds, it had never infected people. Until February. The Russian health authorities also tested about 200 of the people involved in the cleanup of the farm in Astrakhan, using nasal swabs and later blood tests for antibodies. They reported that for the first time, H5N8 had jumped to people. Seven of the workers appeared to have been infected with the virus, although none of them became ill. Only one of those seven cases, however, was confirmed by genetically sequencing the virus. Nonetheless, the potential danger of the new virus and its jump to humans set off alarm bells for Dr. Daniel R. Lucey, a physician and a specialist in pandemics at Georgetown University. He began writing about the Astrakhan event in a blog for other infectious disease experts as soon as it was publicized. He reported that during a television interview, a Russian public health official said the H5N8 virus was likely to evolve into human-to-human transmission. That possibility was frightening. 'The W.H.O. finally put out a report Feb. 26,' he said. But it did not frame the event as particularly alarming because the virus was not causing human disease, and the report judged the risk of human-to-human transmission as low, despite the Russian official's comment. To Dr. Lucey, no one else seemed to be taking the infection of humans with H5N8 as 'of any concern.' He added, 'I think it's of concern.' Other scientists said they were not as worried. Dr. Florian Krammer, a flu researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, said he was more concerned about other avian flu viruses like H5N1 that have already shown themselves to be dangerous to people. Another avian influenza virus, H7N9, infected people for the first time in 2013. There have been more than 1,500 confirmed cases and more than 600 deaths since then. Since 2017 there have been only three confirmed cases and the virus does not jump easily from person to person. It is always possible that any virus can evolve human-to-human transmission, as well as become more dangerous. But H5N8 would have both hurdles to jump. Compared to other viral threats, Dr. Krammer said, 'I'm not worried.' Dr. Richard J. Webby, a flu specialist at the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and director of the W.H.O.'s Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that all of the H5 viruses are of concern because some of them have infected and killed people. But, he said, 'They all have the same sort of binding capacity to human cells, which is limited,' he said. Flu viruses use a slightly different way to attach to cells in birds than to cells in humans and being good at one usually means not being good at the other. Dr. Webby also said that while seven infections would certainly be of concern, only one infection has been confirmed. The tests of the other six involved nasal swabs and blood antibody tests. In people with no symptoms, he said, nasal swabs can simply indicate that they had breathed in virus. That would not mean it had infected them. Blood antibody tests also have a potential for error, he said, and may not be able to distinguish exposure to one flu virus from another. Nor did he see any scientific basis for suggesting that H5N8 is more likely than any other bird flu to evolve human-to-human transmission. But any virus could evolve that ability. Dr. Lucey said that he was heartened to see that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had prepared a candidate vaccine for H5N8 before it had infected humans. Candidate vaccines are simply first steps in planning for potential problems, and have not been through any testing. They exist for many viruses. 'Humans should be routinely tested for the virus, right at the time of the outbreak in birds,' Dr. Lucey said. He favors the protocol followed in Astrakhan, and argues that for any outbreak among birds, public health authorities should test people who are exposed to sick birds with nasopharyngeal swabs and an antibody test, followed by other antibody tests a few weeks later. An upcoming editorial in the journal Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease also takes up the Astrakhan incident and calls for increased monitoring of all H5 viruses.

But unlike with coronaviruses, there are global influenza surveillance systems that watch for human cases of bird flu, since a strain named H5N1 cropped up in the late 1990s in Hong Kong’s crowded live-poultry markets. Between 2013 and 2017, another bird flu named H7N9 infected more than 1,500 people in China through close contact with infected chickens.

The 41-year-old man from Jiangsu province, located northwest of Shanghai, was hospitalized April 28 after developing fever and other symptoms. He was diagnosed with the infection on May 28, according to Reuters, but is now stable and ready to be discharged from the hospital. The health commission said the infection was a result of accidental cross-species transmission. The risk of widespread transmission is low, Chinese officials said, and there are no other human cases of H10N3 reported elsewhere in the world. Avian influenza Type A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds and have been found in more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While these viruses don't normally infect humans, birds can shed virus in their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC says. Human infections can occur if enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth. The CDC says two strains of bird flu viruses have been mostly responsible for human infection and mortality: H7N9 and H5N1. Symptoms of avian influenza A virus infections can range from mild to severe and include conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness such as fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches. Symptoms can also be accompanied by nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and severe respiratory illness, according to the CDC. While it's possible for some of these viruses to jump from birds to humans, they so far don't have the capability of transmitting between humans, said Jürgen Richt, a professor at Kansas State University and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases with the National Institutes of Health. Alpha, Beta, Delta: WHO renames COVID-19 variants with Greek letter names to avoid confusion, stigma COVID origins: Biden tells intelligence agencies to step up probe of COVID-19's origins, including theory of Wuhan lab leak 'This is our biggest fear,' said Richt, who also directs the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases for the Department of Homeland Security. 'If they were to transmit human to human, then we would be at a worse situation than COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates.' This is because bird flu strains can be particularly deadly among human populations. According to the World Health Organization, the case-fatality rate of H7N9 is roughly 30%; H5N1 is 60%. It may be unlikely the H10N3 strain can transmit between humans, Richt said, but scientists can't know for sure until they learn its genetic code and conduct epidemiological surveillance to determine if any other contacts were infected. 'The reason for that is that avian influenza viruses spread among avian species using different receptors than mammalian influenza viruses,' he said. 'In order for these viruses to transmit (among humans), the virus needs to adapt. There're several adaptation steps and, so far, this has not happened with avian flu viruses.'

In a statement, China's National Health Commission emphasized that there was no evidence that the strain had the ability to spread among humans, adding that the risk of a significant outbreak was 'very low.' The patient, a 41-year-old man who lives in the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalized April 28 after having fever symptoms, the National Health Commission said. He was diagnosed with H10N3 a month later. Though the man remains under medical supervision, his condition was described as stable and meeting the standards for discharge. It was not clear from the statement how he caught the virus. The news of the H10N3 infection comes amid the devastation of the covid-19 pandemic, which also was first identified in China and is widely thought to have come to humans from bats through some form of zoonotic spread. A different strain of bird flu, known as H7N9, led to the deaths of around 300 people during an outbreak between 2016 and 2017. But varieties of avian influenza are common in China and, due to increased surveillance of the viruses, relatively easy to find in humans. Unlike in H7N9, there is no evidence that H10N3 can spread easily among humans.

{"id": "27", "title": "What Is Going on With Bird Flu? China Reports First Human Case of H10N3 Strain", "date": "2021-06-04", "fulltext": "Chinese health authorities said a 41-year-old man had contracted a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3 and had been in the hospital since late April, calling it the first reported human case globally from the strain. The National Health Commission said the man developed a fever and other symptoms on April 23 and was admitted to hospital in Jiangsu province five days later. On Tuesday the health commission said his condition was stable and indicated he was ready to be discharged. How did the man become infected? The health commission didn't give details on how the man came into contact with the virus. Cases of bird flu in humans have most commonly been reported among those in close daily contact with poultry, such as chicken farmers. The commission advised the public to avoid contact with sick and dead poultry. Can bird flu kill people? Avian influenza can be fatal in humans. Highly pathogenic strains, such as H5N1, can have a mortality rate of about 60%, according to the World Health Organization. However, the WHO says, bird flu doesn't spread easily from birds to people. How common are bird-flu outbreaks in China? China has seen several outbreaks of bird flu, including one at the height of the coronavirus outbreak last year, when H5N1 avian influenza killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. In May, China's Agriculture Ministry said the H5N8 strain of bird flu killed hundreds of wild birds in Tibet, prompting authorities to disinfect areas including a national wetland park. Are authorities worried? China said the risk of a large-scale outbreak was extremely low. It said local health authorities' contact-tracing and monitoring efforts had found no other cases and no human-to-human transmission. It said the H10N3 strain doesn't have the ability to effectively infect humans. What do experts say? Human infections with bird-flu viruses are rare but not uncommon, said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, a professor at the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. 'It is highly likely that this infection just represents one of the rare incidents of human infection with an avian influenza virus, without any more consequences,' said Prof. Garcia-Sastre. 'Nevertheless, it's important to make sure that this is just that, a rare isolated incident.' The fact that the case happened in April and there hasn't been any other reports of cases suggests there hasn't been a cluster of infections, says Peng Shifang, a professor of infectious diseases at Central South University in China's Hunan province. Is China upfront about the recent bird-flu case? China said it had determined on May 28 through genome sequencing that the man suffered from the H10N3 strain. It issued its statement on the results on Tuesday. While China has been criticized for a lack of transparency in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, its public-health apparatus is generally seen as having become more transparent since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, when official secrecy hampered the response.

A bird flu prevention zone has been declared across Great Britain to stop the spread of the disease among poultry and other birds. Since 5pm on Wednesday, all bird keepers have been legally required to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks. On Wednesday a flock of poultry was culled near Dundee in Scotland after a bird flu outbreak. Earlier this week cases were detected in wild birds and poultry in Wrexham, Wales. The disease has been detected in wild birds at multiple sites across Great Britain. Bird flu circulates naturally among wild birds, and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe in winter the disease can be spread to poultry and other captive birds. In advice published on the Defra website, UK health agencies and food standards agencies say the risk to public health from the virus is very low. According to the NHS, bird flu can affect humans in rare cases if people touch infected birds, their droppings or bedding, or while preparing infected poultry for cooking. Under the prevention zone, people with more than 500 birds must now restrict access for non-essential visitors, change clothing and footwear before entering enclosures, and ensure vehicles are cleaned and disinfected regularly. Areas where birds are kept must be kept unattractive to wild birds, for example by netting ponds and removing food sources. Small backyard owners with only a small number of birds, including chicken, ducks and geese, have been told to limit risks and keep watch for signs of disease. In a joint statement, the chief veterinary officers for England, Scotland and Wales said all bird keepers had to take action. Following a number of detections of avian influenza in wild birds across Great Britain we have declared an avian influenza prevention zone across the whole of Great Britain, the statement said. Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to introduce higher biosecurity standards on your farm or small holding.

The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has put the poultry industry on alert after previous outbreaks led to the culling of tens of millions of birds. It is attracting the attention too of epidemiologists as the virus can be transmitted to humans. China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza so far this year, more than in the whole of 2020. South Korea reported an outbreak at a farm of around 770,000 poultry in Chungcheongbuk-do, the OIE said on Monday, citing a report from the South Korean authorities. All animals were slaughtered. Also in Asia, Japan reported its first outbreak of the 2021 winter season, at a poultry farm in the north-east of the country, the OIE said, confirming a statement last week by Japan's agriculture ministry. The serotype in this outbreak was H5N8. In Europe, Norway reported an H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the Rogaland region in a flock of 7,000 birds, the OIE said.

{"id": "32", "title": "Minister confirms UK has been hit by record bird flu outbreak", "date": "2021-12-09", "fulltext": "George Eustice says restrictions in place since start of November require all birds to be kept indoors The UK has been hit by a record outbreak of avian flu that has led to 500,000 captive birds being culled in recent months. The environment secretary, George Eustice, told the House of Commons: 'This year we are now seeing the largest ever outbreak in the UK of avian influenza, with 36 confirmed cases.' He said an avian influenza prevention zone had been declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. He added: 'Our chief veterinary officer continues to lead the response to this episode.' Earlier the chief vet, Christine Middlemiss, said she was 'very concerned about what's happening.' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme after confirming more outbreaks overnight, she said: 'We now have a total of 40 infected premises in the UK. That's a really high number for the time of year for anything we've experienced before.' By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. Middlemiss said: 'All the birds on the premises have to be culled because of the ongoing risk of infection that they pose. The total number is something like half a million will now have been culled.' She said food supplies would not be hit. 'That sounds a huge number, and for those keepers affected it is really devastating, but it's a relatively very small number in terms of egg supply, meat, chicken and so on.' The disease is spread by migratory wild birds from Europe, where high infections levels are also being recorded. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive for avian flu, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland's Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected avian flu case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on Trotternish, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Middlemiss said almost 300 wild birds had been found with the disease at more than 80 locations. There was 'a lot of virus out there,' she said. The risk to human health is low but infected birds should not be touched. She said: 'It used to be that we would have a reasonable-sized outbreak and then have two or three quiet years. But that's not happening now. We're seeing this across the whole of Europe. We need to understand better why we're getting these ongoing infections every year.' Asked if the disease was still spreading, Middlemiss said: 'We're continuing to get the new detections. I confirmed another two last night and that's the rate we've been going at for the last week or so. We're seeing this as a huge pressure of infection from our wild birds.' Middlemiss urged people with garden bird feeders to 'practice routine hygiene precautions including proper handwashing.' She added: 'If you keep chickens and you want to feed wild birds, you need to make sure that everything is completely scrupulously clean and absolutely separate so that you don't take infection into your own birds and make them sick.' Asked if the climate crisis was to blame for the increased infection, Middlemiss said: 'We don't know specifically, but it's certainly one of the thoughts that our experts are having. The birds migrate to the north of Russia over the summer and mix with other birds on other global flight pathways and exchange the viruses. So it's quite plausible that with climate change and change in pathways that different mixing is going on.'", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "33", "title": "What is bird flu and why is it back in the news?", "date": "2021-12-09", "fulltext": "With the UK hit by a record outbreak, here's a quick guide to the viral disease also known as avian influenza. What is avian flu? Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a contagious viral disease in animals, caused by a virus loosely related to human influenza. Some strains of the disease have been passed to humans but this is very rare, and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals. While all bird species and, less commonly, pigs are thought to be susceptible, domestic poultry flocks are especially vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks can rapidly result in epidemics among bird populations. Public health authorities are concerned about the potential of the virus to mutate into subtypes capable of causing human disease. As a result, they warn there is always a threat of a new influenza pandemic emerging. Why is it in the news again? The UK has been hit by a record outbreak that has resulted in 500,000 captive birds being culled this autumn. An avian influenza prevention zone was declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. What are the most dangerous strains? The NHS says there are four strains that have caused particular concern in recent years. The first, identified in 1997, was H5N1, followed by H7N9 in 2013, H5N6 the following year, and H5N8 in 2016. The H5N1 form has been the cause of most concern in recent years and the UK government has said particular safety measures were put in place in parts of North Yorkshire on 21 November after confirmed and suspected cases of that strain in poultry in the area. Where has it appeared? The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, has said there are 40 infected premises in the UK. They include 38 in Great Britain, of which 33 are in England, and two in Northern Ireland. By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland's Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on the Trotternish peninsula, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Some 22,100 ducks were culled at a commercial premises in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, while culling and an exclusion zone was also being applied to a second site in Broughshane, Co Antrim, described as a 'small backyard flock.' If it just affects birds, why the panic? It doesn't. World Health Organization (WHO) figures show that from 2003 to 2021 there were 863 confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus in humans. Of these cases, 456 people died. While transmission is rare, it has happened. So far, most of the human deaths have been in countries in Asia, in communities in which people live in close proximity to poultry. Although it does not easily infect humans, every time it does it increases the chance that the virus could mutate into a form that could be passed from one infected human to another. The WHO fears this could lead to a flu pandemic. How do you catch bird flu? It is very unlikely you will catch the virus unless you have been in close contact with infected birds or someone with confirmed or suspected bird flu. The virus is found in secretions from the eyes and respiratory tract, and droppings of infected birds. Humans can catch the virus by inhaling droplets sneezed by infected birds or the dust from their bedding or droppings. What are the symptoms in humans? They vary depending on the strain. Most infections have flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and aches and pains. Symptoms of the H5N1 subtype are more severe and frequently result in death. Other symptoms can include conjunctivitis, red, sore and discharging eyes. How does it spread? WHO scientists have said they believe it is likely the virus is carried by migrating birds. More recently the UK government has said it spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. Officials added: 'It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear. Avian influenza isn't an airborne virus.' It can spread to humans who touch infected birds, droppings or bedding or who kill or prepare infected poultry for cooking, the NHS has said. People cannot catch bird flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas affected by an outbreak, health officials have said. What measures is the UK taking? The government has said the chief veterinary officers for each of the UK's constituent nations have agreed to bring in new housing measures to protect poultry and captive birds from avian influenza following a number of confirmed cases across Great Britain in recent weeks. It added: 'The new housing measures, which will come into force on Monday 29 November, mean that it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.' How do you spot the virus in birds? Symptoms in infected birds include a swollen head and blue discoloration around the neck and throat. They will also show signs of breathing problems including gaping beaks, coughing, sneezing and rattling wheezing. Poultry farmers will also notice a loss of appetite in the infected birds and a decrease in egg laying. People are advised not to touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds they find. In Great Britain, dead wild waterfowl or other wild birds should be reported to Defra. Some will then be collected and tested to help scientists understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird. What drug treatments are available to humans? There is no vaccine for avian flu. If a person were infected, the NHS has said they would be either told to stay at home or put into isolation in hospital. They would then be treated with an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (known as Tamiflu) or zanamivir (known as Relenza). Scientists have found that such treatments help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival. They are also sometimes given to people who have been in close contact with infected birds, or those who have had contact with infected people, for example family or healthcare staff, the NHS said.", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that 456 out of 863 confirmed human cases resulted in death.

{"id": "34", "title": "UK reports unprecedented jump in early season bird flu cases", "date": "2021-12-09", "fulltext": "LONDON (AP) — U.K. authorities reported an unprecedented jump in early season cases of avian flu in both domestic and wild birds, triggering tight restrictions on poultry farmers across the country. The government has confirmed 40 outbreaks of avian flu among poultry and other captive birds this year, resulting in the culling of about 500,000 birds, Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said Thursday. There were 24 outbreaks during the entire 2020-21 bird flu season, which ran through the spring. “I’m very concerned about what’s happening,” Middlemiss told the BBC. “That’s a really high number for the time of year for anything we’ve experienced before, and that’s because of the high level of infection in the migratory wild birds. So it’s really, really concerning because those birds will stay with us over the winter until early spring and the risk of infection remains.” U.K. authorities keep a close eye on avian flu cases around the world because it is spread by migrating birds and can be devastating to poultry producers. Experts estimate that outbreaks during the 2014-15 and 2016-17 seasons cost U.K. poultry producers about 125 million pounds ($165 million). While the risk to humans is low, bird flu can affect people in rare cases. To control the spread of the disease, poultry producers must kill all birds at sites where infections are confirmed. In addition, they have been ordered to keep all birds inside or under nets to stop them from coming in contact with wild fowl, and to implement strict hygiene measures. While the number of birds culled so far this season sounds large, it is relatively small compared with the number of birds on U.K. poultry farms. Between the beginning of August and the end of October, poultry producers slaughtered about 20 million birds a week, according to the latest government statistics. “In terms of food supply impact, it’s actually a relatively small number,” Middlemiss said of flu-related culling. The situation in Britain is part of a larger trend across Europe, where authorities are seeing more frequent outbreaks of avian flu, Middlemiss said. Although researchers don’t know the reasons for the trend, one theory is that climate change has altered the migration patterns of wild birds, she said. “The birds migrate to the north of Russia over the summer and mix with other birds and other global flight pathways there and they exchange the viruses, so it’s quite plausible that with climate change and change in pathways different mixing is going on,” Middlemiss said. “But that hasn’t been fully investigated yet.”", "media_outlet": "AP", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

Uri Naveh, a senior scientist at the Israel Parks and Nature Authority, said the situation is not yet under control. \"Many of the birds are dead in the middle of the water body so it's difficult for them to be taken out,\" he said Monday. Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg called the crisis \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country.\" \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" she tweeted. Yaron Michaeli, spokesman for the Hula Lake park, where the crane population is centered, said workers were removing the carcasses as quickly as possible, fearing they could infect other wildlife. Dafna Yurista, spokeswoman for the Agriculture Ministry, said half a million chickens in the area were being slaughtered to prevent the disease from spreading. About 500,000 cranes pass through Israel each year on the way to Africa and a small number stay behind, Michaeli said. This year, an estimated 30,000 cranes stayed in Israel for the winter. Michaeli said it is believed that the cranes were infected by smaller birds that had contact with farms suffering from outbreaks. Israeli media carried photos of workers in white hazmat suits collecting crane carcasses after the birds were first found to be sick about 10 days ago. Michaeli said the death toll among cranes appears to have stabilized in recent days. \"This is a good sign,\" he said. \"They might be starting to get over this. We hope very much.\" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said officials from the agriculture, environment and health ministries were monitoring the situation. There was no immediate information about infections among people, it said. The cleanup is going more slowly than expected. \"We are trying to see if there's any other solutions,\" Naveh said.

As of October, the World Health Organization had confirmed 863 cases of H5N1 in people, 456 of whom died, around the world since 2003. Israel has not recorded any infections in humans this year. Those who have possibly been exposed to the virus are receiving preventive antiviral treatments. Other countries, including Britain, China, Norway and South Korea, have also reported major or higher-than-usual H5N1 outbreaks in recent months. In November, Britain declared a bird flu prevention zone, requiring all farmers to follow stricter biosecurity protocols after several outbreaks. Israel is a central stop along the route of many species of birds migrating from Europe and Asia to Africa, a convergence that raises the risk of avian flu spreading from wild birds to captive poultry populations in the country. Each year, about 500,000 cranes migrate through Israel, some 30,000 of which stayed to winter over there this year. The yearly stopover, often part of journeys lasting thousands of miles, draws the attention of bird enthusiasts, who travel to observe the large, long-legged and long-necked birds. The H5N1 outbreak has wrought \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country,\" Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg said in a tweet Sunday. She shared a photo of dead cranes peppering a lake in Israel's Hula Nature Reserve, a hot spot for migratory birds. \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" Zandberg said. Israel reported its first cases of bird flu in 2006, and has seen outbreaks nearly every year since, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The extent of this year's train of transmission is not yet clear, but regulations require poultry and wild birds be kept separated to limit the chance of transference. Word of Israel's latest outbreak began to spread on Dec. 19, when the Agriculture Ministry reported that H5N1 had been detected in a farming community, Margaliot, near Israel's northern border with Lebanon. The ministry said it had closed off the area and halted egg production. Crowded and unregulated chicken coops are a \"ticking bomb\" for developing diseases, Agriculture Minister Oded Feror said in a statement at the time. That same day, Israeli media reported that about 100 cranes had died in a bird flu outbreak in Hula Lake in a nature reserve in northern Israel. Authorities closed down the area to the public and days later temporarily shut the entire nature reserve. Israel's Nature and Parks Authority shared photos of workers in hazmat suits collecting the bodies of dead cranes from the water. In the following days, outbreaks were detected in at least three other farms in the north as the Agriculture Ministry underwent mass testing. The parks authority said Thursday that an estimated 1 in 5 cranes in Israel were likely to be infected with the virus, Israeli media reported. There have also been reports of deaths from the virus among other bird species. Israel's Agricultural Ministry has warned the public to buy only eggs with the required regulatory stamp and to consume thoroughly cooked eggs to prevent any further spread. The public has also been warned to keep a distance from wild birds. On Tuesday, the ministry told chicken farmers in Margaliot to monitor cats that spend time around the coops, as felines can also become infected with the virus.

JERUSALEM — Israel is acting to contain a severe outbreak of avian flu that has already led to mass culling of infected poultry and has caused the deaths of about 5,000 migratory cranes in a popular nature reserve in the north of the country. The minister of environmental protection, Tamar Zandberg, described the outbreak, identified as the H5N1 type, as 'one of the worst blows to wildlife in Israel's history' after a visit to the Hula Nature Reserve this week. Hula is a wetland that is a central stop on the winter migration route to Africa. The reserve, usually bustling with bird watchers at this time of year, is temporarily closed to visitors and the Ministry of Environmental Protection said on Wednesday that Ms. Zandberg was working to suspend the rest of the hunting season in the country, which normally runs until the end of January. The fear, the ministry said, was that gunshots from bird hunters could cause the wild birds to fly off to other locations, spreading the disease, which it said could also be spread by contaminated car tires on hunters' vehicles or on the soles of their shoes, or by the dogs retrieving their prey. Officials have also warned of the danger of the transmission of avian flu from animals to humans, which could be deadly. No such cases have been recorded in Israel. The first signs of the outbreak came about two months ago, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, with infections cropping up in chicken and turkey farms in different areas of the country. Israel's minister of agriculture and rural development, Oded Forer, said about 600,000 chickens had been culled. He said that would mean a shortfall of 15 million eggs per month over the next few months and that the department was working to import millions of eggs. In an interview with Kan Radio, Israel's public broadcaster, on Tuesday, Mr. Forer blamed the outdated, overcrowded chicken coops that he said were common in Israel for the severity of the outbreak of the virus. The egg industry had been 'neglected for years,' he said, adding that most of the coops in Israel were like those from the 1950s or 60s, and that there was a need to move to more modern coops without cages. More than 100,000 cranes can gather in the Hula Valley during the migration season, which begins in October, according to the reserve, and in recent years many have sojourned there until the spring, when they move back north. The reserve said about 40,000 cranes were documented in the valley early this month. By mid-December the number of dead cranes began to mount up and avian flu was identified as the cause. Most of the dead birds have been found in the water.

The first person in the UK to catch a new strain of bird flu has been named as 79-year-old Alan Gosling, a retired engineer who lived with about 20 ducks inside his home in Devon. Gosling, who had about another 100 ducks living outside on his property in Buckfastleigh, noticed several birds falling ill shortly before Christmas, Devon Live reports. Subsequent tests by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) were returned positive for the H5N1 strain of avian flu. They were subsequently killed shortly after Christmas. Gosling then tested positive for general flu virus and the H5N1 strain of avian flu, first for the strain in the UK. The risk to the wider public continues to be very low, health officials have said, but people have been urged to not touch sick or dead birds. Gosling reportedly welcomed about 20 of the birds into his home as pets after he began feeding the flock. His daughter-in-law, Ellesha Gosling, from Cranbrook, told Devon Live how Gosling begged for their lives to be spared and described the Muscovy ducks as his best friends. She said: \"The past couple of weeks have been hell for this family. He saw all of his ducks killed, and they were like his closest friends.\" The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed on Thursday that a person in the south-west of England had tested positive for bird flu.

The whole of the UK is covered by avian influenza prevention zones, which require bird keepers to take measures to try to stop the disease's spread, such as housing or netting all poultry and captive birds to keep them separate from wild birds, and disinfecting clothing and equipment. Some strains of bird flu can pass from birds to people, but this is extremely rare, according to the UKHSA. It usually requires close contact with an infected bird, so the risk to humans is generally considered very low. Human-to-human transmission of bird flu is also very rare, the organisation said.

(AP) — A duck killed by a hunter in South Carolina had a contagious and dangerous bird flu that has not been detected in the wild in the U.S. in five years, officials said. The flu poses a low risk to people but can spread quickly through chicken houses and other poultry businesses. The Eurasian H5 avian influenza was first detected by Clemson University scientists and confirmed by federal testing, the school said in a news release. The U.S. Department of Agriculture alerted global health officials. Scattered Eurasian H5 infections have been detected in 2022 from Portugal to Bulgaria and in December, two cases were reported in eastern Canada, officials said. Anyone who has poultry, including backyard farms, needs to review their practices to keep birds safe from disease, said State Veterinarian Michael J. Neault, who runs Clemson University's Livestock Poultry Health program. Those practices include thoroughly washing hands before and after handling wild and domesticated birds and using gloves and other protective gear when handling live birds. Farmers should also keep their birds away from areas where geese and ducks roam, clean their cages and coops regularly and buy new birds from reputable sources and keep them away from the rest of the flock for 30 days, the university said. \"So far we have no indication that (the flu) has jumped from wild migratory birds to poultry and we'd very much like to keep it that way,\" Neault said in a statement.", "media_outlet": "AP", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

The RSPB has called for an emergency shooting ban after an 'unprecedented' outbreak of bird flu that has left wildfowl populations in 'catastrophic decline.' Migratory geese that overwinter on the Solway Firth, which stretches between Scotland and Cumbria, are being hardest hit, with a 38% decline in the Svalbard barnacle goose breeding population from winter last year. While these are protected species and not subject to hunting, experts argue that pressure from wildfowlers on nearby, legal quarry species can have an impact. Shoots nearby can cause stress, scaring the birds into the air where they use up vital energy. Some estimates suggest the UK is facing the worst outbreak of avian influenza on record. Latest population counts of the Svalbard breeding population show a drop in numbers from 43,703 in November last year to 27,133 in this month's counts. Paul Walton, the head of habitats and species at RSPB Scotland, said: 'We are in the grip of an unprecedented outbreak and unfortunately the Solway seems to be the epicentre of this in the UK. Our birds are suffering and they need an urgent reprieve to help them get through this winter and ensure that as many as possible of those remaining survive to make their migration back home to Scandinavia to breed in the summer. The best way we can do this is by reducing the cumulative impacts of disturbance, including by wildfowling. Our teams on the ground are seeing many birds that are sick or dying and under significant stress. Anything that can be done to limit activities which incur additional disturbance at this time should be implemented with urgency. This action could help these populations during this period of catastrophic decline caused by the outbreak.' There are allowances under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 for a temporary pause in the hunting of wildfowl if there are prolonged periods of freezing weather. The RSPB is asking for this consideration in the event of a severe avian influenza outbreak. It has also asked the public to keep dogs under close control in the Solway coastal area to avoid further disturbing the birds. After the barnacle goose gained protection in the 1950s, following a long campaign by conservationists, the world population rose from just a few hundred individuals to about 40,000. But the recent sharp decline has made experts concerned the good work could be undone. Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry bird flu. Many bird populations, from chickens to swans, have been hit by the flu, which is deadly. An avian influenza prevention zone came into force across Great Britain on 3 November, meaning birdkeepers must keep their flock separate from wild birds and put strict biosecurity measures in place.

The United States Department of Agriculture said its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza at the farm in Dubois County. State officials have quarantined the farm and its 29,000 turkeys are being euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease, said Denise Derrer Spears, a spokeswoman for the Indiana State Board of Animal Health.

This does not present an immediate concern to public health, federal officials said, but it does have agriculture and industry folks worried. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the confirmed case of the H5N1 strain of avian flu at a farm in Dubois County. It is a highly pathogenic strain, meaning it is lethal to all poultry that contract the disease. This is the nation's first confirmed case of the flu in a commercial operation since 2020 and six years since it was last found on farms in Indiana, when hundreds of thousands of birds were killed as a result.

'This is a foreign animal disease and shouldn't be on our landscape,' said Denise Derrer Spears, the spokeswoman of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. 'That flips the switch and makes this a big deal right off the bat, and we need to stamp it out before it gets out of control.' The response to the outbreak has been swift, both from state and federal agencies as well as the economy. Taiwan has restricted poultry meat and egg products from Indiana while China and Korea blocked non-heated poultry meat from the state, the USDA said on its website. Though limited, these trade restrictions and loss of poultry are a blow to the farm sector and individual producers. You cannot get bird flu from eating fully cooked poultry meat or eggs, according to medical experts. This does not present a food safety risk, and the USDA said turkeys from the affected farm will not enter the food supply. 'But it's a matter of public perception,' Derrer Spears said. The current situation began on Feb. 7, when the affected farmer noticed about 100 birds were dead in one of his barns and the remaining ones were lethargic. He worked with his veterinarian to get samples collected from the flock and sent to a lab at Purdue University. The results were then confirmed at a USDA lab in Iowa. The name of the affected farm has not been publicly identified. As soon as the state received the results, it issued a quarantine at the site and all those farms within a 10-kilometer radius. That includes 17 other operations, Derrer Spears said. She could not give exact numbers on how many birds were impacted, but it's likely more than a few hundred thousand. Dubois County is the top turkey-producing county in Indiana. And Indiana is the third-largest turkey-producing state in the country, the No. 1 state in duck production and the second largest in table eggs and egg-laying chickens. All those farms within the control area will have to test their animals at least once each week to monitor for the disease. The first round of tests came back negative, Derrer Spears said, but the state is remaining very cautious. 'While it's just one incident right now, 18 farms in total are affected by this,' she added. 'There is no cure for this disease, there is no way to save the birds, all birds will die from this so we want to put them down as quickly as possible.' The control area will remain in effect until the affected farm is fully cleaned, the euthanized turkeys are disposed of and no further cases are detected. All turkeys at the infected farm, 29,000 birds, were put down by Wednesday night, according to the state. That depopulation needs to happen as quickly as possible so that the birds do not languish and so the virus does not have more time to spread. The euthanized turkeys will then be disposed of onsite by composting them, a method that is approved and overseen by state and federal agencies. The barns and all equipment will also need to be thoroughly cleaned 'flat off the floor clean,' Derrer Spears said. Once the cleaning is complete and the disposal has reached a certain stage, the quarantine will be lifted. There are many factors involved and there is no target date to do that, the state said it likely will be about four to six weeks. It is unclear how the Dubois County flock was infected. The avian flu viruses are fairly common in wild migratory birds and waterfowl, according to Derrer Spears, and ducks and geese that contract the disease will spread it in their droppings as they fly by. The strain has been wreaking havoc on Asia and Europe and also has been found in some wild birds along the East Coast. Canada recently confirmed H5N1 bird flu in a commercial poultry operation in Nova Scotia. This outbreak is significant because it shows that the strain has entered a migratory pathway for birds called the Mississippi Flyway, which follows the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and includes several major poultry states such as Indiana. The last time this bird flu was found in commercial poultry in Indiana was in January 2016. 'Last time we had this, it was terrible,' Derrer Spears said. That situation similarly started with one flock and then testing showed that it had spread to nearly a dozen other flocks. Ultimately, more than 400,000 birds needed to be euthanized. The year prior, in 2015, the same strain wreaked havoc on the Midwest turkey industry and caused the largest animal disease outbreak ever in the U.S. While Indiana remained largely unscathed from that national outbreak, it led to the destruction of more than 50 million birds and cost the U.S. economy more than $3 billion.", "media_outlet": "USA Today", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

Plagued by underinvestment and disruptions, the 23-nation OPEC Plus alliance has been unable to fully restore the output it halted—a problem the IEA expects to worsen. With oil inventories at the lowest in seven years, the agency sees markets facing further strain. \"The oil market is incredibly tight,\" \"Prices continue to surge and are now reaching levels that are uncomfortable for consumers across the world,\" Toril Bosoni, head of the agency's markets and industry division, said in a Bloomberg television interview on Friday. By the end of the year, the shortfall between the amount of oil OPEC Plus was supposed to have pumped and what it actually delivered since the start of 2021 could amount to 1 billion barrels, the IEA estimates. Rising prices have been an acute source of pain for major economies, fanning a surge in inflation. Bloomberg News Under Armour beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Friday, as the sportswear maker benefited from strong demand for its athletic wear and higher prices of its hoodies and leggings to counter inflation. Athletic wear has become a major part of everyday fashion since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, helping Under Armour and its rivals Lululemon, Athletica and Nike book outsize gains in sales. Under Armour's net revenue in North America increased 15 percent in the fourth quarter. Luxury watches from the German village of Glashuette are gaining protected status similar to bubbly wine coming from the Champagne region in France. The country's upper house of parliament on Friday signed off on the so-called Glashuette Decree, ensuring that only timepieces made in the town of about 7,000 people in the eastern state of Saxony are permitted to display the vaunted name. The town boasts the greatest concentration of world-class watchmakers outside Switzerland.

The USDA reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a flock of about 240,000 birds at a commercial chicken farm in Fulton County, Ky. Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. chicken processor by sales, confirmed that the farm housed the company's chickens. A separate outbreak was confirmed in a backyard flock of birds in Fauquier County, Va., the USDA said. State officials quarantined the affected areas, and the birds on the farms will be destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease. Federal and state authorities are surveilling and testing areas around the affected flocks, the USDA said. None of the affected birds will enter the food supply, according to the USDA. Recent avian-influenza outbreaks haven't posed a health risk to humans, federal officials have said. A severe outbreak in the U.S. could pose a threat to poultry companies such as Tyson, Perdue Farms Inc., Sanderson Farms Inc. and Pilgrim's Pride Corp. Meat companies are already raising prices as they cite worker shortages that have left them unable to meet customer demand, as well as higher transportation and feed costs. Tyson is working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus, a spokesman said, and the company doesn't expect the affected farm in Kentucky to affect its overall chicken production levels. Tyson Foods said last week on its quarterly earnings call with analysts that the Arkansas-based company has increased biosecurity protections in its East Coast facilities, taking extra time to clean vehicles that go to farms and reducing the number of trips to farms overall. 'We have very robust biosecurity measures in place across all of our facilities, and that includes testing every flock for avian influenza,' David Bray, group president of poultry for Tyson, said on the call. Multiple bird-flu cases have been reported across North America in recent weeks, prompting poultry companies to take action. Avian influenza has been confirmed in commercial and backyard flocks in three states this year, the USDA said. An outbreak was reported last week in Dubois County, Ind., on a commercial turkey farm. Earlier this month, bird flu was detected in two wild birds in Florida. In January, a separate case was found in a wild bird in Colleton County in South Carolina, according to the USDA. Canada also recently confirmed a bird-flu case in a commercial turkey farm in western Nova Scotia. The U.S. poultry industry has remained largely unaffected by the disease since an outbreak in 2015 led to the deaths of more than 50 million chickens and turkeys. Since then, chicken, turkey and egg processors invested in new biosecurity measures and other precautions to stem the disease's spread Perdue Farms said none of the recent outbreaks have affected its flocks, but the positive cases are concerning, a company spokeswoman said. The Maryland-based company is having all of its flock advisers visit the farmers in their service area to review biosecurity protocols, she said. Shares of Tyson closed down about 3% Monday. Shares of Sanderson Farms and egg giant Cal-Maine Foods Inc. both declined about 1%, while Pilgrim's Pride declined 0.5%. Major stock indexes declined by less than 1%. Any immediate impact on poultry companies' sales is likely to be minimal, because chicken-importing countries may decide to continue purchasing U.S. poultry products from states where bird flu hasn't been detected, said Christine McCracken, executive director of meat research at agricultural lender Rabobank. A bigger impact on exports could come if the virus is reported in major poultry producing states like Arkansas, she said. 'It is being carried by wild birds so there isn't much control over the spread other than traditional biosecurity measures,' Ms. McCracken said. 'It's still early in the season, but it wouldn't be surprising if additional cases are found.' Labor shortages on farms also may increase the risk of spreading the virus, she said. Chicken producers are relying on a smaller number of available workers to clean more farms, and newer workers may not be as efficient at certain hygiene practices, she said.

{"id": "50", "title": "US bird flu case puts chicken, turkey farms on high alert", "date": "2022-02-15", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Farms that raise turkeys and chickens for meat and eggs are on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity, fearing a repeat of a widespread bird flu outbreak in 2015 that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion. The new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana. The 29,000 turkeys in the flock were killed to prevent the spread of the virus. Indiana officials said Tuesday a second flock of 26,473 turkeys near the first infected farm is suspected to have the same virus. Testing is underway to confirm. The second location already is within a quarantine zone established for the first farm. The USDA also has confirmed the presence of bird flu in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and are awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky. A backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also is positive for the virus. State officials quarantined areas and the birds at the new positively identified sites will be killed and removed. The poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they're urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry. Egg, turkey and chicken prices could rise and availability could drop if birds at enough farms were to be infected. It's definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry, said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. I feel positive that we can tackle this situation better and I have my fingers crossed that this will be an isolated case, however, I would hope for the best and be prepared for the worst. Health officials say no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S. and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern. The virus can spread from infected birds to people but such infections are rare and haven't led to sustained outbreaks among humans. The 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer, and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation's leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The disease caused egg and turkey prices across the country to soar for months, with the cost of eggs up 61% at one point and prices for boneless, skinless turkey breasts rising 75% between May and July 2015. The outbreaks were deemed the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history, costing the government nearly $1 billion for removal and disposal of infected birds and government indemnity payments to producers for the lost birds. The strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus. It has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified. Migratory wild birds often carry strains of avian influenza and they're often low pathogenic, which means they don't kill the birds. Sometimes those strains can get into domestic flocks and mutate into more deadly viruses. The H5N1 now spreading from wild birds is already highly pathogenic, which means it is deadly from the start, said Dr. Yuko Sato, a veterinarian and assistant professor in the Department of Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine at Iowa State University. U.S. surveillance efforts have identified the virus in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and South Carolina, making it apparent that it is in the environment broadly. The virus spreads easily from wild bird droppings and can be carried into commercial flocks on the feet of workers or on equipment, which is why high-level biosecurity protocol has been activated across the country in commercial operations. They've enacted new safeguards to prevent deadly bird flu infections, often referred to as HPAI, and isolate them when they occur. With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection, said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA, which deals with outbreaks on U.S. Federal and state officials are working with the poultry industry and have initiated steps such as an immediate quarantine that restricts movement of poultry and equipment used to move birds in and out of specified perimeters around an infected barn — usually around 6 miles (10 kilometers) initially — and eradication of the virus by killing and removing birds at the infection site. Testing occurs in the quarantine area of both wild and domestic birds. Disinfection is done to kill the virus at the affected farm and testing is used to confirm it's free of the virus. Producers who want to ensure eligibility for government indemnity payments in case of disaster must have a biosecurity protocol on hand that is updated regularly. To help with that, the USDA has developed a 14-point biosecurity plan for producers, which is audited yearly and reviewed every two years by state agriculture agencies, Sato said. In Iowa, a state with 49 million chickens, egg farmers are working with state and federal authorities to keep the disease out of their flocks, said Kevin Stiles, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council. IPA is maintaining open communications specifically related to biosecurity best practices and is offering surveillance testing.

{"id": "51", "title": "Highly lethal bird flu found in Ky. and Va. flocks, raising fear of wider outbreak in poultry farms", "date": "2022-02-15", "fulltext": "Poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia were confirmed to have birds infected with a highly lethal form of avian flu, federal agriculture officials said Monday, days after a flock of turkeys in Indiana tested positive, raising worries about a wider outbreak in the country. The most recently identified infections occurred at a Tyson Foods commercial broiler in Fulton County, Ky., that has 240,000 chickens, and in a backyard flock of mixed species in Fauquier County, Va. Kentucky officials said they were also waiting for the results of tests on a flock of turkeys in Webster County. The infections come after 29,000 turkeys were destroyed in Indiana once officials detected the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County. Federal officials said the Indiana outbreak was the first confirmed case in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020. The developments raise concerns that avian influenza could affect more poultry operations in the United States, which is the world's top producer of poultry and the No. 2 exporter in volume, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. They also come as the United States is seeing higher than usual inflation rates in necessities such as food. Avian influenza is carried by wild bird populations that spread the virus to domestic birds. Outbreaks involving more virulent strains result in higher mortality rates in domestic birds, potentially causing disruptions to the food supply. The outbreak in Fulton County was found after the operation reported an increase in poultry deaths to Kentucky officials. Avian influenza doesn't pose a public health risk to humans, U.S. agriculture officials said, so long as poultry and eggs are properly cooked at internal temperatures above 165 degrees. No human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the United States, although more than 700 global cases have been reported since 2003, federal officials say. Officials have quarantined the operations in Kentucky and Virginia, the Agriculture Department said, and birds at the locations will not enter the food system. Tyson Foods is heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, Gary Mickelson, a company spokesman, said in an emailed statement. The company tests all flocks for avian influenza before the birds leave the farms, he said. The recent outbreak will not affect Tyson's overall chicken production, because thousands of farms raise the birds for the firm, he added. In a deadly outbreak that occurred between December 2014 and June 2015, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys either died of HPAI or were killed to stop the disease's spread, according to the Agriculture Department. The federal government spent almost $880 million at the time to pay for the destruction of infected poultry, cleaning and indemnities for lost birds. The outbreak also led to a $1.1 billion decrease in exports of broiler chickens in 2015, compared with the prior year.

The new cases were reported last week when nearly 30,000 turkeys at a southern Indiana farm were euthanized after the H5N1 strain of avian flu was detected, the first time it had been seen in the U.S. since 2020. But on Monday and Tuesday, health officials said the same flu strain had been detected in 26,000 turkeys on another Indiana farm, as well as in a mixed flock of birds in Virginia and a flock of broiler chickens at a Tyson Foods farm in Kentucky. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the farms are quarantined and the birds in Virginia have been euthanized. The same will be done to those in Indiana and Kentucky, and another farm in western Kentucky is waiting on lab results. \"The risk is too high of spread to wait until the laboratory confirmation comes in, especially with the presumptive positive and clinical signs in the birds already,\" said Denise Derrer Spears, spokesperson for the Indiana board of animal health. \"So the owners are taking action to prevent further spread.\" There are an estimated 246,000 chickens at the Tysons farm, but it is unclear how many will be euthanized. Tyson Foods said in a statement to USA TODAY that they were working with Tennessee and Kentucky state officials, as well as federal officials, to prevent the spread. \"Tyson Foods is prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing. This includes heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, placing additional restrictions on outside visitors and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms. Tyson Foods' chicken products remain safe: the USDA confirms that avian influenza does not pose a food safety risk to consumers in poultry that is properly prepared and cooked. \"Because the affected farm in Kentucky is only one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for our company, the situation is not expected to impact our overall chicken production levels,\" the statement read. It is unclear how the latest bird flu cases began, but health officials have noted that migratory wild birds are likely spreading the disease. \"At this time, our goal is to continue to monitor the presence of (highly pathogenic avian influenza) in wild bird populations, and to quickly identify any instances where the virus spreads to commercial or backyard birds,\" the USDA said in a statement to USA TODAY. Kevin Stiles, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council, told The Associated Press steps were being taken to prevent the flu from entering the state. The state is the nation's leading egg producer and is home to 49 million chickens. \"IPA is maintaining open communications specifically related to biosecurity best practices and is offering surveillance testing. We are confident in our producers' preparedness and ability to manage their flocks,\" Stiles said. The National Chicken Council added the chicken industry remains on \"high alert,\" but plans are in place to control the spread of the virus.

Symptoms of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in birds include sneezing, coughing, walking or swimming in circles, and swelling of the legs and feet, the D.C. nonprofit City Wildlife said in a statement Tuesday. HPAI can also cause sudden death. Found in domestic and wild species, HPAI is highly contagious among birds. Although wild waterfowl are the most common carriers, they are often asymptomatic while birds of prey, such as hawks and owls, and scavengers, such as crows and gulls, may show more severe infection. Though not reported in the District yet, HPAI appears to be drawing closer. The U.S. Agriculture Department reported the disease Feb. 14 among a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Va. The disease is not an immediate public health concern, the USDA said in a statement, and no human cases have been detected. Cassie Shirk, director of legislation and government relations for the Maryland Agriculture Department, said USDA data showed multiple positive tests in wild birds in the Atlantic Flyway, including a duck in Kent County.

{"id": "62", "title": "Avian Flu Spread in the U.S. Worries Poultry Industry", "date": "2022-02-24", "fulltext": "Though the risk to humans is low, scientists warn that outbreaks among farmed birds increase the potential for the virus to mutate and pose a threat to humans. A highly contagious and deadly form of avian influenza has been barreling across the eastern half of the United States in recent weeks, killing both wild birds and farmed poultry and raising fears that an unchecked outbreak could prove calamitous for an industry that was devastated by a similar virus seven years ago. Since early January, when it began killing chickens in northeast Canada, the virus has been identified in migratory waterfowl from Florida to Maine, and has infected backyard chickens in Virginia and New York and sickened thousands of turkeys in Kentucky and Indiana, prompting mass cullings and import bans. On Wednesday, federal officials announced that the virus, a so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza, had been found in a Delaware commercial chicken farm on the Delmarva Peninsula, home to one of the country's largest concentrations of poultry farms. Experts suspect wild birds returning from winter feeding grounds are spreading the virus, most likely through contaminated droppings. With the peak springtime migration still weeks away, many fear the worst is yet to come. 'It's very concerning given how quickly this thing is accelerating,' said Henry Niman, a biochemist in Pittsburgh who studies the genetic evolution of viruses and has been tracking the outbreak's spread across the country. 'I think we could see historic levels of infections.' Federal officials have been urging poultry growers to report sick or dying birds and to tighten their farms' biosecurity measures, which includes preventing contact between wild birds and domestic animals. 'It's important to note that avian influenza is not considered to be a risk to public health and it's not a food-safety risk,' Mike Stepien, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in an email. Although the danger to humans is low, scientists are keeping a close eye on the virus, the Eurasian H5N1, which is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry. That virus does not spread efficiently among humans, but it is extremely deadly, with a fatality rate of 60 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The strain currently spreading across the United States has not jumped to humans, but virologists and epidemiologists say the mounting infections among birds is worrisome because it increases the possibility that the virus could mutate in ways that make it more infectious to people. Dr. Gail Hansen, a public health veterinarian who is the former state epidemiologist for Kansas, noted that influenza viruses have historically been behind the pandemics that affect humans. Some medical historians have traced the deadly influenza pandemic of 1918 to Army recruits in Kansas who may have caught the pathogen from farm animals and then spread it to military camps in Europe. 'Scientists always assumed the next pandemic would be a respiratory influenza,' she said. 'We were wrong with Covid, but it's these kinds of viruses that keep us awake at night.' The virus has also been coursing through Asia, the Middle East and Europe. In recent weeks, 300 outbreaks have been reported in 29 European countries. In Israel, an outbreak at a nature reserve killed thousands of cranes. At the moment turkey farmers, especially those in Indiana and Kentucky, are most worried. Over the past two weeks, several farms in those states have been shuttered after officials discovered the virus among birds that spend their entire lives crammed into massive sheds. Farmers say they have been stunned by how efficiently the virus kills, with animals dying hours after the initial infection. In Indiana, state officials have moved quickly, euthanizing more than 100,000 birds and throwing a six-mile cordon around affected farms — a containment area within which exports are halted and birds are tested daily. 'Everyone is on super-high alert and trying to be as prepared as possible because we all remember the devastation of 2014 and 2015,' said Dr. Denise Heard, a veterinarian with the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. The 2014-15 outbreak is considered the most destructive in the nation's history. It sent poultry and egg prices soaring and cost the industry more than $3 billion — though the federal government compensated farmers for lost flocks. In the end, nearly 50 million birds were killed by the virus or destroyed to prevent its spread, a vast majority of them in Iowa and Minnesota. John Burkel, 54, a fourth-generation turkey grower in northern Minnesota, has been watching the spread with trepidation. In 2015, the virus tore through his farm in a matter of days, leaving just 70 survivors in a shed that had held 7,000 birds. The weeks that followed were spent culling, composting the dead and then repeatedly disinfecting the barns. As a precaution, health officials also advised that he and his son take a course of the antiviral drug Tamiflu. 'We've never seen a virus that virulent,' said Mr. Burkel, a state legislator who works the farm with his wife and two children. 'It was just horrible.' Since then, agriculture officials across the country have pushed farmers to embrace an array of biosecurity measures aimed at preventing outbreaks. They include sealing up tiny holes that might allow mice or sparrows to enter barns, disinfecting the tires of feed-delivery trucks before they enter a farm and creating 'clean' and 'dirty' zones where workers can change into fresh footwear and coveralls before stepping inside an animal containment shed. At the same time, experts say that federal officials have strengthened the nationwide system of surveillance that allows researchers to track, in almost real time, an avian flu's spread within wild bird populations. 'I think the crisis of 2015 made us realize it takes a village to prevent an outbreak and has left us much better prepared,' said Dr. Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian at Iowa State University who advises local farmers about improving their biosecurity practices. But hypervigilance has its limits, especially against a microscopic pathogen that can infiltrate a barn on the leg of a single housefly. For a growing number of scientists, the real threat is the nation's industrialized system of meat and dairy production, with its reliance on genetically identical creatures packed by the thousands inside huge confinement sheds. Nearly all the nine billion chickens raised and slaughtered in the United States each year can trace their lineage to a handful of breeds that have been manipulated to favor fast growth and plump breasts. The birds are also exceptionally vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. 'They all have the same immune system, or lack of an immune system, so once a virus gets inside a barn, it's going to spread like wildfire,' said Dr. Hansen, the public health veterinarian. Andrew deCoriolis, the executive director of Farm Forward, a sustainable agriculture advocacy group, said the lack of genetic diversity isn't just a threat to the nation's food supply; it is also a potential threat to public health. More than half the 22 strains of novel influenza virus that the C.D.C. has identified as 'of special concern' to human health are avian influenza viruses, he said, noting that a 2018 study examining the emergence of 39 highly pathogenic avian viruses found that all but two of them had emerged on industrial poultry farms. He said the sector's emphasis on biosecurity and infection containment obscures a larger, thornier issue that requires a fundamental rethinking of meat and egg production in the United States. 'Instead of asking how factory farms can prevent infections that originate in the environment, which is how they frame it now, we should be asking how they can prevent infections that originate on factory farms,' he said. 'If we keep raising more and more animals in these conditions, we should expect the exact outcome we're getting because that's how the system is set up.'

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in the flock of fewer than 50 birds in Pottawattamie County. State officials quarantined the affected location and the birds were killed and incinerated to prevent the spread of the disease. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said since it was a small noncommercial flock there would be no resulting trade or supply chain issues. “The virus does appear to be very prevalent in wild birds so the next few months during the northern migration in the Mississippi flyway will be a time of high alert for all poultry owners,” he said. Cases have been discovered in flocks across the nation in the past month. The first infection was identified in a commercial flock of turkeys in Indiana on Feb. 9. Since then, five more flocks have been found with cases in Indiana, where more than 171,000 birds have been killed and removed. The virus also was detected in flocks of turkeys and broiler chickens in Kentucky last month, resulting in the destruction and disposal of more than 284,000 birds. A commercial chicken flock in Delaware also was infected, leading to the disposal of 1.2 million birds, the USDA said. A noncommercial backyard case also was identified Wednesday in Connecticut. Similar cases have been found in backyard flocks in recent days in Michigan, Maine, New York and Virginia.

{"id": "71", "title": "Bird flu confirmed in northwest Iowa commercial turkey flock", "date": "2022-03-07", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) Officials announced Monday that they have identified bird flu in a commercial flock of 50,000 turkeys in northwest Iowa, the state's second case of a virus that has been identified in multiple U.S. states. Iowa agriculture officials and the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the case in Buena Vista County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the case identified March 1 in a backyard flock of 42 ducks and chickens in Pottawattamie County. Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a disaster proclamation for Buena Vista County to allow state resources to help with disposal of the affected flock and disinfection of the farm. Officials didn't immediately disclose the number of birds involved. The emergency declaration also provides resources for tracking, monitoring and the rapid detection of bird flu. The turkeys have been killed and disposed of on the farm. A 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) control area has been established to limit traffic in and out of the area while extensive testing is done to ensure no other cases, said State Veterinarian Dr. Jeff Kaisand. He said five other commercial farms are within the zone and 37 backyard flocks. The discovery of avian influenza is especially troubling in Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer. In 2015, an outbreak led producers to kill 33 million hens in the state and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation's leading turkey producer. Smaller outbreaks were reported in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said in a statement that state and federal agriculture officials are working with producers to trace back, control and eradicate this disease from our state. Naig told reporters that if the virus spreads significantly into commercial egg, chicken or turkey populations, then consumer prices and product availability could become an issue. Cases have been reported in at least 12 states in backyard flocks and commercial production houses. We're not seeing a massive outbreak on a large scale and so I think it's too soon to be concerned about food impact or pricing impact at this point, but you have to acknowledge that can be an issue over time, he said. Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can spread from flock to flock by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the recent bird flu detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. While it can be transmitted to humans, it is unusual and typically due to close contact with infected birds. The first infection this year was identified in a commercial flock of turkeys in Indiana on Feb. 9. Since then, five additional flocks have been found with cases in Indiana, where more than 171,000 birds have been killed and removed. The virus also was detected in a flocks of turkeys and broiler chickens in Kentucky last month, resulting in the destruction and disposal of more than 284,000 birds. A commercial chicken flock in Delaware also was infected, leading to the disposal of 1.2 million birds, the USDA said. In the past few days officials have identified the virus on a southeast Missouri farm with 240,000 broiler chickens, a commercial mixed species flock in southeastern South Dakota and an egg-laying hen operation in northeast Maryland. On Monday, Nebraska officials confirmed the state's first known discovery of the virus this year, in a wild goose near Holmes Lake in Lincoln.

Increasing levels of exposure will be harmful for animal health and reduce meat and dairy production in many parts of the world, according to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of the world's leading climate scientists. The world's first octopus farm looks set to open in the Canary Islands as government officials carry out an environmental assessment on plans for a facility starting in 2023. Animal rights activists have protested against the plans, with octopuses known to be intelligent and inquisitive as seen in the Netflix film My Octopus Teacher. One egg a day for everyone on the planet is the aim of an initiative to double global egg consumption over the next decade. Mexico and Japan lead the way at present with a per capita consumption of more than 300 eggs a year. Almost all of Japan's egg producers use battery cages as it continues to resist international pressure to improve welfare conditions for chickens. Europe's largest egg producer, France, has banned the slaughter of male chicks. The industry has until the end of 2022 to comply. Farmers will be required to look at alternative methods to ensure male chicks are not born, including the use of technology that enables the sex of the embryo to be identified before they develop into chicks and hatch. France is also trialling avian influenza vaccines as countries across Europe battle one of the worst winters for the disease on the continent. Any vaccine is complicated by the numerous strains of bird flu and the bans some countries have on importing poultry meat from countries that vaccinate birds. An outbreak of a deadly pig disease African swine fever was covered up by officials in Thailand, it has been claimed. The government denies the accusation and said most pig deaths were from another deadly disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. Meanwhile, the World Bank is funding a project to scale-up intensive pig farming in Vietnam. A provision to ban commercial mink farms in the US has been added to a bill making its way through Congress. Most countries in the EU have now banned fur farming, with the UK the first country to do so in 2000. China is on its way to becoming the world's biggest producer. UK news Farmed fish should have the same legal protection as other farmed animals, say animal welfare activists. The Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, which has the prime minister's wife Carrie Johnson as a patron, says fish deserve to be treated with the same care as cows, pigs, sheep and other livestock because they experience stress and pain. Herefordshire county council is asking residents if their health and wellbeing has been affected by intensive chicken farms. Of the 1.1 billion broiler chickens slaughtered each year in Britain, about 25% are raised in Herefordshire and Shropshire. A surge in poultry farms means there are 70 times more chickens than people in the two counties. Vets have described undercover footage showing cows from a Welsh dairy farm being kicked, hit with shovels and mistreated as 'abuse' and 'totally unnecessary.' The farm was stripped of its membership of the red tractor assurance scheme, which admitted that some welfare breaches are not always detectable during its inspections. The UK may no longer move ahead with a ban on the import and sale of fur and foie gras, according to reports. The ban had been proposed in the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto. British farmers have been banned from making foie gras 'created by force-feeding ducks or geese' since 2000. The use of critically important antibiotics on UK dairy farms fell by 98% between 2018 and 2021, according to an industry study. The vast majority of farm antibiotics in the UK are used in the pig and poultry sectors, both of which have reported significant reductions in recent years. From the Animals farmed series Satellite data shows more than 400 sq miles (1,000 sq km) of Amazon rainforest has been cleared for cattle and maize on farms growing soya, undermining claims crop is deforestation-free. US president Joe Biden's pledge during Cop26 to reduce methane emissions by almost one-third has not, apparently, resulted in any limits on one of the country's biggest emitters: the beef sector. Industry figures admitted they had escaped 'relatively unscathed' but observers warned the US would never meet Biden's 2030 climate reduction goals without regulation. There have been renewed calls in the US to ban 'cruel' on-farm killing methods as the country braces itself for an increase in bird flu outbreaks. Using firefighting foam to suffocate animals and ventilation shutdown, in which animals are killed with extremely high heat and steam, are still permitted in the US, despite being labelled 'inhumane.'

Bruce Danckwerts from Zambia writes: I fully agree that there is a very strong case against factory farming of all animals (not just ruminants) 'that we must find a much more ethical way of slaughtering our animals' that there is too much meat (and waste) in the modern American diet. However, the evidence suggests that without livestock, our soils will continue to deteriorate. We must be careful not to ban the good ways, just because we want to eliminate the bad ways.

In the UK, farmers have been ordered to keep their birds indoors since last November and as of this week have been prevented from selling their eggs as free range. The latest reported outbreak, at a farm in Suffolk last weekend, led to more than 80,000 ducks being culled after confirmation of a highly pathogenic variant of avian flu. 'There is a serious problem for free-range and outdoor farms,' said Dr Guillaume Fournié, a veterinarian and epidemiologist at the Royal Veterinary College. 'We are seeing outbreaks on large [indoor] poultry farms that would have had high biosecurity. This suggests that with high environmental exposure to the virus, now it's hard to ensure a farm is 100% biosecure.' Marion Koopmans, a virologist and adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO), said the situation was 'horrible' for the free-range poultry industry. 'The ecology [of avian flu] has changed drastically in just a few years. We now have local circulation all year round in Europe, it's not just a seasonal threat. It has a permanent presence in the wild bird population.' Highly pathogenic avian flu is already endemic in a number of countries in Asia, with infection of poultry reported all-year round. 'The question [in the UK/Europe] is whether sedentary (non-migratory) wild birds will maintain the virus circulation over the summer. This would mean a constant pressure of infection on poultry farms, which would then increase seasonally with migratory birds,' said Fournié. Koopmans, who took part in the WHO's Covid mission to China in 2021, said higher levels of biosecurity, vaccination of chickens and reductions in intensive poultry farms in parts of Europe may all be needed to prevent outbreaks. Measures to ensure biosecurity and prevent infection reaching hens include cleaning and disinfecting, safe storage of feed and water and quarantining new stock. France, which has experienced close to 1,000 avian flu outbreaks this winter, has been trialling avian influenza vaccines, but the solution has been complicated by the numerous variants of avian flu. The market for free-range eggs has grown rapidly in the UK over the past decade. Last year, almost two-thirds of 11 billion eggs produced in the UK last year were free-range, up from 27% in 2004. The Co-op, Sainsbury's, M&S, Morrisons and Waitrose no longer stock eggs that are not free-range. Some have suggested introducing covered outdoor areas or changing the rules for free-range egg producers to allow for longer periods spent indoors. However, it is unclear how consumers would react to this shift. 'The whole point of free-range is they have the opportunity to roam outside,' said Andrew Knight, a veterinary professor at the University of Winchester. Radically changing the rules for free-range eggs would be wrong, said Dan Crossley, from the Food Ethics Council. 'I think most people have a reasonable understanding of what free-range is, so what we want to avoid is muddying the water and any confusion around what different terms mean.' UK government officials have said there are no plans to review the existing legislation, which provided producers with a 16-week 'derogation' during which the free-range description can be kept on eggs even though the hens have been confined. Mark Williams, chief executive of the British Egg Industry Council, said he was confident that hens would be allowed outside again soon. 'The greatest risk comes when the migratory birds are carrying it around, which is why we have these outbreaks at the same time every year between Autumn and Spring,' he said. The UK Health Security Agency said there was year-round avian flu surveillance of dead wild birds. 'Despite recording a record number of outbreaks this season, the risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low,' said a spokesperson. Transmission from an infected bird to a human is very rare, according to health officials, with fewer than five cases recorded in the UK, most recently in January, when a man caught it from ducks he kept inside his home.", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

(AP) — Avian influenza has been confirmed in wild birds found in three southeastern Michigan counties, the state Department of Natural Resources says. The DNR announced Thursday that highly pathogenic avian influenza had been detected in free-ranging Canada geese and tundra swans from St. Clair County, in snowy owls from Macomb County and in a mute swan from Monroe County. The discovery comes as millions of turkeys and chickens at commercial farms in numerous states have been killed this year due to avian influenza. The spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings of wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which often show no signs of illness. DNR Director Dan Eichinger said Michigan's ongoing focus is working to prevent the disease's spread in wildlife and domestic poultry in the state. He said that in light of Michigan's confirmed positive cases of avian flu in wild birds, officials are taking advantage of every available resource that aims to limit the spread of HPAI. The bird flu outbreak among commercial flocks in the U.S. was first detected in February in a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.

{"id": "88", "title": "Avian flu is infecting U.S. poultry flocks. It could affect the price of chicken, too", "date": "2022-03-26", "fulltext": "Ready for more bad infectious diseases news? There's an outbreak of bird flu making its way into U.S. poultry flocks. If the virus continues to spread, it could affect poultry prices—already higher amid widespread inflation. The price of chicken breasts this week averaged $3.63 per pound at U.S. supermarkets—up from $3.01 a week earlier and $2.42 at this time last year, the Agriculture Department says. This week an outbreak was confirmed at a commercial flock in Nebraska, causing 570,000 broiler chickens to be destroyed. In Delaware and Maryland, more than two million birds at commercial poultry flocks have been affected. In South Dakota, an outbreak last week led to the killing of 85,000 birds. An outbreak confirmed March 14 at a commercial operation in Wisconsin meant more than 2.7 million egg-laying chickens were killed. The latest data from the USDA show 59 confirmed sites of avian flu across commercial and backyard flocks in 17 states since the start of the year. That figure includes chickens, turkey and other poultry. The USDA identified a case of avian flu in a wild bird in mid-January, the first detection of the virus in wild birds in the U.S. since 2016. Wild birds can spread the virus to commercial and backyard flocks. By Feb. 9, the virus had been identified in a commercial flock in Indiana. There have since been hundreds of confirmed cases of wild birds infected with avian flu. The last major avian flu outbreak in the U.S. was from December 2014 to June 2015, when more than 50 million chickens and turkeys either died from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or were destroyed to stop its spread. During that outbreak, chicken breast prices increased 17%, according to agriculture data company Gro Intelligence. But at the same time, prices for cuts of chicken geared toward the export market actually dropped due to bans on importing U.S. poultry in countries including China, South Korea, Cuba and Mexico. So the cost of leg quarters, for instance, dropped 18%, according to the data. Poultry prices—especially for eggs and turkey—were affected for years, the company reports. The impact on prices this time depends on how widespread the flu becomes. Whether the 2022 avian flu will affect the price of eggs and poultry depends on how widespread it becomes, says Ron Kean, a poultry science expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences. \"In 2015, we did see quite an increase in egg prices,\" Kean told Wisconsin Public Radio. \"The chicken meat wasn't severely affected at that time. We did see quite a loss in turkeys, so turkey prices went up. So, we'll see. If a lot of farms contract this, then we could see some real increases in price.\" What's the risk to humans from this bird flu? Not much so far, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the CDC's most recent update on March 7, the H5N1 bird flu poses a low risk to the public, and is currently \"primarily an animal health issue.\" The CDC notes that some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection. You can't get avian flu from eating poultry or eating eggs that are properly prepared and cooked, the USDA explains. The chance of infected poultry entering the food chain is extremely low, the agency says, because of its food inspection program and avian flu response plan. \"All poultry products for public consumption are inspected for signs of disease both before and after slaughter,\" the USDA notes, and avian flu causes a rapid onset of symptoms in poultry. For producers who suspect their flock may be affected by avian flu, the USDA has a guide to the warning signs, including a sudden increase in bird deaths, lack of energy and appetite, and a decrease in egg production. If a flock is found to be infected by bird flu, the USDA moves quickly—within 24 hours—to assist producers to destroy the flock and prevent the virus from spreading.", "media_outlet": "NPR", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

One of the new outbreaks will lead to the killing of 1.5 million chickens at an egg-laying farm in Guthrie County, about 60 miles west of Des Moines. The other was at a turkey farm in Hamilton County, about 65 miles north of Des Moines, where 28,000 birds will be killed. After they are killed, birds typically are buried in compost pits on the farms. Iowa State Veterinarian Dr. Jeff Kaisand said it appears the infections are coming from migrating wild birds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says 17 states have had outbreaks in commercial or private outdoor flocks this year. The virus has been found in wild birds in at least 25 states. With the addition of the new Iowa cases, the U.S. poultry industry has had to kill more than 15.6 million chickens and 1.3 million turkeys since Jan. 1. In Iowa alone, infections have been found in seven commercial flocks and two backyard flocks. Iowa's agriculture secretary, Mike Naig, said the situation could worsen since the spring migration is likely to continue for a few more months. Much depends on the weather and improved biosecurity on farms, he said. Naig said it's too soon to estimate the economic loss this year. 'It's a difficult time for poultry producers, not just those that have an infected site,' he said. Food prices are already high due to inflation and supply chain problems, and if the bird flu outbreak expands to enough farms, chicken, turkey and egg prices could climb higher. Health officials say they don't know of any people who have caught the bird flu in the U.S., and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern. The virus can spread from infected birds to people, but such infections are rare and haven't led to sustained outbreaks among humans. The worst recent bird flu outbreak in the U.S. happened in 2015, when more than 230 farms in 15 states had outbreaks leading to the killing of over 50 million birds. The total economic loss has been valued at $3.3 billion, according to research published in 2019 by a group of Iowa State University scientists. In 2015, cases didn't surface in Iowa until mid-April.

{"id": "97", "title": "Egg Prices Jump as Bird Flu Hits Poultry Flocks; Avian influenza spreading across the U.S. has led to the deaths of more than 17 million birds, tightening supplies for eggs and poultry", "date": "2022-04-02", "fulltext": "A rapidly escalating bird-flu outbreak in the U.S. is contributing to a surge in egg prices and threatens to raise prices on other poultry products in the coming months as deaths continue to mount. Cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza so far have led to the deaths of more than 17 million birds, according to Agriculture Department data. The virus outbreak, the worst in seven years, is hitting Midwest egg-laying flocks and affecting companies from Tyson Foods Inc. to Hormel Foods Corp. More than 11 million egg-laying chickens, roughly 3% of the total U.S. flock, have died or been destroyed as a result of the disease, along with more than two million commercially raised turkeys. Shell egg prices have climbed to $2.88 a dozen, up about 52% since Feb. 8, when the USDA confirmed the first case in a U.S. commercial turkey flock in Indiana. It is their highest point since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, according to market research firm Urner Barry. Prices are being driven higher by the disease's spread and the coming Easter holiday, when demand for eggs is high, analysts said. Industry officials aren't expecting any shortages, but analysts said retailers are buying up eggs in anticipation that supplies could tighten in the coming weeks. \"Egg availability heading into Easter is sure to be hampered,\" said Brian Earnest, an animal protein economist at CoBank. The U.S. supply of table egg-laying chickens is down from more than 340 million in April 2019 to about 322 million in February, he estimated. As a result, companies like Cal-Maine Inc., the largest U.S. egg producer by sales, are poised to see higher egg prices for the rest of the year as a result of the tighter market, said analysts at Stephens Inc. Cal-Maine said Wednesday that it hasn't had any cases at company-owned or contracted production facilities to date. \"We are also working closely with egg industry associations and government officials to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks and effectively manage our response,\" said Dolph Baker, Cal-Maine's chief executive. The price of turkey breasts, already at its highest levels since the last major avian influenza outbreak in 2015, has held around $4.45 a pound over the past few weeks, according to Urner Barry. With turkey supplies already tight and demand likely to grow in the summer months, further flock losses could push prices higher, said Russ Whitman, senior vice president at the firm. Dozens of bird-flu cases have been reported across the U.S. in the past two months, with cases ranging from Maryland to South Dakota. The disease was confirmed by the USDA in five new U.S. states Wednesday. The disease also was confirmed in several commercial turkey farms in Minnesota that supply Hormel's Jennie-O Turkey Store brand, affecting more than 300,000 turkeys, the company said. Perdue Farms Inc. said it received confirmation in late February of bird flu in two of its Indiana turkey flocks. Tyson said there was an outbreak in a flock of about 240,000 birds at a commercial farm in Fulton County, Ky., that housed the company's chickens. The bird-flu outbreak comes as food prices are already on the rise, with food makers paying more for fuel, ingredients and labor. Analysts said it can be difficult to pinpoint how much prices of certain protein products have been affected by the bird flu because of other inflationary pressures. The war between two grain-producing powers, Russia and Ukraine, is further inflating meat prices as producers rely heavily on grain to feed livestock and poultry. The U.S. poultry industry had remained largely unaffected by avian influenza since the 2015 outbreak that led to the deaths of more than 50 million chickens and turkeys, the largest ever recorded in the U.S. Since then, chicken, turkey and egg processors invested in new biosecurity measures and other precautions. Officials said the increased measures give them confidence they can mitigate the spread, but this year's outbreak has been hard to predict. The USDA has been working with the poultry industry and individual states on surveillance and communicating proper farm safety measures since then, said Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer at the USDA. The department said it compensates farm owners for fair market value of any animals euthanized and other costs associated with controlling the virus. Safety measures include not sharing equipment between farms and keeping it disinfected, and workers showering and donning clean clothing and boots before interacting with a flock, she said. Farmers also need to secure their barns from wild birds that could be carrying the virus: A breakthrough at a commercial farm could be as simple as a worker stepping on wild bird fecal matter outside of the barn and forgetting to clean their boots before entering, experts said. Trey Braswell, a fourth-generation farmer in Nashville, N.C., said he has limited visitors to his farm, disinfects all vehicles and requires any outside vehicles coming in to go through a carwash. His 1.7 million layer chickens haven't been affected so far. \"There is no foolproof system,\" he said. \"Egg farmers are working around the clock.\" Farmers, industry groups and the USDA have held weekly calls about managing the bird flu's impact, said Emily Metz, CEO of the American Egg Board, which represents egg producers.

{"id": "98", "title": "Avian flu strain reaches Wyoming, poultry producers warned", "date": "2022-04-02", "fulltext": "CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — A strain of avian flu has made its way to Wyoming, and poultry producers of all sizes are being warned to keep a close eye on their flocks. As of Thursday, the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, had been confirmed in two Wyoming counties. HPAI is a highly contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys and other birds, and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death in infected birds,” the Wyoming Livestock Board said in recent news releases. The virus was identified in birds from Johnson County, the state Livestock Board said Wednesday, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS. On Thursday, the Livestock Board said the virus had also been identified in Park County birds. Recent HPAI detections don’t present an immediate public health concern, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and no human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S., the news releases said. Both samples were from birds the news release said had been part of a non-commercial backyard mixed-species flock (non-poultry). They were initially tested by the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and were confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa. The Livestock Board said its officials had quarantined the areas where both flocks lived, and that the birds would be destroyed to prevent further spread. It also said it was working closely with USDA APHIS on a joint incident response, including additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The Livestock Board offered assurances that birds and eggs from the infected flocks would not enter the food system. Still, it issued a reminder that all poultry and eggs should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit as a general food safety precaution. More information can be found on the APHIS website. For more information specific to Wyoming, contact the Livestock Board at 307-777-7515, or visit its website at wlsb.state.wy.us/public. Following Thursday’s news release, the Livestock Board said, information about any additional confirmed cases would be shared directly with local communities and announced on its website. Prevention and monitoring Wyoming State Veterinarian Dr. Hallie Hasel told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle on Thursday that the avian flu hasn’t been seen in the state for several years. However, the U.S. has seen rapid spread in 2022, and it’s very difficult to predict when the virus might show up and how prevalent it may be, Hasel said. Anyone involved in poultry production, from the small backyard chicken owner to the large commercial producer, should review their biosecurity activities, or measures taken to prevent disease, the state Livestock Board said. Because avian flu is spread by migratory birds, the best way to prevent its spread is to keep poultry in a chicken coop or other structure away from wild birds, as well as from standing water, Hasel said. An ordinance allowing the keeping of backyard chickens within the city limits was passed by the Cheyenne City Council in April 2016. It is unclear how common the practice is currently. Hasel said that, because of the risk of spread between flocks, those who keep poultry should not visit other places where these birds are kept until the virus has stopped spreading. That will happen over the next couple months as we progress from spring into summer, Hasel said. The migration, of course, slows down, and so the spread of the virus will decrease significantly as the migratory birds have reached their destination. Birds should be monitored for symptoms of HPAI, including: coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite; decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; lack of coordination; and diarrhea. Even if birds aren’t showing symptoms, avian flu can cause sudden death, the Livestock Board said. Anyone who sees these symptoms should immediately contact their veterinarian. Those without a regular vet should call the Livestock Board at 307-777-8270 or 307-777-6440. Sick birds or unusual bird deaths can also be reported through APHIS at 866-536-7593.", "media_outlet": "AP", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "99", "title": "What to Know About the Bird Flu Outbreak", "date": "2022-04-02", "fulltext": "A highly pathogenic form of the avian flu has been detected in 29 states. Millions of chickens and turkeys from infected commercial and backyard flocks have been killed. From Wyoming to Maine, an outbreak of the highly contagious bird flu has swept across farms and backyard flocks in the United States this year, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled. Iowa has been particularly hard hit, with disasters being declared in some counties and the state canceling live bird exhibits in an order that may affect its famed state fair. Here is what we know about the bird flu. What is avian influenza? Better known as the bird flu, avian influenza is a highly contagious and deadly virus that can prey on chickens, turkeys and wild birds, including ducks, geese and eagles. It spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it difficult to contain. Symptoms of the virus include a sudden increase in the mortality of a flock, a drop in egg production and diminished consumption of feed and water. The virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry. Its prevalence in the United States is not unexpected, with outbreaks previously reported in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Should humans be worried about being infected? The risk to humans is very low, said Ron Kean, a faculty associate and extension specialist in the University of Wisconsin at Madison department of animal and dairy sciences. 'It's not impossible for humans to get this virus, but it's been pretty rare,' Professor Kean said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had been monitoring people in the United States who were exposed to infected poultry and other birds. So far, no cases of H5N1 infection have been found among them, the C.D.C. said. Is it safe to eat poultry and eggs? Yes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has said that properly prepared and cooked poultry and eggs should not pose a risk to consumers. The chance of infected poultry entering the food chain is 'extremely low,' the agency has said. Under federal guidelines, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, part of the U.S.D.A., is responsible for inspecting all poultry sold in interstate and foreign commerce. Inspectors are required to be present at all times during the slaughtering process, according to the service, which noted that the inspectors have unfettered access to those facilities. Egg-production facilities that are subject to federal regulation are required to undergo daily inspections once per shift, according to the inspection service. State inspection programs, which inspect poultry products sold only within the state they were produced, are additionally monitored by the U.S.D.A. Because of the mandated culling of infected flocks, experts say, the virus is primarily an animal health issue at this time. Still, the U.S.D.A. recommends cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit to reduce the potential for food-borne illness. Can I expect to pay more for poultry products? Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015. Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'at record high levels,' according to an April 22 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A. If infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs. Prices for white and dark chicken meat were also rising, according to the U.S.D.A. Experts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile. How is the virus detected? Testing for the avian flu typically involves swabbing the mouths and tracheal area of chickens and turkeys. The samples are sent to diagnostic labs to be analyzed. Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states. As of April 20, the highly pathogenic form of the avian flu had been detected in 29 states, a tracking page maintained by the U.S.D.A. showed. The combined number of birds in the infected flocks — the commercial and backyard type — totaled more than 33 million, according to the agency. A spokesman for the U.S.D.A. confirmed that those birds would be required to be euthanized to prevent the spread of the virus. Two commercial egg production facilities in Iowa, one in Buena Vista County and another in Osceola County, constituted the largest infected flocks. Each was made up of more than 5 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said. A producer of eggs in Jefferson County, Wis., was the third-largest infected flock, with more than 2.7 million chickens. The outbreak has taken an unusual toll on raptors or birds of prey, including more than three dozen bald eagles. Because spring is nesting season, some experts are worried that avian flu may pose a serious threat to the birds' potential offspring. In April, two cases of bird flu were confirmed in zoos in the United States, the Agriculture Department told The Associated Press, though a spokesman declined to give details or identify the zoos. Officials said they would not order the widespread euthanasia of zoo birds as they have on farms. Zoos in the United States began moving birds indoors, away from people and wildlife, to protect them from the bird flu. How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones? The outbreak in 2014 and 2015 in the United States was blamed for $3 billion in losses to the agricultural sector and was considered to be the most destructive in the nation's history. Nearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota. The footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns. 'I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. What can be done to stop the spread of the virus? As early as last year, the U.S.D.A. warned of the likelihood of an outbreak of the avian flu and emphasized a hardening of 'biosecurity' measures to protect flocks of chickens and turkeys. Biosecurity measures include limiting access to the flocks and requiring farm workers to practice strict hygiene measures like wearing disposable boots and coveralls. Sharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus. So can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting. 'Whether that's limiting access where we source feed and water, even truck routes, how do we try to limit those connections that might spread pathogens between flocks are all really important,' Dr. Bowman said. 'At this point, every person producing poultry has to be considering how to improve their biosecurity.' Experts at the University of Minnesota have also recommended that people stop using outdoor bird feeders and bird baths for a few months, until the rate of transmission decreases, to discourage birds from gathering. 'Not only will this action help to protect those beautiful feathered creatures that visit your yard, but will also help all wild bird species that are already having it hard this spring because of the outbreak,' Dr. Victoria Hall, executive director of the Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota, said in a statement. Hummingbird feeders, which present a much lower risk, may be used but should be cleaned daily, the Raptor Center said. Is it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys? Infected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A. The virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks. Methods include spraying chickens and turkeys with a foam that causes asphyxiation. In other cases, carbon dioxide is used to kill the birds, whose carcasses are often composted or placed in a landfill. 'It's arguably more humane than letting them die from the virus,' Professor Kean said. Isabella Grullón Paz contributed reporting.

{"id": "102", "title": "Iowa egg, turkey farms to lose 5 million birds to bird flu", "date": "2022-04-05", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Bird flu has infected two more farms in Iowa, forcing the killing of 5.3 million hens and 88,000 turkeys, officials said Friday. The new cases mean that across the nation, farmers have had to kill about 22 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens but also including 1.8 million broiler chickens, 1.9 million pullet and other commercial chickens, and 1.9 million turkeys. Iowa accounts for many of those cases, with operations having to kill about 13 million chickens and 305,000 turkeys since the outbreaks began a month ago. Iowa is the nation’s leading egg producer and had 46 million chickens on farms in February, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Iowa raises about 11.7 million turkeys annually. The latest cases were at an egg farm in Osceola County and a turkey farm in Cherokee County, both in northwest Iowa. Earlier this week, state officials also confirmed the virus on a turkey farm with 35,500 birds in Buena Vista County. Because the virus is so infectious and deadly for commercial poultry, entire flocks are destroyed and composted on the farms when they are infected. USDA data shows 23 states have confirmed cases in commercial or backyard flocks. Spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings or nasal discharge of infected wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which can contaminate dust and soil. Infected wild birds have been found in at least 26 states, and the virus has been circulating in migrating waterfowl in Europe and Asia for nearly a year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cases in birds do not present an immediate public health concern.
