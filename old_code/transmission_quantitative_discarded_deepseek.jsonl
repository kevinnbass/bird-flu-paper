{"id": "3", "fulltext": "Welcome to our monthly roundup of the biggest issues in farming and food production, with must-read reports from around the web Investigating live animal exports All this week we will be reporting on the global trade in live farm animals, which despite welfare and disease concerns, has quadrupled in size over the past 50 years. Nearly 2 billion animals a year are now trucked and shipped around the world on journeys that can take weeks. We'll be exploring why this trade continues, the risk it poses to disease spread and why the EU has become such a key player. We started the series reporting on hundreds of thousands of unwanted male dairy calves due to be born in Ireland this year, where the choice may be between live export or disposing on-farm. We've also reported on the huge revenues generated by the industry, with the Middle East a key market. In 1988, the global trade in all live animals was worth $716m (£48m); by 2017 that had risen to $21bn. In 2016, Saudi Arabia alone imported almost $1bn worth of live animals, mostly sheep. If you have some expertise in this field and would like to contribute to our investigation, please get in touch via animalsfarmed@theguardian.com. News from around the world More than 800 million animals are estimated to have been killed in Australian bushfires, which have burned 10 million hectares (40,000 square miles) of land in the country. The Australian government expects that 100,000 cattle and sheep could be lost as a result of the bushfires. At least 13,120 farm animals have been euthanised or confirmed dead as a result of bushfires in New South Wales. An outbreak of the highly contagious H5N8 bird flu has been rapidly spreading across eastern Europe this month. Outbreaks have been reported in the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. French authorities culled millions of birds in an attempt to contain the last outbreak of the H5N8 virus in Europe in 2017. In China, an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N6 bird flu has been reported in swans in the western Xinjiang region of the country. A reported 180 sheep rescued from the Queen Hind cargo ship that capsized as they were being transported from Romania to Saudi Arabia are due to be resettled. More than 14,000 sheep onboard the ship died. Animal welfare groups leading the rescue of the sheep opposed sending the surviving animals on to Saudi Arabia for slaughter and are in discussions to gain custody of the sheep and resettle them in animal sanctuaries in Romania. One of Europe's largest meat producers, the Netherlands-based Vion, has said it expects the numbers of pigs and cattle in western Europe to decline by 20% over the next decade. It also expects meat consumption to fall by 1½% a year over the same period. Dutch food safety inspectors still allegedly encounter pigs drowning in hot water having not been properly killed, according to documents obtained by an animal rights group. Campaigners have called for independent camera surveillance on slaughter lines in the Netherlands. In England, all abattoirs are required to have CCTV installed. A farming minister in the German state of Lower Saxony has called for a meat tax to be introduced in the country. Meat in Germany is currently taxed at a reduced rate of 7% instead of 19%. Former environment minister Michael Gove has previously rejected the idea of introducing a meat tax in the UK.

{"id": "4", "fulltext": "HONG KONG Sometimes history seems to unspool in a continuous playback loop. That is the feeling I get from watching Hongkongers donning face masks, dousing hands with sanitizer, and once again bracing for the possibility that a deadly new coronavirus outbreak originating in mainland China will spread here. Chinese authorities' delayed response, the secrecy breeding mistrust, the lack of full transparency, and efforts to control the narrative by downplaying the seriousness it all rings sadly familiar. Public health emergencies should be handled quickly, transparently, and devoid of political considerations. But public health is inherently political and, with anything involving China, politics can never be fully excised. For Chinese Communist officials, particularly at the provincial level, there is an innate tendency to cover up and conceal, their long-imbued penchant for secrecy always taking precedence over trifling concerns like promoting public awareness and advocating proper precautions. That was certainly the case in late 1997, just after China assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong, when the territory was hit by an outbreak of the H5N1 virus known as 'bird flu.' Well into the outbreak, with people sick and some dying, Hong Kong officials were reluctant to finger China as the source, even though 80% of the territory's poultry came from the mainland. Hong Kong ordered the slaughter of more than 1.3 million chickens, ducks, pigeons, and other birds, but officials were still nonsensically hesitant to point to China as the culprit behind the contagion out of fear of contradicting Beijing, which insisted strongly that all its chickens were healthy. Support STAT: STAT is offering coverage of the coronavirus for free. Please consider a subscription to support our journalism. Start free trial today. The same obfuscation and denial came from China's Communist authorities in reaction to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, also caused by a coronavirus, in late 2002 and 2003. Even as the virus spread, Chinese officials continued to undercount cases and delay reporting information to the World Health Organization. The government did not warn the public for months, allowing people carrying the virus to migrate freely, and did not alert the WHO until February 2003. China finally began concerted action in the summer of 2003 and SARS was quickly brought under control. But the inadequate reporting and delayed response led to a public health trust deficit that persists today. Like bird flu in 1997 and the SARS epidemic of 2002 to 2003, the newest coronavirus has originated in the mainland, this time in Wuhan, most likely in a market where exotic wild animals are sold. Like before, there are suspicions that in these early stages the number of confirmed cases were undercounted, underreported, or both. Like before, there were delays and denials, with Wuhan officials initially downplaying the virus as mild, treatable, and contained while dismissing the likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Those who disagreed online were questioned by police for spreading 'false rumors.' But 2020 is not 1997, nor even 2003. China's public health infrastructure and reporting system have become more reliable. Most importantly, internet use and penetration in China today makes it virtually impossible for a cover-up to last for long. Despite censorship of some news about the coronavirus including blocking foreign media websites social media platforms have been filled with debate, discussion, and questions from citizens asking what precautions they should take. State media has also made much of President Xi Jinping's instruction to local officials to open up about the number of cases and the severity of the epidemic or risk consequences. And WHO investigators and Hong Kong specialists have been allowed to visit Wuhan. Does this signal that Beijing is opting for a new policy of transparency this time? 'It's still very mixed,' said my colleague, King-wa Fu, who studies Chinese censorship patterns at the University of Hong Kong. 'We see censorship. But we also see a lot of discussion online. We'll have to wait and see.' The rapid spiral in the number of identified cases of infection with the coronavirus, and the new draconian measures taken, like effectively quarantining Wuhan at the start of the busy Lunar New Year travel period, breeds suspicion that the real picture may be far worse than officials even now admit. Even the quarantine smacks of too little, too late. It seems ill-planned, and likely to be largely ineffective. First there is the near impracticality of sealing off a city of 11 million people, larger than the populations of Hong Kong or New York City. The move was taken the day before the New Year's Eve travel period, when many people would have already started on their journeys. Planes, trains, and buses were halted, but it was unclear what provisions would be made for private cars. Perhaps most inexplicably, the ban was announced to take effect at 10 a.m. on a Thursday, creating an early-morning crush of travelers trying to get out ahead of the quarantine. Then there's the matter of whether such a closure of Wuhan could even be effective. Some public health experts I spoke with said there seems to have been no provision made for getting food, fuel, and critical supplies like medicine into the city, or how investigators, decision-makers, or even journalists would enter and whether they would then be permitted to leave. And while the closure might temporarily tamp down the geographical spread of the coronavirus apart from those residents who have already left it could also have the unintended effect of turning Wuhan into an incubator of infection. The Hong Kong government was already facing a loss of public confidence after months of protests sparked by Chief Executive Carrie Lam's botched extradition bill. Some pro-democracy lawmakers and ordinary citizens are accusing the government of dragging its feet on the virus crisis for fear of offending Beijing for example, not shutting down the West Kowloon rail terminus, and not immediately demanding arriving mainland train passengers fill out health declaration forms. Bird flu redux. For the Chinese Communist Party, which just celebrated 70 years in power, its legitimacy derives not from any election but from its performance. China's leaders base their right to rule on how effectively they have managed what is soon to be the world's largest economy. One may have thought China's leaders had learned from their errors handling SARS. Unfortunately, history teaches us otherwise, and seems to be repeating itself again. Keith B.

{"id": "5", "fulltext": "HONG KONG—Chinese authorities announced Saturday a recurrence of avian influenza in chickens in central China, adding fresh economic concerns for a country reeling from an outbreak of coronavirus that has sickened nearly 12,000 people since it emerged in December. In a sign of the pressure already on China, Australia and Vietnam joined the U.S. and others in distancing their citizens from the country over the coronavirus, while Apple Inc. shut its stores on the Chinese mainland and Beijing pledged more support for embattled businesses. The Latest on the Coronavirus * Australia orders its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days * Vietnam halts all flights to and from Taiwan and China * Apple closes all of its retail stores in mainland China until Feb. 9 * Beijing pledges more support for its economy * Avian influenza adds to concerns about economy The avian influenza is likely to add to the economic damage rather than pose a major immediate health risk. China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that a case of H5N1 avian influenza, last identified in China in April last year, had killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. But while avian influenza can be fatal in humans, with a mortality rate of 60%, according to the World Health Organization, it doesn't spread easily to humans. In addition to the coronavirus, China has been grappling with an outbreak of African swine fever that has decimated the country's pig population over the past two years. Pork is China's main source of protein, and swine fever last year pushed overall consumer inflation to the highest level in eight years. Hunan province, where the avian influenza outbreak announced on Saturday took place, neighbors Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Australia said that it would impose new entry restrictions in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, banning foreign nationals who have been in mainland China in the past 14 days from entering Australia, while Qantas Airways Ltd., the country's national carrier, said it would suspend flights to the mainland starting Feb. 9. Vietnam's civil aviation authority said it would halt all flights to and from Taiwan and China, including the special Chinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong, starting Saturday. Several countries and airlines have suspended flights to China, including Pakistan, Italy and the U.S.'s American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. The move by Australia, which also ordered its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days, to tighten entry restrictions followed a U.S. tightening. A day earlier, the U.S. said it would deny entry to foreign nationals who had traveled anywhere in China within the past 14 days and imposed quarantines on Americans returning from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. The coronavirus has killed 259 people and infected nearly 12,000 in China as of late Friday, according to the official National Health Commission in Beijing. The number of infected patients in China alone now exceeds the global total for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed nearly 800 people after emerging from southern China in 2002 and 2003. Authorities in Beijing pledged more support for the economy in a bid to reassure investors before markets reopen on Monday. Companies and industries in regions hit particularly hard by the outbreak, including those that provide medical supplies, could get reduced lending rates, the central bank said in a joint statement with other government agencies, including the Finance Ministry and the banking regulator. China's cabinet said separately that products imported from the U.S. to control the outbreak will be exempt from punitive tariffs through March 31. Authorities also exempted tariffs and other taxes on products donated by overseas entities, according to a joint statement by the Finance Ministry and the customs agency. Resources are strained in Hubei province, and medical staff have been forced to turn away patients because of a lack of beds and basic medical supplies. Local authorities in Huanggang, a city about 35 miles east of Wuhan, imposed new restrictions on residents' movements, saying only one person per household in the city center would be allowed to go out every two days to purchase basic necessities. Apple is closing all of its retail stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb. 9 'out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts,' it said. The company operates more than 40 stores in China. North Korea said through its state media that it would send an aid fund to Chinese authorities, a rare extension of aid from Pyongyang. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, 'expressed deep consolation for the families who lost their blood relatives due to the infectious disease,' according to a report in Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency. North Korea—a close ally of China that has long been dependent on China's largess—was among the first countries to adopt stringent measures to keep the coronavirus outside its borders, and vowed to redouble its efforts. 'The novel coronavirus throws the world into uneasiness and horror, but the advantages and might of our state system—will be fully demonstrated to the whole world once again, when we ensure that the virus does not reach our country and that no one suffers from the infections,' it read.

{"id": "6", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — An infectious and fatal strain of bird flu has been confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in South Carolina, the first case of the more serious strain of the disease in the United States since 2017 and a worrisome development for an industry that was devastated by previous outbreaks. The high pathogenic case was found at an operation in Chesterfield County, South Carolina, marking the first case of the more dangerous strain since one found in a Tennessee chicken flock in 2017. In 2015, an estimated 50 million poultry had to be killed at operations mainly in the Upper Midwest after infections spread throughout the region. “Yes, it’s concerning when we see cases, but we are prepared to respond very quickly and that was done in this case,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The USDA has been working in recent months with scientists and farmers in North Carolina and South Carolina, where a low pathogenic — or less severe — strain of bird flu had been detected. Low pathogenic bird flu causes few clinical signs in infected birds. However, two strains of low pathogenic bird flu — the H5 and H7 strains — can mutate into highly pathogenic forms, which are frequently fatal to birds and easily transmissible between susceptible species. Low pathogenic cases were already in an area near the South Carolina and North Carolina state line and USDA was closely monitoring and testing. The case in Chesterfield County, South Carolina was expected to be another low pathogenic case, but it came back from the laboratory high pathogenic which means the less severe virus mutated into the more severe version, Cole said. “Our scientists at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory had looked at the virus characteristics of the low path virus and they had previously indicated that this was one that was probably likely to mutate so they were watching it very closely,” Cole said. A laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the virus that had been killing turkeys was a high pathogenic H7N3 strain of avian influenza. A report on the outbreak indicates it was discovered on April 6. It has killed 1,583 turkeys and the remainder of the 32,577 birds in the flock were euthanized. State officials quarantined the farm, movement controls were implemented and enhanced surveillance was already in place in the area. “The flock was quickly depopulated and will not enter the marketplace,” said Joel Brandenberger, president of the National Turkey Federation, an industry trade group. “Thorough disinfecting and cleaning procedures have already been initiated on premises as well as surveillance of commercial flocks in the surrounding area. This occurrence poses no threat to public health. Turkey products remain safe and nutritious.” He said poultry farmers implement strict biosecurity measures year-round and routinely test flocks for avian influenza. These measures were implemented after an H5N2 avian influenza outbreak that began in December 2014 swept commercial chicken, egg laying and turkey populations throughout much of 2015 killing 50 million birds and causing as much as $3 billion in economic damage. That outbreak is believed to have originated in wild birds. Nearly 90 percent of the bird losses were on egg-laying chicken farms in Iowa and turkey farms in Minnesota. The bulk of other cases occurred in the adjacent states of Nebraska, Wisconsin, and South Dakota. Cole said since 2015 significant planning, exercises and coordination has occurred between the federal government, state agencies and the industry. Cole said the coronavirus pandemic has not affected the ability of the government to respond to the bird flu. A highly pathogenic H7N9 bird flu strain was detected in Lincoln County, Tennessee, in a chicken flock of 73,500 birds in early March 2017. Ten days later samples from a commercial flock less than two miles away also tested positive for the same strain. The birds were euthanized and buried and the virus didn’t spread further indicating immediate mitigation action can stop spread.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 6}, {"key": "affirm_evolve_statement_3", "statement": "Our scientists at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory had looked at the virus characteristics of the low path virus and they had previously indicated that this was one that was probably likely to mutate so they were watching it very closely."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 4}, {"key": "deny_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "This occurrence poses no threat to public health.

{"id": "7", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Here's a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds. There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called 'Influenza A (H5N1),' or the 'H5N1 virus.' Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu. The mortality rate is close to 60% for infected humans. Timeline Early 1900s -The avian flu is first identified in Italy. 1961 - The H5N1 strain is isolated in birds in South Africa.

{"id": "8", "fulltext": "Greg Langmo's decades-old business was among those hit when a lethal strain decimated poultry barns across America. In April 2015, Greg Langmo's five turkey farms teemed with toms, hens and chicks. His family's decades-old business in Meeker county, Minnesota, was thriving, and the hundreds of thousands of birds he bred and sold each year were healthy. And then, late one evening, Langmo's phone rang. Birds in one of his barns, usually active, were sitting, unable to make the short walk to their feeders and waterers. The following morning, he found hundreds of limp, white-feathered bodies. Langmo sent some dead toms to the University of Minnesota's veterinary diagnostic laboratory. That night, the farmer lay sleepless. Again, his phone rang. It was a vet from the lab: 'You got it.' Langmo's farms had been hit by the Eurasian/North American H5N2 strain of lethal avian influenza, which, along with another lethal strain, Eurasian H5N8, rampaged across poultry farms in the American west and midwest between December 2014 and June 2015. A third strain, Eurasian/North American H5N1, was detected in nearly 100 wild birds by US wildlife biologists. It was the first time a foreign strain of bird flu H5N8 had entered North America and mixed with mild bird flu viruses. It's one of many lethal bird flu outbreaks to kill billions of birds and cost billions of dollars over the past hundred years. Such losses are part of the reality of farming today. Lethal avian influenza's advent is strongly linked to the development of modern agriculture, which created a global network of disease incubators—industrial farms in some parts of the world, live animal markets in others—linked by trading routes, movement of labourers and equipment, and migration of wild birds. Critical diagnosis Soon after the diagnosis, says Langmo, 'the rest of the birds began dying by the bushel.' To stop the spread, Langmo and his employees killed survivors with a swift crack to the back of the head. Within three days, virtually all 11,000 toms in the infected barn were dead. Then they moved into the other barns. Workers from the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) arrived and doused any live birds with water-based foam, an asphyxiant used to mass-euthanise poultry in emergencies only. Foam flowed across the floors, bubbling like a choppy sea, the turkeys beneath it gasping for air. Fifteen minutes later, all were dead. Only other poultry farmers will know the helpless feeling of losing a great flock of birds, Greg Langmo reflected. He lost 225,000 turkeys across five farms. Langmo was one of 211 American commercial poultry farmers who battled bird flu during the 2014-15 outbreak, the worst the $40bn (£1bn) US poultry industry has experienced. Twenty-one flocks on backyard farms were diagnosed and destroyed. Nationwide, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys died from the virus or were killed to control it. American commercial poultry farmers lost about $1.6bn. The US poultry industry lost an estimated $3.3bn. 'This outbreak was arguably the most significant animal health event in US history,' says Dr Julie Gauthier, assistant director for poultry health at USDA-APHIS. Deadly history Lethal bird flu, originally 'fowl plague,' was first diagnosed on Italian farms in 1878. While poultry die-offs reported before 1878 may have been bird flu, this was the first time scientists distinguished the virus from bacterial poultry diseases, such as fowl cholera. Subsequent research revealed that bird flu is an influenza-A virus. These viruses are rarely lethal and often mildly afflict their natural hosts. But lethal influenza-A viruses, which mutate in and emerge from the bodies of domesticated animals, are known to infect and kill not just poultry, but birds, horses, swine, bats, dogs and even humans. The emergence and coexistence of three hybrid lethal bird flu strains—H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8—in the US during the 2014-2015 pandemic underscores the ability of influenza-A viruses to rapidly mix, transform, infect and persist. Lethal bird flu viruses have emerged more frequently as poultry farms have expanded capacities and quickened animal-rearing rates over the past 50 years. In the 37 years from 1959 to 1995, these viruses emerged 14 times globally, about one outbreak every 2.6 years; while in the 13 years from 1996 to 2008, they arose 11 times, about one outbreak every 1.2 years. These species don't mix Scientists and farmers are divided over the best way forward. In terms of prevention, should birds be kept inside, which would reduce potential contact with wild birds? Should large-scale movement of animals (industrial farming depends on the transportation of large populations of birds after breeding and for slaughter) be scaled down? That is one of the key vectors by which the disease may be spread. Some regions of the world look to good farm hygiene and high levels of biosecurity, where infected birds are confined and killed to eradicate disease; others, particularly in countries with many outdoor industrial farms, struggle with implementing biosecurity and may lack available veterinary care, so they allow diseases to circulate, using vaccines to reduce illness and mortality. 'Vaccines do not prevent birds from becoming infected with the avian influenza virus or from producing and shedding the virus into the environment,' says Gauthier, adding that up until now culling birds was the preferred solution in the US. Constant threat Gene Baur, president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary, a UK-based animal protection organisation, believes that establishing a network of small farms serving local communities is one powerful possibility, because it reduces the need for transporting animals, farm labourers and equipment. Scientists are recognising the benefits of giving birds more space—research shows chickens stressed by overcrowded living conditions typical to commercial farms have diminished immunity to disease. After a major avian influenza outbreak in Thailand from 2004 to 2005, experts determined that industrial farms were more likely to be infected than backyard farms. In the Netherlands, after a 2003 outbreak, scientists suggested that thinning commercial flocks could prevent the next epidemic. When you confine animals in these filthy conditions they become breeding grounds for disease, Gene Baur, Farm Sanctuary, says. 'When you confine animals in these filthy, crowded, stressful conditions, just like humans, they become breeding grounds for disease,' says Baur. After considering his financial losses from the 2014-2015 pandemic, Langmo spent a year rebuilding his business, downsizing from five farms to two. He says he's boosted biosecurity by cutting cross-traffic, checking birds' health more frequently and improving sanitation with routine deep-cleanings. 'After a thorough sanitisation, each barn literally needs to be as clean as your kitchen, no feathers, no nothing,' says Langmo. 'It's very expensive.'

{"id": "11", "fulltext": "Farmers found to be breaching new biosecurity rules face unlimited fines or three month prison sentence Poultry keepers across England, Scotland and Wales are facing tough new lockdown-style measures on their farms to control the spread of bird flu. It follows outbreaks of a highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of bird flu in Cheshire, Devon, Gloucestershire and Hertfordshire over the past two weeks. The outbreaks have been found in wild bird populations and two broiler chicken farms, where all the birds are being culled. Farmers are required to restrict access for non-essential people, remove sources of wild bird food and ensure workers are regularly disinfecting footwear and changing clothes. Those found to not be complying face up to three months in prison or unlimited fines, according to the measures announced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). UK and European farmers have been on alert after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. When bird flu was detected in the same area of Russia in the summers of 2005 and 2016, epidemics followed in northern and eastern Europe. However, the speed of the spread of outbreaks in Europe over the past few weeks has caught the industry by surprise, with hundreds of thousands of birds culled after multiple outbreaks across Germany and the Netherlands. Thousands of dead wild birds were also reportedly found on the north-west coast of Germany last week, most likely infected with bird flu. British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said bird flu was a significant threat to the commercial poultry industry and he supported new restrictive measures to minimise the risk of a larger and wider outbreak. It is an incredibly difficult situation for farmers and producers if they get a case of avian influenza (AI), so the controls and their costs are made to be as fair as they can be. For instance, farmers are compensated for the culling of healthy birds as part of AI controls. The system is as fair as it possibly can be, given the nature of the situation. During the last significant bird flu outbreak in 2016/17, there was also a ban on keeping poultry outdoors. Defra said this was not being considered at present, but would be if the outbreak spread further. Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and that properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. PHE said: Our advice regarding contact with wild birds remains the same make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after coming into contact with any animal and do not touch any sick or dead birds.

{"id": "12", "fulltext": "Virus causing high levels of mortality in birds, with risk to chickens and other poultry A spate of baffling swan deaths is strongly suspected to be caused by a virulent new strain of avian flu sweeping across Britain. Dying swans were found spinning in circles and discharging blood from their nostrils on Ulverston canal, Cumbria. Swan rescuers have taken in more than 25 dying birds in Worcestershire and nine swans were found dead in Stanley Park, Blackpool. Postmortem examinations have confirmed that six black swans and cygnets that died in Dawlish, Devon, had contracted the latest strain of bird flu, H5N8. Brought in by wild birds migrating across Europe, the strain last caused widespread avian deaths in the winter of 2016-17. The risk to human health from the virus is very low, according to Public Health England. Fears are growing that the virus will wipe out chickens and other poultry this winter, with outbreaks already confirmed among captive birds in Kent, Cheshire, Leicestershire, and chickens at a broiler breeding farm in Herefordshire. The government has declared an avian influenza prevention zone across England, Scotland and Wales, requiring all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures. While the virus is particularly visible in swans and large wildfowl, other wild bird deaths confirmed this month include pink-footed geese, greylag geese, Canada geese, buzzards and curlews. Dr Ruth Cromie, a research fellow at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, said: 'Wild birds are often seen as evil vectors, but they are victims of a virus which originally spread from poultry. Wild birds get used as scapegoats for poor biosecurity and people moving chickens around the globe.' She said avian flu, like all influenza viruses, regularly mutates, and there are either genetic or environmental factors making it particularly pathogenic this year. The virus disrupts the nervous system and can cause neurological symptoms in birds, such as head-twitching, stumbling and swimming in circles. Cromie added: 'We can be sure it is causing high levels of mortality this year.' Caroline Sim, of Flying Free, a volunteer operation to protect and rescue swans in Ulverston, said she had never seen such strange symptoms in the family of 10 swans there that died of bird flu. 'Many of them started to spin on their axis in one direction. It was terrible to see. Some of them were discharging from their nostrils and some of it was bloody,' she said. The dead birds were collected by officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to be tested. David Cash, of Worcester Swan Rescue, said about 25 swans had died. 'The swans were looking lethargic and not wanting food, and doing a lot of coughing – similar to the symptoms of Covid.' The government's prevention zone obliges all bird keepers to take measures to discourage mixing between captive and wild birds, such as feeding and watering their birds in enclosed areas, and removing wild bird food sources from around captive birds. Experts noticed an unusually high level of avian flu in Russia during the summer, and this has been spread across Europe by wild species, such as swans and geese, during their westward migration for the winter. Christine Middlemiss, the UK chief veterinary officer, repeated the Food Standards Agency advice that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for consumers. She added: 'Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to meet enhanced biosecurity requirements and this is in your interests to do, to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.' Cromie said that while improving biosecurity was the best short-term solution, the authorities should be looking at how these viruses originate in and are amplified by industrial meat production. Britain slaughters more than 1 billion chickens every year. She said: 'We should not be looking to put every chicken in a house, but asking: do we really need to have that many chickens? We're creating these nutty industrialised production systems that create a variety of health problems.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 7}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 7}]}

Millions of free-range hens and other birds will have to be kept indoors from 14 December, in a national government crackdown to try to limit the spread of a virulent strain of avian flu across Great Britain. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a statement that the chief vets of England, Scotland and Wales had agreed the new legal requirement for all birdkeepers to bring their flocks indoors, to keep them separate from potentially infectious wild birds. The strict new lockdown-style measures, which have already been introduced in the Netherlands, apply not only to large commercial poultry farms but also smaller keepers with hens in coops or garden pens. Keepers are being urged to use the next 11 days to prepare for the new measures, including taking steps to safeguard animal welfare, consult their vet and where necessary erect additional housing or self-contained netted areas. Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as free-range for 16 weeks after the birds have been brought indoors, but if the restrictions last beyond that they must be downgraded to barn produced using stickers on packaging. Similarly, poultry meat can be labelled free-range for 12 weeks. To be defined as free range in the UK, a chicken must normally be at least 56 days old before slaughter and have had access to outside space for at least half that time. Premium free-range eggs currently represent 56% of UK retail egg sales – the highest proportion of any European country – whereas just 2% of eggs are from the barn system. Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser with the National Farmers' Union, urged all farmers to comply with the new rules. Due to a number of confirmed avian influenza cases, the introduction of these new housing measures is a logical next step to best protect poultry. These new measures mean that every poultry keeper, whether you have one hen in the garden or a large poultry business, must house their birds indoors and I would urge everyone with poultry to take these measures seriously. It's crucial that everyone remains vigilant and reports any signs of disease in their birds at the earliest opportunity. On Sunday, all 10,500 turkeys at a farm in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, were culled after an outbreak was spotted on Saturday, while a 3km (2-mile) and 10km temporary control zone was put in place to stop the disease spreading. About 13,500 birds were culled earlier this month following confirmation of an avian flu outbreak at a commercial farm in Helsby, near Frodsham in Cheshire. Defra reiterated that the risk to human health and food safety from the virus was very low. UK and European farmers have been on alert after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. In a joint statement, Great Britain's three chief vets said: We have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease and are now planning to introduce a legal requirement for bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds. We have not taken this decision lightly, but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease. A spokesman for the British Egg Industry Council said: To date there have been no cases of avian flu in free-range laying flocks; however it is vital that we continue to protect the health and welfare of the UK's laying flock and commercial poultry operations. The requirement to keep birds inside from 14 December is a further step to those already taken to continue to protect flocks. It is the first time in four years that a so-called housing order has been imposed on the UK poultry sector due to a significant outbreak of bird flu, when measures were put in place from December 2016 to May 2017.

Lockdown and the shift towards 'self-sufficiency' has triggered a huge surge in interest by individuals in keeping birds and there is concern that many may have scant regard or understanding of the importance of biosecurity measures. The restrictions will apply to chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants. No end date for the measures has yet been given, and Defra said they would be kept under 'regular review.' Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as 'free-range' for 16 weeks from today, but if restrictions last longer they must be downgraded to 'barn produced' using stickers on packaging.

He said the infected birds were culled and authorities have carried out medical examinations of people who were in contact with them. The virus, which is mainly spread through contact with infected animals, can cause severe illness or death in humans. Egypt suffered a major outbreak of bird flu in 2006 that led to the suspension of all poultry exports.

The country's Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying issued an alert on Wednesday, urging states to take measures to avoid any further spread of the disease. The southern state of Kerala ordered the culling of more than 38,000 poultry birds on Tuesday after reports of dead birds infected with the disease emerged in two districts, according to the state's Minister for Animal Husbandry, K. Raju. \"Nineteen rapid response teams have been formed for this,\" Raju said. About 17,000 birds have been culled in Kerala so far, and eggs have also been destroyed in some districts. The northern state of Himachal Pradesh reported the death of more than 3,000 birds from the disease, mostly bar-headed geese at a wildlife sanctuary, according to Archana Sharma, a senior official in the state forest department. \"The birds affected are migratory birds. All we can do is follow the strategy of clearing up the area of contamination. We comb the entire area of the sanctuary and we physically send 10 teams every day who search for any dead birds and dispose of them,\" Sharma said. The alert comes as India continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 10.3 million people in the country, and is about to embark on one of the most ambitious mass vaccination programs ever undertaken. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually only affects birds. There are many different strains, but the most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called Influenza A (H5N1), or the H5N1 virus. In India, the disease spreads mostly through migratory birds entering the country during the winter season. Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. There have been no reports of avian flu transmitting to people in India so far during this outbreak. \"There is no need to panic,\" Minister of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Giriraj Singh, told public service broadcaster Doordarshan on Wednesday. \"We also provide compensation to farmers for the birds that have to be culled.\" Other countries in Asia have also experienced outbreaks of bird flu this winter.

New clusters are constantly emerging,\" the head of France's CIFOQ federation of foie gras producers, Marie-Pierre Pe, told Agence France-Presse. The number of outbreaks in France had now risen to 124, the ministry of agriculture said on Thursday, adding that about 350,000 ducks had been slaughtered since 24 December. Earlier this week the government's chief veterinary officer, Loic Evain, said more than 200,000 ducks had already been slaughtered and that a further 400,000 birds were set to be culled, out of about 35 million reared each year. He described the virus, which is not harmful to humans, as \"very, very contagious.\" Officials in Belgium said on Thursday they had culled three contaminated poultry flocks: one in Menin, in the west of the country, another in Dinant in the south and a third in Dixmude in western Flanders. Belgium's federal food safety agency AFSCA, which has ordered poultry owners to lock up their animals to avoid contamination, said that 20 cases of the virus had been found in wild birds. Herve Dupouy, a French producer who heads the local poultry section of the FNSEA farmers federation in the Landes department, a bastion of the foie gras industry, said \"The situation is out of control.\" He called on the state to cull all poultry flocks in the area and impose a two-month production freeze. \"There's no other solution,\" he said. So far the authorities have been culling all ducks and geese within a three-kilometre radius of an infected flock. Free-range chickens and turkeys within that range have also been slaughtered. CIFOQ said on Thursday that government officials had shared plans to expand the culls over a wider area. The bird flu clusters have been detected on poultry farms and in pet shops in the Landes department and the neighbouring Gers and Pyrenees-Atlantique departments. The head of France's chamber of agriculture, Sebastien Windsor, called on Wednesday for \"radical measures\" to try to restore confidence in export markets such as China which announced this week it was suspending French poultry imports over the virus. Producers of foie gras, a pate made from the livers of force-fed ducks or geese, fear a repeat of the devastation wrought by two previous waves of bird flu in the winters of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. More than 25m ducks were culled in the first outbreak, followed by 4.5m the following year, causing a steep decline in foie gras production. Besides France and Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain and Ireland have also reported bird flu outbreaks since the winter began. Dutch authorities culled 190,000 chickens in November after the discovery of the virus at two farms. Outbreaks have also been reported in India and South Korea. In India, tens of thousands of poultry will be slaughtered after an outbreak of deadly avian influenza was found to have killed scores of birds across the country. At least six Indian states have stepped up efforts this week to contain two strains of bird flu H5N1 and H5N8 after the deaths of thousands of migratory birds, ducks, crows and chickens. South Korea's agriculture ministry said on Thursday that it had so far culled 14.9m poultry since identifying its first farm-linked, highly pathogenic bird flu case in late November.

{"id": "18", "fulltext": "Seven poultry workers found to be infected, but no evidence of transmission between humans A H5N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, among seven workers who were infected at a Russian poultry plant in December. There is no evidence of the strain being transmitted between humans, but Russia has reported the transmission to the World Health Organization. The workers now feel well, and the situation did not develop further according to Dr Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor. She said the workers had been infected during an outbreak of the strain at the plant. Outbreaks of the strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East and north Africa in recent months, but only in poultry. Other strains of bird flu, including H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2, have been transmitted to humans before. The H5N8 strain is deadly for birds, and this marks the first transmission of the strain from animals to humans. While Popova said the strain didn’t appear to be able to spread among humans, only time will tell how soon future mutations will allow it to overcome this barrier. The discovery of this strain gives us all, the whole world, time to prepare for possible mutations and the possibility to react in a timely way and develop test systems and vaccines, she said. The Vector Institute in Siberia said on Saturday that it would start developing human tests and a vaccine against H5N8, according to RIA news agency. Speaking on state TV, Popova said that Russia had reported the developments to the WHO several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results. Most cases of human bird flu infections have been linked to direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered safe. The cases tend to be spread via migrating wild birds, leading producing countries to keep their poultry indoors or segregated from wildlife. Outbreaks of bird flu often lead poultry plants to kill their birds to prevent the virus spreading further, and often prompts other countries to impose trade restrictions. In the UK, five outbreaks of the H5N8 strain in Gloucestershire, Dorset, Devon, Cheshire and Kent were detected in November, leading officials to implement a prevention zone in England, Scotland and Wales. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said that all birds in the affected areas had been culled humanely and control zones introduced.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 8}, {"key": "affirm_keyword_statement_1", "statement": "While Popova said the strain didn’t appear to be able to spread among humans, only time will tell how soon future mutations will allow it to overcome this barrier.

Russia notified WHO of the possible strain. 'If confirmed, this would be the first time H5N8 has infected people,' a WHO Europe spokesperson said in a statement Saturday. The reported cases were workers exposed to bird flocks, according to preliminary information, the statement added. The workers were 'asymptomatic and no onward human to human transmission was reported,' the spokesperson said. Speaking during a televised briefing on Saturday, Anna Popova, the head of Russia's Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing, said that the strain had been detected in seven poultry farm workers in the south of the country, state-run news agency TASS reported. While still not confirmed by the WHO, the Russian health authority has said it is in discussion with national authorities to gather more information and 'assess the public health impact' of the incident.

{"id": "20", "fulltext": "Covid fuels the current virus pandemic, but the world is full of flu viruses waiting in the wings. And they keep changing unpredictably. When a bird flu virus struck a major poultry farm in Russia earlier this year, it was a reminder that the coronavirus causing the pandemic was not the only dangerous virus out there. The authorities quickly tested the birds and moved into high gear, killing 800,000 chickens, disposing of the carcasses and cleaning the farm to stop the potential spread to other chicken farms. But they were also concerned for humans. They tested the birds and sequenced the virus, determining that it was the H5N8 strain of avian flu, highly dangerous to both wild and domestic birds. It is established in Asia and has been increasingly causing deadly outbreaks in birds in Europe. H5N8 viruses have infected some poultry flocks in the United States, but the viruses come from a different though related lineage of virus, distinct from the current H5N8 viruses in Asia and Europe. Flu viruses combine and mutate frequently in unpredictable ways. In the short period from Dec. 25, 2020, to Jan. 14 of this year, more than seven million birds were lost to H5N8 outbreaks in Europe and Asia. Europe alone had 135 outbreaks among poultry and 35 among wild birds. Of course, to put the numbers in context, humans consume about 65 billion chickens each year, and one estimate puts the number of chickens on the globe at any one time at 23 billion. As damaging as H5N8 has been to birds, it had never infected people. Until February. The Russian health authorities also tested about 200 of the people involved in the cleanup of the farm in Astrakhan, using nasal swabs and later blood tests for antibodies. They reported that for the first time, H5N8 had jumped to people. Seven of the workers appeared to have been infected with the virus, although none of them became ill. Only one of those seven cases, however, was confirmed by genetically sequencing the virus. Nonetheless, the potential danger of the new virus and its jump to humans set off alarm bells for Dr. Daniel R. Lucey, a physician and a specialist in pandemics at Georgetown University. He began writing about the Astrakhan event in a blog for other infectious disease experts as soon as it was publicized. He reported that during a television interview, a Russian public health official said the H5N8 virus was likely to evolve into human-to-human transmission. That possibility was frightening. 'The W.H.O. finally put out a report Feb. 26,' he said. But it did not frame the event as particularly alarming because the virus was not causing human disease, and the report judged the risk of human-to-human transmission as low, despite the Russian official's comment. To Dr. Lucey, no one else seemed to be taking the infection of humans with H5N8 as 'of any concern.' He added, 'I think it's of concern.' Other scientists said they were not as worried. Dr. Florian Krammer, a flu researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, said he was more concerned about other avian flu viruses like H5N1 that have already shown themselves to be dangerous to people. Another avian influenza virus, H7N9, infected people for the first time in 2013. There have been more than 1,500 confirmed cases and more than 600 deaths since then. Since 2017 there have been only three confirmed cases and the virus does not jump easily from person to person. It is always possible that any virus can evolve human-to-human transmission, as well as become more dangerous. But H5N8 would have both hurdles to jump. Compared to other viral threats, Dr. Krammer said, 'I'm not worried.' Dr. Richard J. Webby, a flu specialist at the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and director of the W.H.O.'s Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that all of the H5 viruses are of concern because some of them have infected and killed people. But, he said, 'They all have the same sort of binding capacity to human cells, which is limited,' he said. Flu viruses use a slightly different way to attach to cells in birds than to cells in humans and being good at one usually means not being good at the other. Dr. Webby also said that while seven infections would certainly be of concern, only one infection has been confirmed. The tests of the other six involved nasal swabs and blood antibody tests. In people with no symptoms, he said, nasal swabs can simply indicate that they had breathed in virus. That would not mean it had infected them. Blood antibody tests also have a potential for error, he said, and may not be able to distinguish exposure to one flu virus from another. Nor did he see any scientific basis for suggesting that H5N8 is more likely than any other bird flu to evolve human-to-human transmission. But any virus could evolve that ability. Dr. Lucey said that he was heartened to see that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had prepared a candidate vaccine for H5N8 before it had infected humans. Candidate vaccines are simply first steps in planning for potential problems, and have not been through any testing. They exist for many viruses. 'Humans should be routinely tested for the virus, right at the time of the outbreak in birds,' Dr. Lucey said. He favors the protocol followed in Astrakhan, and argues that for any outbreak among birds, public health authorities should test people who are exposed to sick birds with nasopharyngeal swabs and an antibody test, followed by other antibody tests a few weeks later. An upcoming editorial in the journal Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease also takes up the Astrakhan incident and calls for increased monitoring of all H5 viruses.

The 41-year-old man in Jiangsu province, northwest of Shanghai, was hospitalized April 28 and is in stable condition, the National Health Commission said on its website. No human case of H10N3 has been reported elsewhere, the commission said. “This infection is an accidental cross-species transmission,” its statement said. “The risk of large-scale transmission is low.” The news comes amid heightened awareness of the threat of emerging diseases as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to claim lives around the world. But unlike with coronaviruses, there are global influenza surveillance systems that watch for human cases of bird flu, since a strain named H5N1 cropped up in the late 1990s in Hong Kong’s crowded live-poultry markets. Between 2013 and 2017, another bird flu named H7N9 infected more than 1,500 people in China through close contact with infected chickens. With that history, authorities aren’t surprised to see occasional human cases of various bird flu strains and they monitor closely for any signs one is spreading between people.

{"id": "22", "fulltext": "A man in eastern China may be the first confirmed human case of infection with the H10N3 strain of bird flu, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said Tuesday. The 41-year-old man from Jiangsu province, located northwest of Shanghai, was hospitalized April 28 after developing fever and other symptoms. He was diagnosed with the infection on May 28, according to Reuters, but is now stable and ready to be discharged from the hospital. The health commission said the infection was a result of accidental cross-species transmission. The risk of widespread transmission is low, Chinese officials said, and there are no other human cases of H10N3 reported elsewhere in the world. Avian influenza Type A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds and have been found in more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While these viruses don't normally infect humans, birds can shed virus in their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC says. Human infections can occur if enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth. The CDC says two strains of bird flu viruses have been mostly responsible for human infection and mortality: H7N9 and H5N1. Symptoms of avian influenza A virus infections can range from mild to severe and include conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness such as fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches. Symptoms can also be accompanied by nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and severe respiratory illness, according to the CDC. While it's possible for some of these viruses to jump from birds to humans, they so far don't have the capability of transmitting between humans, said Jürgen Richt, a professor at Kansas State University and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases with the National Institutes of Health. Alpha, Beta, Delta: WHO renames COVID-19 variants with Greek letter names to avoid confusion, stigma COVID origins: Biden tells intelligence agencies to step up probe of COVID-19's origins, including theory of Wuhan lab leak 'This is our biggest fear,' said Richt, who also directs the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases for the Department of Homeland Security. 'If they were to transmit human to human, then we would be at a worse situation than COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates.' This is because bird flu strains can be particularly deadly among human populations. According to the World Health Organization, the case-fatality rate of H7N9 is roughly 30%; H5N1 is 60%. It may be unlikely the H10N3 strain can transmit between humans, Richt said, but scientists can't know for sure until they learn its genetic code and conduct epidemiological surveillance to determine if any other contacts were infected. 'The reason for that is that avian influenza viruses spread among avian species using different receptors than mammalian influenza viruses,' he said. 'In order for these viruses to transmit (among humans), the virus needs to adapt. There're several adaptation steps and, so far, this has not happened with avian flu viruses.'

{"id": "23", "fulltext": "The Chinese government announced Tuesday that a man in Jiangsu province, northwest of Shanghai, had become the first person known to have been infected with the H10N3 strain of bird flu. In a statement, China's National Health Commission emphasized that there was no evidence that the strain had the ability to spread among humans, adding that the risk of a significant outbreak was 'very low.' The patient, a 41-year-old man who lives in the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalized April 28 after having fever symptoms, the National Health Commission said. He was diagnosed with H10N3 a month later. Though the man remains under medical supervision, his condition was described as stable and meeting the standards for discharge. It was not clear from the statement how he caught the virus. The news of the H10N3 infection comes amid the devastation of the covid-19 pandemic, which also was first identified in China and is widely thought to have come to humans from bats through some form of zoonotic spread. A different strain of bird flu, known as H7N9, led to the deaths of around 300 people during an outbreak between 2016 and 2017. But varieties of avian influenza are common in China and, due to increased surveillance of the viruses, relatively easy to find in humans. Unlike in H7N9, there is no evidence that H10N3 can spread easily among humans. 'The more we look for novel viruses as a cause of illness among patients the more we are likely to find them,' Gregory Gray, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Duke University, told the South China Morning Post.

China's National Health Commission also said that H10N3 caused less severe illness among birds. Chinese authorities placed all the man's close contacts under medical observation and said the contacts did not display any 'abnormalities.'

A 41-year-old man in China's eastern Jiangsu Province is the first known human to be infected with a strain of bird flu known as H10N3, China's National Health Commission said on Tuesday—a development that experts said merited close monitoring because of an underlying continued risk of pandemic flus. Avian viruses do not typically spread among humans, but they can pose a danger if they mix with a human virus, said Raina MacIntyre, the head of the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Australia.

The W.H.O. said that H10N3 had 'been detected periodically in birds in live bird markets as early as 2002,' but that the virus was unlikely to kill birds or lead to many signs of illness.

The 41-year-old man from Jiangsu province, located northwest of Shanghai, was hospitalized April 28 after developing fever and other symptoms. He was diagnosed with the infection on May 28, according to Reuters, but is now stable and ready to be discharged from the hospital. The health commission said the infection was a result of accidental cross-species transmission. The risk of widespread transmission is low, Chinese officials said, and there are no other human cases of H10N3 reported elsewhere in the world. Avian influenza Type A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds and have been found in more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While these viruses don't normally infect humans, birds can shed virus in their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC says. Human infections can occur if enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth. While it's possible for some of these viruses to jump from birds to humans, they so far don't have the capability of transmitting between humans, said Jürgen Richt, a professor at Kansas State University and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases with the National Institutes of Health. \"This is our biggest fear,\" said Richt, who also directs the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases for the Department of Homeland Security. \"If they were to transmit human to human, then we would be at a worse situation than COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates.\" This is because bird flu strains can be particularly deadly among human populations. According to the World Health Organization, the case-fatality rate of H7N9 is roughly 30%; H5N1 is 60%. It may be unlikely the H10N3 strain can transmit between humans, Richt said, but scientists can't know for sure until they learn its genetic code and conduct epidemiological surveillance to determine if any other contacts were infected.

{"id": "27", "fulltext": "Chinese health authorities said a 41-year-old man had contracted a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3 and had been in the hospital since late April, calling it the first reported human case globally from the strain. The National Health Commission said the man developed a fever and other symptoms on April 23 and was admitted to hospital in Jiangsu province five days later. On Tuesday the health commission said his condition was stable and indicated he was ready to be discharged. How did the man become infected? The health commission didn't give details on how the man came into contact with the virus. Cases of bird flu in humans have most commonly been reported among those in close daily contact with poultry, such as chicken farmers. The commission advised the public to avoid contact with sick and dead poultry. Can bird flu kill people? Avian influenza can be fatal in humans. Highly pathogenic strains, such as H5N1, can have a mortality rate of about 60%, according to the World Health Organization. However, the WHO says, bird flu doesn't spread easily from birds to people. How common are bird-flu outbreaks in China? China has seen several outbreaks of bird flu, including one at the height of the coronavirus outbreak last year, when H5N1 avian influenza killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. In May, China's Agriculture Ministry said the H5N8 strain of bird flu killed hundreds of wild birds in Tibet, prompting authorities to disinfect areas including a national wetland park. Are authorities worried? China said the risk of a large-scale outbreak was extremely low. It said local health authorities' contact-tracing and monitoring efforts had found no other cases and no human-to-human transmission. It said the H10N3 strain doesn't have the ability to effectively infect humans. What do experts say? Human infections with bird-flu viruses are rare but not uncommon, said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, a professor at the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. 'It is highly likely that this infection just represents one of the rare incidents of human infection with an avian influenza virus, without any more consequences,' said Prof. Garcia-Sastre. 'Nevertheless, it's important to make sure that this is just that, a rare isolated incident.' The fact that the case happened in April and there hasn't been any other reports of cases suggests there hasn't been a cluster of infections, says Peng Shifang, a professor of infectious diseases at Central South University in China's Hunan province. Is China upfront about the recent bird-flu case? China said it had determined on May 28 through genome sequencing that the man suffered from the H10N3 strain. It issued its statement on the results on Tuesday. While China has been criticized for a lack of transparency in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, its public-health apparatus is generally seen as having become more transparent since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, when official secrecy hampered the response.

The man, 55, was hospitalized in Bazhong, a city in the southwestern province of Sichuan, after coming down with a fever and testing positive for the virus on July 6, the state-run China Global Television Network reported. Local officials had activated an emergency response and sterilized the area, the broadcaster said in a brief report in English. It cited unnamed experts as saying that the risk of large-scale transmission among humans was low. The report did not provide other details or say whether the man handled poultry as part of his job. The H5N6 virus is one of several potentially dangerous flu versions that scientists have reported finding over the years in poultry flocks or in captured or dead wild birds. It was first detected eight years ago in Laos, and later spread to China and other countries.

A bird flu prevention zone has been declared across Great Britain to stop the spread of the disease among poultry and other birds. Since 5pm on Wednesday, all bird keepers have been legally required to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks. On Wednesday a flock of poultry was culled near Dundee in Scotland after a bird flu outbreak. Earlier this week cases were detected in wild birds and poultry in Wrexham, Wales. The disease has been detected in wild birds at multiple sites across Great Britain. Bird flu circulates naturally among wild birds, and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe in winter the disease can be spread to poultry and other captive birds. In advice published on the Defra website, UK health agencies and food standards agencies say the risk to public health from the virus is very low. According to the NHS, bird flu can affect humans in rare cases if people touch infected birds, their droppings or bedding, or while preparing infected poultry for cooking. Under the prevention zone, people with more than 500 birds must now restrict access for non-essential visitors, change clothing and footwear before entering enclosures, and ensure vehicles are cleaned and disinfected regularly. Areas where birds are kept must be kept unattractive to wild birds, for example by netting ponds and removing food sources. Small backyard owners with only a small number of birds, including chicken, ducks and geese, have been told to limit risks and keep watch for signs of disease. In a joint statement, the chief veterinary officers for England, Scotland and Wales said all bird keepers had to take action. Following a number of detections of avian influenza in wild birds across Great Britain we have declared an avian influenza prevention zone across the whole of Great Britain, the statement said. Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to introduce higher biosecurity standards on your farm or small holding.

It is attracting the attention too of epidemiologists as the virus can be transmitted to humans. China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza so far this year, more than in the whole of 2020. South Korea reported an outbreak at a farm of around 770,000 poultry in Chungcheongbuk-do, the OIE said on Monday, citing a report from the South Korean authorities. All animals were slaughtered. Also in Asia, Japan reported its first outbreak of the 2021 winter season, at a poultry farm in the north-east of the country, the OIE said, confirming a statement last week by Japan's agriculture ministry.

{"id": "32", "fulltext": "George Eustice says restrictions in place since start of November require all birds to be kept indoors The UK has been hit by a record outbreak of avian flu that has led to 500,000 captive birds being culled in recent months. The environment secretary, George Eustice, told the House of Commons: 'This year we are now seeing the largest ever outbreak in the UK of avian influenza, with 36 confirmed cases.' He said an avian influenza prevention zone had been declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. He added: 'Our chief veterinary officer continues to lead the response to this episode.' Earlier the chief vet, Christine Middlemiss, said she was 'very concerned about what's happening.' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme after confirming more outbreaks overnight, she said: 'We now have a total of 40 infected premises in the UK. That's a really high number for the time of year for anything we've experienced before.' By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. Middlemiss said: 'All the birds on the premises have to be culled because of the ongoing risk of infection that they pose. The total number is something like half a million will now have been culled.' She said food supplies would not be hit. 'That sounds a huge number, and for those keepers affected it is really devastating, but it's a relatively very small number in terms of egg supply, meat, chicken and so on.' The disease is spread by migratory wild birds from Europe, where high infections levels are also being recorded. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive for avian flu, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland's Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected avian flu case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on Trotternish, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Middlemiss said almost 300 wild birds had been found with the disease at more than 80 locations. There was 'a lot of virus out there,' she said. The risk to human health is low but infected birds should not be touched. She said: 'It used to be that we would have a reasonable-sized outbreak and then have two or three quiet years. But that's not happening now. We're seeing this across the whole of Europe. We need to understand better why we're getting these ongoing infections every year.' Asked if the disease was still spreading, Middlemiss said: 'We're continuing to get the new detections. I confirmed another two last night and that's the rate we've been going at for the last week or so. We're seeing this as a huge pressure of infection from our wild birds.' Middlemiss urged people with garden bird feeders to 'practice routine hygiene precautions including proper handwashing.' She added: 'If you keep chickens and you want to feed wild birds, you need to make sure that everything is completely scrupulously clean and absolutely separate so that you don't take infection into your own birds and make them sick.' Asked if the climate crisis was to blame for the increased infection, Middlemiss said: 'We don't know specifically, but it's certainly one of the thoughts that our experts are having. The birds migrate to the north of Russia over the summer and mix with other birds on other global flight pathways and exchange the viruses. So it's quite plausible that with climate change and change in pathways that different mixing is going on.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 7}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "This year we are now seeing the largest ever outbreak in the UK of avian influenza, with 36 confirmed cases."}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "We now have a total of 40 infected premises in the UK.

{"id": "33", "fulltext": "With the UK hit by a record outbreak, here's a quick guide to the viral disease also known as avian influenza. What is avian flu? Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a contagious viral disease in animals, caused by a virus loosely related to human influenza. Some strains of the disease have been passed to humans but this is very rare, and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals. While all bird species and, less commonly, pigs are thought to be susceptible, domestic poultry flocks are especially vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks can rapidly result in epidemics among bird populations. Public health authorities are concerned about the potential of the virus to mutate into subtypes capable of causing human disease. As a result, they warn there is always a threat of a new influenza pandemic emerging. Why is it in the news again? The UK has been hit by a record outbreak that has resulted in 500,000 captive birds being culled this autumn. An avian influenza prevention zone was declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. What are the most dangerous strains? The NHS says there are four strains that have caused particular concern in recent years. The first, identified in 1997, was H5N1, followed by H7N9 in 2013, H5N6 the following year, and H5N8 in 2016. The H5N1 form has been the cause of most concern in recent years and the UK government has said particular safety measures were put in place in parts of North Yorkshire on 21 November after confirmed and suspected cases of that strain in poultry in the area. Where has it appeared? The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, has said there are 40 infected premises in the UK. They include 38 in Great Britain, of which 33 are in England, and two in Northern Ireland. By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland's Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on the Trotternish peninsula, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Some 22,100 ducks were culled at a commercial premises in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, while culling and an exclusion zone was also being applied to a second site in Broughshane, Co Antrim, described as a 'small backyard flock.' If it just affects birds, why the panic? It doesn't. World Health Organization (WHO) figures show that from 2003 to 2021 there were 863 confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus in humans. Of these cases, 456 people died. While transmission is rare, it has happened. So far, most of the human deaths have been in countries in Asia, in communities in which people live in close proximity to poultry. Although it does not easily infect humans, every time it does it increases the chance that the virus could mutate into a form that could be passed from one infected human to another. The WHO fears this could lead to a flu pandemic. How do you catch bird flu? It is very unlikely you will catch the virus unless you have been in close contact with infected birds or someone with confirmed or suspected bird flu. The virus is found in secretions from the eyes and respiratory tract, and droppings of infected birds. Humans can catch the virus by inhaling droplets sneezed by infected birds or the dust from their bedding or droppings. What are the symptoms in humans? They vary depending on the strain. Most infections have flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and aches and pains. Symptoms of the H5N1 subtype are more severe and frequently result in death. Other symptoms can include conjunctivitis, red, sore and discharging eyes. How does it spread? WHO scientists have said they believe it is likely the virus is carried by migrating birds. More recently the UK government has said it spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. Officials added: 'It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear. Avian influenza isn't an airborne virus.' It can spread to humans who touch infected birds, droppings or bedding or who kill or prepare infected poultry for cooking, the NHS has said. People cannot catch bird flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas affected by an outbreak, health officials have said. What measures is the UK taking? The government has said the chief veterinary officers for each of the UK's constituent nations have agreed to bring in new housing measures to protect poultry and captive birds from avian influenza following a number of confirmed cases across Great Britain in recent weeks. It added: 'The new housing measures, which will come into force on Monday 29 November, mean that it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.' How do you spot the virus in birds? Symptoms in infected birds include a swollen head and blue discoloration around the neck and throat. They will also show signs of breathing problems including gaping beaks, coughing, sneezing and rattling wheezing. Poultry farmers will also notice a loss of appetite in the infected birds and a decrease in egg laying. People are advised not to touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds they find. In Great Britain, dead wild waterfowl or other wild birds should be reported to Defra. Some will then be collected and tested to help scientists understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird. What drug treatments are available to humans? There is no vaccine for avian flu. If a person were infected, the NHS has said they would be either told to stay at home or put into isolation in hospital.

{"id": "34", "fulltext": "LONDON (AP) — U.K. authorities reported an unprecedented jump in early season cases of avian flu in both domestic and wild birds, triggering tight restrictions on poultry farmers across the country. The government has confirmed 40 outbreaks of avian flu among poultry and other captive birds this year, resulting in the culling of about 500,000 birds, Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said Thursday. There were 24 outbreaks during the entire 2020-21 bird flu season, which ran through the spring. “I’m very concerned about what’s happening,” Middlemiss told the BBC. “That’s a really high number for the time of year for anything we’ve experienced before, and that’s because of the high level of infection in the migratory wild birds. So it’s really, really concerning because those birds will stay with us over the winter until early spring and the risk of infection remains.” U.K. authorities keep a close eye on avian flu cases around the world because it is spread by migrating birds and can be devastating to poultry producers. Experts estimate that outbreaks during the 2014-15 and 2016-17 seasons cost U.K. poultry producers about 125 million pounds ($165 million). While the risk to humans is low, bird flu can affect people in rare cases. To control the spread of the disease, poultry producers must kill all birds at sites where infections are confirmed. In addition, they have been ordered to keep all birds inside or under nets to stop them from coming in contact with wild fowl, and to implement strict hygiene measures. While the number of birds culled so far this season sounds large, it is relatively small compared with the number of birds on U.K. poultry farms. Between the beginning of August and the end of October, poultry producers slaughtered about 20 million birds a week, according to the latest government statistics. “In terms of food supply impact, it’s actually a relatively small number,” Middlemiss said of flu-related culling. The situation in Britain is part of a larger trend across Europe, where authorities are seeing more frequent outbreaks of avian flu, Middlemiss said. Although researchers don’t know the reasons for the trend, one theory is that climate change has altered the migration patterns of wild birds, she said. “The birds migrate to the north of Russia over the summer and mix with other birds and other global flight pathways there and they exchange the viruses, so it’s quite plausible that with climate change and change in pathways different mixing is going on,” Middlemiss said. “But that hasn’t been fully investigated yet.”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "U.K. authorities reported an unprecedented jump in early season cases of avian flu in both domestic and wild birds, triggering tight restrictions on poultry farmers across the country."}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_3", "statement": "“I’m very concerned about what’s happening,” Middlemiss told the BBC. “That’s a really high number for the time of year for anything we’ve experienced before, and that’s because of the high level of infection in the migratory wild birds.

Uri Naveh, a senior scientist at the Israel Parks and Nature Authority, said the situation is not yet under control. \"Many of the birds are dead in the middle of the water body so it's difficult for them to be taken out,\" he said Monday. Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg called the crisis \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country.\" \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" she tweeted. Yaron Michaeli, spokesman for the Hula Lake park, where the crane population is centered, said workers were removing the carcasses as quickly as possible, fearing they could infect other wildlife. Dafna Yurista, spokeswoman for the Agriculture Ministry, said half a million chickens in the area were being slaughtered to prevent the disease from spreading. About 500,000 cranes pass through Israel each year on the way to Africa and a small number stay behind, Michaeli said. This year, an estimated 30,000 cranes stayed in Israel for the winter. Michaeli said it is believed that the cranes were infected by smaller birds that had contact with farms suffering from outbreaks. Israeli media carried photos of workers in white hazmat suits collecting crane carcasses after the birds were first found to be sick about 10 days ago. Michaeli said the death toll among cranes appears to have stabilized in recent days. \"This is a good sign,\" he said. \"They might be starting to get over this. We hope very much.\" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said officials from the agriculture, environment and health ministries were monitoring the situation.

{"id": "37", "fulltext": "Israel is battling the coronavirus and a surge in flu cases. But it's an outbreak of the H5N1 avian flu among migratory cranes and domestic poultry that is drawing global concern. The bird flu, as it's also called, is spreading fast in northern Israel, where at least 5,200 cranes have died of the disease and hundreds of thousands of chickens have been culled in an effort to contain its advance. The avian flu is confined mostly to birds. It rarely jumps to humans, but when it does it can be lethal. As of October, the World Health Organization had confirmed 863 cases of H5N1 in people, 456 of whom died, around the world since 2003. Israel has not recorded any infections in humans this year. Those who have possibly been exposed to the virus are receiving preventive antiviral treatments. Other countries, including Britain, China, Norway and South Korea, have also reported major or higher-than-usual H5N1 outbreaks in recent months. In November, Britain declared a bird flu prevention zone, requiring all farmers to follow stricter biosecurity protocols after several outbreaks. Israel is a central stop along the route of many species of birds migrating from Europe and Asia to Africa, a convergence that raises the risk of avian flu spreading from wild birds to captive poultry populations in the country. Each year, about 500,000 cranes migrate through Israel, some 30,000 of which stayed to winter over there this year. The yearly stopover, often part of journeys lasting thousands of miles, draws the attention of bird enthusiasts, who travel to observe the large, long-legged and long-necked birds. The H5N1 outbreak has wrought \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country,\" Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg said in a tweet Sunday. She shared a photo of dead cranes peppering a lake in Israel's Hula Nature Reserve, a hot spot for migratory birds. \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" Zandberg said. Israel reported its first cases of bird flu in 2006, and has seen outbreaks nearly every year since, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The extent of this year's train of transmission is not yet clear, but regulations require poultry and wild birds be kept separated to limit the chance of transference. Word of Israel's latest outbreak began to spread on Dec. 19, when the Agriculture Ministry reported that H5N1 had been detected in a farming community, Margaliot, near Israel's northern border with Lebanon. The ministry said it had closed off the area and halted egg production. Crowded and unregulated chicken coops are a \"ticking bomb\" for developing diseases, Agriculture Minister Oded Feror said in a statement at the time. That same day, Israeli media reported that about 100 cranes had died in a bird flu outbreak in Hula Lake in a nature reserve in northern Israel. Authorities closed down the area to the public and days later temporarily shut the entire nature reserve. Israel's Nature and Parks Authority shared photos of workers in hazmat suits collecting the bodies of dead cranes from the water. In the following days, outbreaks were detected in at least three other farms in the north as the Agriculture Ministry underwent mass testing. The parks authority said Thursday that an estimated 1 in 5 cranes in Israel were likely to be infected with the virus, Israeli media reported. There have also been reports of deaths from the virus among other bird species. Israel's Agricultural Ministry has warned the public to buy only eggs with the required regulatory stamp and to consume thoroughly cooked eggs to prevent any further spread. The public has also been warned to keep a distance from wild birds. On Tuesday, the ministry told chicken farmers in Margaliot to monitor cats that spend time around the coops, as felines can also become infected with the virus. Israeli media outlets reported that the mass culling of chickens has created a shortage of between 15 million and 20 million eggs a month. About 200 million eggs are consumed monthly in Israel.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 10}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "The avian flu is confined mostly to birds.

{"id": "38", "fulltext": "Thousands of migratory cranes have died and more than half a million chickens have been culled as the country tries to contain a deadly bird virus. JERUSALEM — Israel is acting to contain a severe outbreak of avian flu that has already led to mass culling of infected poultry and has caused the deaths of about 5,000 migratory cranes in a popular nature reserve in the north of the country. The minister of environmental protection, Tamar Zandberg, described the outbreak, identified as the H5N1 type, as 'one of the worst blows to wildlife in Israel's history' after a visit to the Hula Nature Reserve this week. Hula is a wetland that is a central stop on the winter migration route to Africa. The reserve, usually bustling with bird watchers at this time of year, is temporarily closed to visitors and the Ministry of Environmental Protection said on Wednesday that Ms. Zandberg was working to suspend the rest of the hunting season in the country, which normally runs until the end of January. The fear, the ministry said, was that gunshots from bird hunters could cause the wild birds to fly off to other locations, spreading the disease, which it said could also be spread by contaminated car tires on hunters' vehicles or on the soles of their shoes, or by the dogs retrieving their prey. Officials have also warned of the danger of the transmission of avian flu from animals to humans, which could be deadly. No such cases have been recorded in Israel. The first signs of the outbreak came about two months ago, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, with infections cropping up in chicken and turkey farms in different areas of the country. Israel's minister of agriculture and rural development, Oded Forer, said about 600,000 chickens had been culled. He said that would mean a shortfall of 15 million eggs per month over the next few months and that the department was working to import millions of eggs. In an interview with Kan Radio, Israel's public broadcaster, on Tuesday, Mr. Forer blamed the outdated, overcrowded chicken coops that he said were common in Israel for the severity of the outbreak of the virus. The egg industry had been 'neglected for years,' he said, adding that most of the coops in Israel were like those from the 1950s or 60s, and that there was a need to move to more modern coops without cages. More than 100,000 cranes can gather in the Hula Valley during the migration season, which begins in October, according to the reserve, and in recent years many have sojourned there until the spring, when they move back north. The reserve said about 40,000 cranes were documented in the valley early this month. By mid-December the number of dead cranes began to mount up and avian flu was identified as the cause. Most of the dead birds have been found in the water. The avian flu outbreak comes as Israel braces for what its prime minister, Naftali Bennett, has called 'a storm of infection' from the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 1}]}

Gosling, who had about another 100 ducks living outside on his property in Buckfastleigh, noticed several birds falling ill shortly before Christmas, Devon Live reports. Subsequent tests by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) were returned positive for the H5N1 strain of avian flu.

The RSPB has called for an emergency shooting ban after an 'unprecedented' outbreak of bird flu that has left wildfowl populations in 'catastrophic decline.' Migratory geese that overwinter on the Solway Firth, which stretches between Scotland and Cumbria, are being hardest hit, with a 38% decline in the Svalbard barnacle goose breeding population from winter last year. While these are protected species and not subject to hunting, experts argue that pressure from wildfowlers on nearby, legal quarry species can have an impact. Shoots nearby can cause stress, scaring the birds into the air where they use up vital energy. Some estimates suggest the UK is facing the worst outbreak of avian influenza on record. Latest population counts of the Svalbard breeding population show a drop in numbers from 43,703 in November last year to 27,133 in this month's counts. Paul Walton, the head of habitats and species at RSPB Scotland, said: 'We are in the grip of an unprecedented outbreak and unfortunately the Solway seems to be the epicentre of this in the UK. Our birds are suffering and they need an urgent reprieve to help them get through this winter and ensure that as many as possible of those remaining survive to make their migration back home to Scandinavia to breed in the summer. The best way we can do this is by reducing the cumulative impacts of disturbance, including by wildfowling. Our teams on the ground are seeing many birds that are sick or dying and under significant stress. Anything that can be done to limit activities which incur additional disturbance at this time should be implemented with urgency. This action could help these populations during this period of catastrophic decline caused by the outbreak.' There are allowances under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 for a temporary pause in the hunting of wildfowl if there are prolonged periods of freezing weather. The RSPB is asking for this consideration in the event of a severe avian influenza outbreak. It has also asked the public to keep dogs under close control in the Solway coastal area to avoid further disturbing the birds. After the barnacle goose gained protection in the 1950s, following a long campaign by conservationists, the world population rose from just a few hundred individuals to about 40,000. But the recent sharp decline has made experts concerned the good work could be undone. Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry bird flu. Many bird populations, from chickens to swans, have been hit by the flu, which is deadly. An avian influenza prevention zone came into force across Great Britain on 3 November, meaning birdkeepers must keep their flock separate from wild birds and put strict biosecurity measures in place.

The agency said avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S. The USDA said turkey infections are the first confirmation of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry in the U.S. since 2020. The Indiana State Board of Animal Health said samples from the farm were analyzed at the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Purdue University after about 100 turkeys died. The state agency said the farm is under quarantine and that state officials are working with the poultry producers statewide to increase monitoring of flocks. A January 2016 outbreak of bird flu in Dubois County affected 11 poultry farms, resulting in the loss of more than 400,000 birds, the State Board of Animal Health said. Indiana ranks third nationally in turkey production, first in duck production, second in production of table eggs and egg-laying chickens, and is a significant producer of broiler chickens, the state agency said.

{"id": "45", "fulltext": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A strain of avian flu that can cause high mortality rates among birds hasn't spread to neighboring farms since it was confirmed at a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana, state officials said Thursday. Poultry farms with a 10-kilometer (6.2-miles) control area around the infected Dubois County farm have completed an initial round of surveillance testing for highly pathogenic avian influenza, and all of the tests were negative, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health said. Testing of the control-area farms will continue on a weekly basis, the agency said. The 18 commercial poultry flocks within the control area are under quarantine until further notice, it said. Animal Health Board staff have reached out to known hobby/backyard poultry owners in the control area to schedule testing of birds there, it said.

{"id": "46", "fulltext": "An outbreak of the bird flu has been reported on a turkey farm in southern Indiana and nearly 30,000 turkeys have already been euthanized in efforts to control the spread. This does not present an immediate concern to public health, federal officials said, but it does have agriculture and industry folks worried. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the confirmed case of the H5N1 strain of avian flu at a farm in Dubois County. It is a highly pathogenic strain, meaning it is lethal to all poultry that contract the disease. This is the nation's first confirmed case of the flu in a commercial operation since 2020 and six years since it was last found on farms in Indiana, when hundreds of thousands of birds were killed as a result.

'This is a foreign animal disease and shouldn't be on our landscape,' said Denise Derrer Spears, the spokeswoman of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. 'That flips the switch and makes this a big deal right off the bat, and we need to stamp it out before it gets out of control.' The response to the outbreak has been swift, both from state and federal agencies as well as the economy. Taiwan has restricted poultry meat and egg products from Indiana while China and Korea blocked non-heated poultry meat from the state, the USDA said on its website. Though limited, these trade restrictions and loss of poultry are a blow to the farm sector and individual producers. You cannot get bird flu from eating fully cooked poultry meat or eggs, according to medical experts. This does not present a food safety risk, and the USDA said turkeys from the affected farm will not enter the food supply. 'But it's a matter of public perception,' Derrer Spears said. The current situation began on Feb. 7, when the affected farmer noticed about 100 birds were dead in one of his barns and the remaining ones were lethargic. He worked with his veterinarian to get samples collected from the flock and sent to a lab at Purdue University. The results were then confirmed at a USDA lab in Iowa. The name of the affected farm has not been publicly identified. As soon as the state received the results, it issued a quarantine at the site and all those farms within a 10-kilometer radius. That includes 17 other operations, Derrer Spears said. She could not give exact numbers on how many birds were impacted, but it's likely more than a few hundred thousand. Dubois County is the top turkey-producing county in Indiana. And Indiana is the third-largest turkey-producing state in the country, the No. 1 state in duck production and the second largest in table eggs and egg-laying chickens. All those farms within the control area will have to test their animals at least once each week to monitor for the disease. The first round of tests came back negative, Derrer Spears said, but the state is remaining very cautious. 'While it's just one incident right now, 18 farms in total are affected by this,' she added. 'There is no cure for this disease, there is no way to save the birds, all birds will die from this so we want to put them down as quickly as possible.' The control area will remain in effect until the affected farm is fully cleaned, the euthanized turkeys are disposed of and no further cases are detected. All turkeys at the infected farm, 29,000 birds, were put down by Wednesday night, according to the state. That depopulation needs to happen as quickly as possible so that the birds do not languish and so the virus does not have more time to spread. The euthanized turkeys will then be disposed of onsite by composting them, a method that is approved and overseen by state and federal agencies. The barns and all equipment will also need to be thoroughly cleaned 'flat off the floor clean,' Derrer Spears said. Once the cleaning is complete and the disposal has reached a certain stage, the quarantine will be lifted. There are many factors involved and there is no target date to do that, the state said it likely will be about four to six weeks. It is unclear how the Dubois County flock was infected. The avian flu viruses are fairly common in wild migratory birds and waterfowl, according to Derrer Spears, and ducks and geese that contract the disease will spread it in their droppings as they fly by. The strain has been wreaking havoc on Asia and Europe and also has been found in some wild birds along the East Coast. Canada recently confirmed H5N1 bird flu in a commercial poultry operation in Nova Scotia. This outbreak is significant because it shows that the strain has entered a migratory pathway for birds called the Mississippi Flyway, which follows the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and includes several major poultry states such as Indiana. The last time this bird flu was found in commercial poultry in Indiana was in January 2016. 'Last time we had this, it was terrible,' Derrer Spears said. That situation similarly started with one flock and then testing showed that it had spread to nearly a dozen other flocks. Ultimately, more than 400,000 birds needed to be euthanized. The year prior, in 2015, the same strain wreaked havoc on the Midwest turkey industry and caused the largest animal disease outbreak ever in the U.S. While Indiana remained largely unscathed from that national outbreak, it led to the destruction of more than 50 million birds and cost the U.S. economy more than $3 billion.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 6}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "'This is a foreign animal disease and shouldn't be on our landscape,' said Denise Derrer Spears, the spokeswoman of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health.

{"id": "47", "fulltext": "Poultry producers battle avian flu spread U.S. poultry producers are tightening safety measures for their flocks as disease experts warn that wild birds are probably spreading a highly lethal form of avian flu across the country. Indiana on Wednesday reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu on a commercial turkey farm, leading China, South Korea and Mexico to ban poultry imports from the state, and putting the industry on edge at a time that labor shortages are fueling food inflation. The disease is already widespread in Europe and affecting Africa, Asia and Canada, but the outbreak in Indiana, which is on a migratory bird pathway, particularly rattled U.S. producers. A devastating U.S. bird flu outbreak in 2015 killed nearly 50 million birds, mostly turkeys and egg-laying chickens in the Midwest. The United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government. \"Everyone is just sitting on edge because we know what can happen and we don't want a repeat of that,\" said Denise Heard, vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association, an industry group. Poultry company Perdue Farms suspended in-person visits to farms to avoid spreading the disease, spokeswoman Diana Souder said. Advisers are instead communicating with farmers via phone and email to reinforce protocols, and monitor birds' health, she said. \"When you are dealing with a confirmed case now in the country, we know there is heightened risk,\" said Mike Naig, Iowa's agriculture secretary. \"It's time to move to a higher alert for our livestock producers.\" Disease experts said a wild bird probably spread the H5N1 virus to Indiana from the East Coast, where officials have confirmed that wild ducks were infected with the strain. The U.S. Agriculture Department called the disease low risk to humans. Reuters OPEC's low output strains oil market Global oil prices could climb further because of the OPEC Plus coalition's \"chronic\" struggle to revive production, unless the group's Middle Eastern heavyweights pump extra to compensate, the International Energy Agency warned. Crude has rallied to a seven-year high, to above $90 a barrel, as demand bounces back from the pandemic while supplies around the world lag. Plagued by underinvestment and disruptions, the 23-nation OPEC Plus alliance has been unable to fully restore the output it halted—a problem the IEA expects to worsen. With oil inventories at the lowest in seven years, the agency sees markets facing further strain. \"The oil market is incredibly tight,\" \"Prices continue to surge and are now reaching levels that are uncomfortable for consumers across the world,\" Toril Bosoni, head of the agency's markets and industry division, said in a Bloomberg television interview on Friday. By the end of the year, the shortfall between the amount of oil OPEC Plus was supposed to have pumped and what it actually delivered since the start of 2021 could amount to 1 billion barrels, the IEA estimates. Rising prices have been an acute source of pain for major economies, fanning a surge in inflation.

Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. chicken processor by sales, confirmed that the farm housed the company's chickens. A separate outbreak was confirmed in a backyard flock of birds in Fauquier County, Va., the USDA said. State officials quarantined the affected areas, and the birds on the farms will be destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease. Federal and state authorities are surveilling and testing areas around the affected flocks, the USDA said. None of the affected birds will enter the food supply, according to the USDA. Recent avian-influenza outbreaks haven't posed a health risk to humans, federal officials have said. A severe outbreak in the U.S. could pose a threat to poultry companies such as Tyson, Perdue Farms Inc., Sanderson Farms Inc. and Pilgrim's Pride Corp. Meat companies are already raising prices as they cite worker shortages that have left them unable to meet customer demand, as well as higher transportation and feed costs. Tyson is working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus, a spokesman said, and the company doesn't expect the affected farm in Kentucky to affect its overall chicken production levels. Tyson Foods said last week on its quarterly earnings call with analysts that the Arkansas-based company has increased biosecurity protections in its East Coast facilities, taking extra time to clean vehicles that go to farms and reducing the number of trips to farms overall. 'We have very robust biosecurity measures in place across all of our facilities, and that includes testing every flock for avian influenza,' David Bray, group president of poultry for Tyson, said on the call. Multiple bird-flu cases have been reported across North America in recent weeks, prompting poultry companies to take action. Avian influenza has been confirmed in commercial and backyard flocks in three states this year, the USDA said. An outbreak was reported last week in Dubois County, Ind., on a commercial turkey farm. Earlier this month, bird flu was detected in two wild birds in Florida. In January, a separate case was found in a wild bird in Colleton County in South Carolina, according to the USDA. Canada also recently confirmed a bird-flu case in a commercial turkey farm in western Nova Scotia. The U.S. poultry industry has remained largely unaffected by the disease since an outbreak in 2015 led to the deaths of more than 50 million chickens and turkeys. Since then, chicken, turkey and egg processors invested in new biosecurity measures and other precautions to stem the disease's spread Perdue Farms said none of the recent outbreaks have affected its flocks, but the positive cases are concerning, a company spokeswoman said. The Maryland-based company is having all of its flock advisers visit the farmers in their service area to review biosecurity protocols, she said. Shares of Tyson closed down about 3% Monday. Shares of Sanderson Farms and egg giant Cal-Maine Foods Inc. both declined about 1%, while Pilgrim's Pride declined 0.5%. Major stock indexes declined by less than 1%. Any immediate impact on poultry companies' sales is likely to be minimal, because chicken-importing countries may decide to continue purchasing U.S. poultry products from states where bird flu hasn't been detected, said Christine McCracken, executive director of meat research at agricultural lender Rabobank. A bigger impact on exports could come if the virus is reported in major poultry producing states like Arkansas, she said. 'It is being carried by wild birds so there isn't much control over the spread other than traditional biosecurity measures,' Ms. McCracken said. 'It's still early in the season, but it wouldn't be surprising if additional cases are found.' Labor shortages on farms also may increase the risk of spreading the virus, she said. Chicken producers are relying on a smaller number of available workers to clean more farms, and newer workers may not be as efficient at certain hygiene practices, she said.

{"id": "50", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Farms that raise turkeys and chickens for meat and eggs are on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity, fearing a repeat of a widespread bird flu outbreak in 2015 that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion. The new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana. The 29,000 turkeys in the flock were killed to prevent the spread of the virus. Indiana officials said Tuesday a second flock of 26,473 turkeys near the first infected farm is suspected to have the same virus. Testing is underway to confirm. The second location already is within a quarantine zone established for the first farm. The USDA also has confirmed the presence of bird flu in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and are awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky. A backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also is positive for the virus. State officials quarantined areas and the birds at the new positively identified sites will be killed and removed. The poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they're urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry. Egg, turkey and chicken prices could rise and availability could drop if birds at enough farms were to be infected. It's definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry, said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. I feel positive that we can tackle this situation better and I have my fingers crossed that this will be an isolated case, however, I would hope for the best and be prepared for the worst. Health officials say no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S. and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern. The virus can spread from infected birds to people but such infections are rare and haven't led to sustained outbreaks among humans. The 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer, and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation's leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The disease caused egg and turkey prices across the country to soar for months, with the cost of eggs up 61% at one point and prices for boneless, skinless turkey breasts rising 75% between May and July 2015. The outbreaks were deemed the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history, costing the government nearly $1 billion for removal and disposal of infected birds and government indemnity payments to producers for the lost birds. The strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus. It has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified. Migratory wild birds often carry strains of avian influenza and they're often low pathogenic, which means they don't kill the birds. Sometimes those strains can get into domestic flocks and mutate into more deadly viruses. The H5N1 now spreading from wild birds is already highly pathogenic, which means it is deadly from the start, said Dr. Yuko Sato, a veterinarian and assistant professor in the Department of Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine at Iowa State University. U.S. surveillance efforts have identified the virus in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and South Carolina, making it apparent that it is in the environment broadly. The virus spreads easily from wild bird droppings and can be carried into commercial flocks on the feet of workers or on equipment, which is why high-level biosecurity protocol has been activated across the country in commercial operations. They've enacted new safeguards to prevent deadly bird flu infections, often referred to as HPAI, and isolate them when they occur. With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection, said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA, which deals with outbreaks on U.S. Federal and state officials are working with the poultry industry and have initiated steps such as an immediate quarantine that restricts movement of poultry and equipment used to move birds in and out of specified perimeters around an infected barn — usually around 6 miles (10 kilometers) initially — and eradication of the virus by killing and removing birds at the infection site. Testing occurs in the quarantine area of both wild and domestic birds. Disinfection is done to kill the virus at the affected farm and testing is used to confirm it's free of the virus. Producers who want to ensure eligibility for government indemnity payments in case of disaster must have a biosecurity protocol on hand that is updated regularly. To help with that, the USDA has developed a 14-point biosecurity plan for producers, which is audited yearly and reviewed every two years by state agriculture agencies, Sato said. In Iowa, a state with 49 million chickens, egg farmers are working with state and federal authorities to keep the disease out of their flocks, said Kevin Stiles, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council.

{"id": "51", "fulltext": "Poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia were confirmed to have birds infected with a highly lethal form of avian flu, federal agriculture officials said Monday, days after a flock of turkeys in Indiana tested positive, raising worries about a wider outbreak in the country. The most recently identified infections occurred at a Tyson Foods commercial broiler in Fulton County, Ky., that has 240,000 chickens, and in a backyard flock of mixed species in Fauquier County, Va. Kentucky officials said they were also waiting for the results of tests on a flock of turkeys in Webster County. The infections come after 29,000 turkeys were destroyed in Indiana once officials detected the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County. Federal officials said the Indiana outbreak was the first confirmed case in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020. The developments raise concerns that avian influenza could affect more poultry operations in the United States, which is the world's top producer of poultry and the No. 2 exporter in volume, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. They also come as the United States is seeing higher than usual inflation rates in necessities such as food. Avian influenza is carried by wild bird populations that spread the virus to domestic birds. Outbreaks involving more virulent strains result in higher mortality rates in domestic birds, potentially causing disruptions to the food supply. The outbreak in Fulton County was found after the operation reported an increase in poultry deaths to Kentucky officials. Avian influenza doesn't pose a public health risk to humans, U.S. agriculture officials said, so long as poultry and eggs are properly cooked at internal temperatures above 165 degrees. No human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the United States, although more than 700 global cases have been reported since 2003, federal officials say. Officials have quarantined the operations in Kentucky and Virginia, the Agriculture Department said, and birds at the locations will not enter the food system. Tyson Foods is heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, Gary Mickelson, a company spokesman, said in an emailed statement. The company tests all flocks for avian influenza before the birds leave the farms, he said. The recent outbreak will not affect Tyson's overall chicken production, because thousands of farms raise the birds for the firm, he added. In a deadly outbreak that occurred between December 2014 and June 2015, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys either died of HPAI or were killed to stop the disease's spread, according to the Agriculture Department. The federal government spent almost $880 million at the time to pay for the destruction of infected poultry, cleaning and indemnities for lost birds. The outbreak also led to a $1.1 billion decrease in exports of broiler chickens in 2015, compared with the prior year. Egg export income declined by $41 million, while income for turkey export fell by $177 million during the same period.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 1}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 4}]}
{"id": "52", "fulltext": "New confirmed cases of bird flu first noticed in Indiana are spreading among flocks of chickens and turkeys in three states, resulting in tens of thousands of birds testing positive for the virus. The new cases were reported last week when nearly 30,000 turkeys at a southern Indiana farm were euthanized after the H5N1 strain of avian flu was detected, the first time it had been seen in the U.S. since 2020. But on Monday and Tuesday, health officials said the same flu strain had been detected in 26,000 turkeys on another Indiana farm, as well as in a mixed flock of birds in Virginia and a flock of broiler chickens at a Tyson Foods farm in Kentucky. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the farms are quarantined and the birds in Virginia have been euthanized. The same will be done to those in Indiana and Kentucky, and another farm in western Kentucky is waiting on lab results. \"The risk is too high of spread to wait until the laboratory confirmation comes in, especially with the presumptive positive and clinical signs in the birds already,\" said Denise Derrer Spears, spokesperson for the Indiana board of animal health. \"So the owners are taking action to prevent further spread.\" There are an estimated 246,000 chickens at the Tysons farm, but it is unclear how many will be euthanized. Tyson Foods said in a statement to USA TODAY that they were working with Tennessee and Kentucky state officials, as well as federal officials, to prevent the spread. \"Tyson Foods is prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing. This includes heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, placing additional restrictions on outside visitors and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms. Tyson Foods' chicken products remain safe: the USDA confirms that avian influenza does not pose a food safety risk to consumers in poultry that is properly prepared and cooked. \"Because the affected farm in Kentucky is only one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for our company, the situation is not expected to impact our overall chicken production levels,\" the statement read. It is unclear how the latest bird flu cases began, but health officials have noted that migratory wild birds are likely spreading the disease. \"At this time, our goal is to continue to monitor the presence of (highly pathogenic avian influenza) in wild bird populations, and to quickly identify any instances where the virus spreads to commercial or backyard birds,\" the USDA said in a statement to USA TODAY. Kevin Stiles, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council, told The Associated Press steps were being taken to prevent the flu from entering the state. The state is the nation's leading egg producer and is home to 49 million chickens. \"IPA is maintaining open communications specifically related to biosecurity best practices and is offering surveillance testing. We are confident in our producers' preparedness and ability to manage their flocks,\" Stiles said. The National Chicken Council added the chicken industry remains on \"high alert,\" but plans are in place to control the spread of the virus. Health officials say no human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the U.S., and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern. The virus can spread from infected birds to people, but such infections are rare and haven't led to sustained outbreaks among humans. The 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation's leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The disease caused egg and turkey prices across the country to soar for months: The cost of eggs was up 61% at one point, and prices for boneless, skinless turkey breasts rose 75% between May and July 2015. The USDA recommends all bird owners should take precautions in making sure their birds don't get the virus, such as preventing contact with wild birds. The National Chicken Council adds farms should take safety measures such as limiting visitors, avoiding the sharing of farm equipment and disinfecting all personnel before they enter a facility.

{"id": "61", "fulltext": "A highly infectious strain of avian influenza has been found in waterfowl in Maryland and Virginia, wildlife advocates and environmental officials warn, but they say that it does not represent a threat to humans. Symptoms of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in birds include sneezing, coughing, walking or swimming in circles, and swelling of the legs and feet, the D.C. nonprofit City Wildlife said in a statement Tuesday. HPAI can also cause sudden death. Found in domestic and wild species, HPAI is highly contagious among birds. Although wild waterfowl are the most common carriers, they are often asymptomatic while birds of prey, such as hawks and owls, and scavengers, such as crows and gulls, may show more severe infection. Though not reported in the District yet, HPAI appears to be drawing closer. The U.S. Agriculture Department reported the disease Feb. 14 among a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Va. The disease is not an immediate public health concern, the USDA said in a statement, and no human cases have been detected.

{"id": "62", "fulltext": "Though the risk to humans is low, scientists warn that outbreaks among farmed birds increase the potential for the virus to mutate and pose a threat to humans. A highly contagious and deadly form of avian influenza has been barreling across the eastern half of the United States in recent weeks, killing both wild birds and farmed poultry and raising fears that an unchecked outbreak could prove calamitous for an industry that was devastated by a similar virus seven years ago. Since early January, when it began killing chickens in northeast Canada, the virus has been identified in migratory waterfowl from Florida to Maine, and has infected backyard chickens in Virginia and New York and sickened thousands of turkeys in Kentucky and Indiana, prompting mass cullings and import bans. On Wednesday, federal officials announced that the virus, a so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza, had been found in a Delaware commercial chicken farm on the Delmarva Peninsula, home to one of the country's largest concentrations of poultry farms. Experts suspect wild birds returning from winter feeding grounds are spreading the virus, most likely through contaminated droppings. With the peak springtime migration still weeks away, many fear the worst is yet to come. 'It's very concerning given how quickly this thing is accelerating,' said Henry Niman, a biochemist in Pittsburgh who studies the genetic evolution of viruses and has been tracking the outbreak's spread across the country. 'I think we could see historic levels of infections.' Federal officials have been urging poultry growers to report sick or dying birds and to tighten their farms' biosecurity measures, which includes preventing contact between wild birds and domestic animals. 'It's important to note that avian influenza is not considered to be a risk to public health and it's not a food-safety risk,' Mike Stepien, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in an email. Although the danger to humans is low, scientists are keeping a close eye on the virus, the Eurasian H5N1, which is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry. That virus does not spread efficiently among humans, but it is extremely deadly, with a fatality rate of 60 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The strain currently spreading across the United States has not jumped to humans, but virologists and epidemiologists say the mounting infections among birds is worrisome because it increases the possibility that the virus could mutate in ways that make it more infectious to people. Dr. Gail Hansen, a public health veterinarian who is the former state epidemiologist for Kansas, noted that influenza viruses have historically been behind the pandemics that affect humans. Some medical historians have traced the deadly influenza pandemic of 1918 to Army recruits in Kansas who may have caught the pathogen from farm animals and then spread it to military camps in Europe. 'Scientists always assumed the next pandemic would be a respiratory influenza,' she said. 'We were wrong with Covid, but it's these kinds of viruses that keep us awake at night.' The virus has also been coursing through Asia, the Middle East and Europe. In recent weeks, 300 outbreaks have been reported in 29 European countries. In Israel, an outbreak at a nature reserve killed thousands of cranes. At the moment turkey farmers, especially those in Indiana and Kentucky, are most worried. Over the past two weeks, several farms in those states have been shuttered after officials discovered the virus among birds that spend their entire lives crammed into massive sheds. Farmers say they have been stunned by how efficiently the virus kills, with animals dying hours after the initial infection. In Indiana, state officials have moved quickly, euthanizing more than 100,000 birds and throwing a six-mile cordon around affected farms — a containment area within which exports are halted and birds are tested daily. 'Everyone is on super-high alert and trying to be as prepared as possible because we all remember the devastation of 2014 and 2015,' said Dr. Denise Heard, a veterinarian with the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. The 2014-15 outbreak is considered the most destructive in the nation's history. It sent poultry and egg prices soaring and cost the industry more than $3 billion — though the federal government compensated farmers for lost flocks. In the end, nearly 50 million birds were killed by the virus or destroyed to prevent its spread, a vast majority of them in Iowa and Minnesota. John Burkel, 54, a fourth-generation turkey grower in northern Minnesota, has been watching the spread with trepidation. In 2015, the virus tore through his farm in a matter of days, leaving just 70 survivors in a shed that had held 7,000 birds. The weeks that followed were spent culling, composting the dead and then repeatedly disinfecting the barns. As a precaution, health officials also advised that he and his son take a course of the antiviral drug Tamiflu. 'We've never seen a virus that virulent,' said Mr. Burkel, a state legislator who works the farm with his wife and two children. 'It was just horrible.' Since then, agriculture officials across the country have pushed farmers to embrace an array of biosecurity measures aimed at preventing outbreaks. They include sealing up tiny holes that might allow mice or sparrows to enter barns, disinfecting the tires of feed-delivery trucks before they enter a farm and creating 'clean' and 'dirty' zones where workers can change into fresh footwear and coveralls before stepping inside an animal containment shed. At the same time, experts say that federal officials have strengthened the nationwide system of surveillance that allows researchers to track, in almost real time, an avian flu's spread within wild bird populations. 'I think the crisis of 2015 made us realize it takes a village to prevent an outbreak and has left us much better prepared,' said Dr. Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian at Iowa State University who advises local farmers about improving their biosecurity practices. But hypervigilance has its limits, especially against a microscopic pathogen that can infiltrate a barn on the leg of a single housefly. For a growing number of scientists, the real threat is the nation's industrialized system of meat and dairy production, with its reliance on genetically identical creatures packed by the thousands inside huge confinement sheds. Nearly all the nine billion chickens raised and slaughtered in the United States each year can trace their lineage to a handful of breeds that have been manipulated to favor fast growth and plump breasts. The birds are also exceptionally vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. 'They all have the same immune system, or lack of an immune system, so once a virus gets inside a barn, it's going to spread like wildfire,' said Dr. Hansen, the public health veterinarian. Andrew deCoriolis, the executive director of Farm Forward, a sustainable agriculture advocacy group, said the lack of genetic diversity isn't just a threat to the nation's food supply; it is also a potential threat to public health. More than half the 22 strains of novel influenza virus that the C.D.C. has identified as 'of special concern' to human health are avian influenza viruses, he said, noting that a 2018 study examining the emergence of 39 highly pathogenic avian viruses found that all but two of them had emerged on industrial poultry farms. He said the sector's emphasis on biosecurity and infection containment obscures a larger, thornier issue that requires a fundamental rethinking of meat and egg production in the United States. 'Instead of asking how factory farms can prevent infections that originate in the environment, which is how they frame it now, we should be asking how they can prevent infections that originate on factory farms,' he said. 'If we keep raising more and more animals in these conditions, we should expect the exact outcome we're getting because that's how the system is set up.'

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in the flock of fewer than 50 birds in Pottawattamie County. State officials quarantined the affected location and the birds were killed and incinerated to prevent the spread of the disease. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said since it was a small noncommercial flock there would be no resulting trade or supply chain issues. “The virus does appear to be very prevalent in wild birds so the next few months during the northern migration in the Mississippi flyway will be a time of high alert for all poultry owners,” he said. Cases have been discovered in flocks across the nation in the past month. The first infection was identified in a commercial flock of turkeys in Indiana on Feb. 9. Since then, five more flocks have been found with cases in Indiana, where more than 171,000 birds have been killed and removed. The virus also was detected in flocks of turkeys and broiler chickens in Kentucky last month, resulting in the destruction and disposal of more than 284,000 birds. A commercial chicken flock in Delaware also was infected, leading to the disposal of 1.2 million birds, the USDA said. A noncommercial backyard case also was identified Wednesday in Connecticut.

{"id": "71", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) Officials announced Monday that they have identified bird flu in a commercial flock of 50,000 turkeys in northwest Iowa, the state's second case of a virus that has been identified in multiple U.S. states. Iowa agriculture officials and the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the case in Buena Vista County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the case identified March 1 in a backyard flock of 42 ducks and chickens in Pottawattamie County. Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a disaster proclamation for Buena Vista County to allow state resources to help with disposal of the affected flock and disinfection of the farm. Officials didn't immediately disclose the number of birds involved. The emergency declaration also provides resources for tracking, monitoring and the rapid detection of bird flu. The turkeys have been killed and disposed of on the farm. A 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) control area has been established to limit traffic in and out of the area while extensive testing is done to ensure no other cases, said State Veterinarian Dr. Jeff Kaisand. He said five other commercial farms are within the zone and 37 backyard flocks. The discovery of avian influenza is especially troubling in Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer. In 2015, an outbreak led producers to kill 33 million hens in the state and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation's leading turkey producer. Smaller outbreaks were reported in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said in a statement that state and federal agriculture officials are working with producers to trace back, control and eradicate this disease from our state. Naig told reporters that if the virus spreads significantly into commercial egg, chicken or turkey populations, then consumer prices and product availability could become an issue. Cases have been reported in at least 12 states in backyard flocks and commercial production houses. We're not seeing a massive outbreak on a large scale and so I think it's too soon to be concerned about food impact or pricing impact at this point, but you have to acknowledge that can be an issue over time, he said.

A commercial chicken flock in Delaware also was infected, leading to the disposal of 1.2 million birds, the USDA said. In the past few days officials have identified the virus on a southeast Missouri farm with 240,000 broiler chickens, a commercial mixed species flock in southeastern South Dakota and an egg-laying hen operation in northeast Maryland.

Increasing levels of exposure will be harmful for animal health and reduce meat and dairy production in many parts of the world, according to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of the world's leading climate scientists. The world's first octopus farm looks set to open in the Canary Islands as government officials carry out an environmental assessment on plans for a facility starting in 2023. Animal rights activists have protested against the plans, with octopuses known to be intelligent and inquisitive as seen in the Netflix film My Octopus Teacher. One egg a day for everyone on the planet is the aim of an initiative to double global egg consumption over the next decade. Mexico and Japan lead the way at present with a per capita consumption of more than 300 eggs a year. Almost all of Japan's egg producers use battery cages as it continues to resist international pressure to improve welfare conditions for chickens. Europe's largest egg producer, France, has banned the slaughter of male chicks. The industry has until the end of 2022 to comply. Farmers will be required to look at alternative methods to ensure male chicks are not born, including the use of technology that enables the sex of the embryo to be identified before they develop into chicks and hatch. France is also trialling avian influenza vaccines as countries across Europe battle one of the worst winters for the disease on the continent. Any vaccine is complicated by the numerous strains of bird flu and the bans some countries have on importing poultry meat from countries that vaccinate birds. An outbreak of a deadly pig disease African swine fever was covered up by officials in Thailand, it has been claimed. The government denies the accusation and said most pig deaths were from another deadly disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. Meanwhile, the World Bank is funding a project to scale-up intensive pig farming in Vietnam. A provision to ban commercial mink farms in the US has been added to a bill making its way through Congress. Most countries in the EU have now banned fur farming, with the UK the first country to do so in 2000. China is on its way to becoming the world's biggest producer. UK news Farmed fish should have the same legal protection as other farmed animals, say animal welfare activists. The Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, which has the prime minister's wife Carrie Johnson as a patron, says fish deserve to be treated with the same care as cows, pigs, sheep and other livestock because they experience stress and pain. Herefordshire county council is asking residents if their health and wellbeing has been affected by intensive chicken farms. Of the 1.1 billion broiler chickens slaughtered each year in Britain, about 25% are raised in Herefordshire and Shropshire. A surge in poultry farms means there are 70 times more chickens than people in the two counties. Vets have described undercover footage showing cows from a Welsh dairy farm being kicked, hit with shovels and mistreated as 'abuse' and 'totally unnecessary.' The farm was stripped of its membership of the red tractor assurance scheme, which admitted that some welfare breaches are not always detectable during its inspections. The UK may no longer move ahead with a ban on the import and sale of fur and foie gras, according to reports. The ban had been proposed in the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto. British farmers have been banned from making foie gras 'created by force-feeding ducks or geese' since 2000. The use of critically important antibiotics on UK dairy farms fell by 98% between 2018 and 2021, according to an industry study. The vast majority of farm antibiotics in the UK are used in the pig and poultry sectors, both of which have reported significant reductions in recent years.

US president Joe Biden's pledge during Cop26 to reduce methane emissions by almost one-third has not, apparently, resulted in any limits on one of the country's biggest emitters: the beef sector. Industry figures admitted they had escaped 'relatively unscathed' but observers warned the US would never meet Biden's 2030 climate reduction goals without regulation. There have been renewed calls in the US to ban 'cruel' on-farm killing methods as the country braces itself for an increase in bird flu outbreaks. Using firefighting foam to suffocate animals and ventilation shutdown, in which animals are killed with extremely high heat and steam, are still permitted in the US, despite being labelled 'inhumane.'

{"id": "85", "fulltext": "Highly virulent variants of avian flu now appear endemic in wild birds, making farms prone to outbreaks all year, experts warn. Free-range chickens and eggs may no longer be feasible to produce in the UK and elsewhere in Europe in future due to a dramatic escalation in avian flu outbreaks, say leading disease experts. The UK and continental Europe have been hit by the largest outbreak of avian flu on record this winter, with millions of birds culled on farms across the continent. Experts say highly pathogenic variants of avian flu now appear to be endemic in wild birds, creating a risk of infection all year. In the UK, farmers have been ordered to keep their birds indoors since last November and as of this week have been prevented from selling their eggs as free range. The latest reported outbreak, at a farm in Suffolk last weekend, led to more than 80,000 ducks being culled after confirmation of a highly pathogenic variant of avian flu. 'There is a serious problem for free-range and outdoor farms,' said Dr Guillaume Fournié, a veterinarian and epidemiologist at the Royal Veterinary College. 'We are seeing outbreaks on large [indoor] poultry farms that would have had high biosecurity. This suggests that with high environmental exposure to the virus, now it's hard to ensure a farm is 100% biosecure.' Marion Koopmans, a virologist and adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO), said the situation was 'horrible' for the free-range poultry industry. 'The ecology [of avian flu] has changed drastically in just a few years. We now have local circulation all year round in Europe, it's not just a seasonal threat. It has a permanent presence in the wild bird population.' Highly pathogenic avian flu is already endemic in a number of countries in Asia, with infection of poultry reported all-year round. 'The question [in the UK/Europe] is whether sedentary (non-migratory) wild birds will maintain the virus circulation over the summer. This would mean a constant pressure of infection on poultry farms, which would then increase seasonally with migratory birds,' said Fournié. Koopmans, who took part in the WHO's Covid mission to China in 2021, said higher levels of biosecurity, vaccination of chickens and reductions in intensive poultry farms in parts of Europe may all be needed to prevent outbreaks. Measures to ensure biosecurity and prevent infection reaching hens include cleaning and disinfecting, safe storage of feed and water and quarantining new stock. France, which has experienced close to 1,000 avian flu outbreaks this winter, has been trialling avian influenza vaccines, but the solution has been complicated by the numerous variants of avian flu. The market for free-range eggs has grown rapidly in the UK over the past decade. Last year, almost two-thirds of 11 billion eggs produced in the UK last year were free-range, up from 27% in 2004. The Co-op, Sainsbury's, M&S, Morrisons and Waitrose no longer stock eggs that are not free-range. Some have suggested introducing covered outdoor areas or changing the rules for free-range egg producers to allow for longer periods spent indoors. However, it is unclear how consumers would react to this shift. 'The whole point of free-range is they have the opportunity to roam outside,' said Andrew Knight, a veterinary professor at the University of Winchester. Radically changing the rules for free-range eggs would be wrong, said Dan Crossley, from the Food Ethics Council. 'I think most people have a reasonable understanding of what free-range is, so what we want to avoid is muddying the water and any confusion around what different terms mean.' UK government officials have said there are no plans to review the existing legislation, which provided producers with a 16-week 'derogation' during which the free-range description can be kept on eggs even though the hens have been confined. Mark Williams, chief executive of the British Egg Industry Council, said he was confident that hens would be allowed outside again soon. 'The greatest risk comes when the migratory birds are carrying it around, which is why we have these outbreaks at the same time every year between Autumn and Spring,' he said. The UK Health Security Agency said there was year-round avian flu surveillance of dead wild birds. 'Despite recording a record number of outbreaks this season, the risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low,' said a spokesperson. Transmission from an infected bird to a human is very rare, according to health officials, with fewer than five cases recorded in the UK, most recently in January, when a man caught it from ducks he kept inside his home.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 13}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_4", "statement": "The ecology [of avian flu] has changed drastically in just a few years.

{"id": "87", "fulltext": "LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Avian influenza has been confirmed in wild birds found in three southeastern Michigan counties, the state Department of Natural Resources says. The DNR announced Thursday that highly pathogenic avian influenza had been detected in free-ranging Canada geese and tundra swans from St. Clair County, in snowy owls from Macomb County and in a mute swan from Monroe County. The discovery comes as millions of turkeys and chickens at commercial farms in numerous states have been killed this year due to avian influenza. The spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings of wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which often show no signs of illness. DNR Director Dan Eichinger said Michigan's ongoing focus is working to prevent the disease's spread in wildlife and domestic poultry in the state. He said that in light of Michigan's confirmed positive cases of avian flu in wild birds, officials are taking advantage of every available resource that aims to limit the spread of HPAI. The bird flu outbreak among commercial flocks in the U.S. was first detected in February in a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.

{"id": "88", "fulltext": "Ready for more bad infectious diseases news? There's an outbreak of bird flu making its way into U.S. poultry flocks. If the virus continues to spread, it could affect poultry prices—already higher amid widespread inflation. The price of chicken breasts this week averaged $3.63 per pound at U.S. supermarkets—up from $3.01 a week earlier and $2.42 at this time last year, the Agriculture Department says. This week an outbreak was confirmed at a commercial flock in Nebraska, causing 570,000 broiler chickens to be destroyed. In Delaware and Maryland, more than two million birds at commercial poultry flocks have been affected. In South Dakota, an outbreak last week led to the killing of 85,000 birds. An outbreak confirmed March 14 at a commercial operation in Wisconsin meant more than 2.7 million egg-laying chickens were killed. The latest data from the USDA show 59 confirmed sites of avian flu across commercial and backyard flocks in 17 states since the start of the year. That figure includes chickens, turkey and other poultry. The USDA identified a case of avian flu in a wild bird in mid-January, the first detection of the virus in wild birds in the U.S. since 2016. Wild birds can spread the virus to commercial and backyard flocks. By Feb. 9, the virus had been identified in a commercial flock in Indiana. There have since been hundreds of confirmed cases of wild birds infected with avian flu. The last major avian flu outbreak in the U.S. was from December 2014 to June 2015, when more than 50 million chickens and turkeys either died from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or were destroyed to stop its spread. During that outbreak, chicken breast prices increased 17%, according to agriculture data company Gro Intelligence. But at the same time, prices for cuts of chicken geared toward the export market actually dropped due to bans on importing U.S. poultry in countries including China, South Korea, Cuba and Mexico. So the cost of leg quarters, for instance, dropped 18%, according to the data. Poultry prices—especially for eggs and turkey—were affected for years, the company reports. The impact on prices this time depends on how widespread the flu becomes. Whether the 2022 avian flu will affect the price of eggs and poultry depends on how widespread it becomes, says Ron Kean, a poultry science expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences. \"In 2015, we did see quite an increase in egg prices,\" Kean told Wisconsin Public Radio. \"The chicken meat wasn't severely affected at that time. We did see quite a loss in turkeys, so turkey prices went up. So, we'll see. If a lot of farms contract this, then we could see some real increases in price.\" What's the risk to humans from this bird flu? Not much so far, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the CDC's most recent update on March 7, the H5N1 bird flu poses a low risk to the public, and is currently \"primarily an animal health issue.\" The CDC notes that some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection. You can't get avian flu from eating poultry or eating eggs that are properly prepared and cooked, the USDA explains. The chance of infected poultry entering the food chain is extremely low, the agency says, because of its food inspection program and avian flu response plan. \"All poultry products for public consumption are inspected for signs of disease both before and after slaughter,\" the USDA notes, and avian flu causes a rapid onset of symptoms in poultry. For producers who suspect their flock may be affected by avian flu, the USDA has a guide to the warning signs, including a sudden increase in bird deaths, lack of energy and appetite, and a decrease in egg production. If a flock is found to be infected by bird flu, the USDA moves quickly—within 24 hours—to assist producers to destroy the flock and prevent the virus from spreading.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 1}, {"key": "affirm_pandemic_statement_1", "statement": "What's the risk to humans from this bird flu?

One of the new outbreaks will lead to the killing of 1.5 million chickens at an egg-laying farm in Guthrie County, about 60 miles west of Des Moines. The other was at a turkey farm in Hamilton County, about 65 miles north of Des Moines, where 28,000 birds will be killed. After they are killed, birds typically are buried in compost pits on the farms. Iowa State Veterinarian Dr. Jeff Kaisand said it appears the infections are coming from migrating wild birds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says 17 states have had outbreaks in commercial or private outdoor flocks this year. The virus has been found in wild birds in at least 25 states. With the addition of the new Iowa cases, the U.S. poultry industry has had to kill more than 15.6 million chickens and 1.3 million turkeys since Jan. 1. In Iowa alone, infections have been found in seven commercial flocks and two backyard flocks. Iowa's agriculture secretary, Mike Naig, said the situation could worsen since the spring migration is likely to continue for a few more months. Much depends on the weather and improved biosecurity on farms, he said. Naig said it's too soon to estimate the economic loss this year. 'It's a difficult time for poultry producers, not just those that have an infected site,' he said. Food prices are already high due to inflation and supply chain problems, and if the bird flu outbreak expands to enough farms, chicken, turkey and egg prices could climb higher. Health officials say they don't know of any people who have caught the bird flu in the U.S., and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern. The virus can spread from infected birds to people, but such infections are rare and haven't led to sustained outbreaks among humans. The worst recent bird flu outbreak in the U.S. happened in 2015, when more than 230 farms in 15 states had outbreaks leading to the killing of over 50 million birds. The total economic loss has been valued at $3.3 billion, according to research published in 2019 by a group of Iowa State University scientists. In 2015, cases didn't surface in Iowa until mid-April.

Nearly 2 billion animals a year are now trucked and shipped around the world on journeys that can take weeks. We'll be exploring why this trade continues, the risk it poses to disease spread and why the EU has become such a key player.

We've also reported on the huge revenues generated by the industry, with the Middle East a key market. In 1988, the global trade in all live animals was worth $716m (£48m); by 2017 that had risen to $21bn. In 2016, Saudi Arabia alone imported almost $1bn worth of live animals, mostly sheep.

{"id": "4", "fulltext": "HONG KONG Sometimes history seems to unspool in a continuous playback loop. That is the feeling I get from watching Hongkongers donning face masks, dousing hands with sanitizer, and once again bracing for the possibility that a deadly new coronavirus outbreak originating in mainland China will spread here. Chinese authorities' delayed response, the secrecy breeding mistrust, the lack of full transparency, and efforts to control the narrative by downplaying the seriousness it all rings sadly familiar. Public health emergencies should be handled quickly, transparently, and devoid of political considerations. But public health is inherently political and, with anything involving China, politics can never be fully excised. For Chinese Communist officials, particularly at the provincial level, there is an innate tendency to cover up and conceal, their long-imbued penchant for secrecy always taking precedence over trifling concerns like promoting public awareness and advocating proper precautions. That was certainly the case in late 1997, just after China assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong, when the territory was hit by an outbreak of the H5N1 virus known as 'bird flu.' Well into the outbreak, with people sick and some dying, Hong Kong officials were reluctant to finger China as the source, even though 80% of the territory's poultry came from the mainland. Hong Kong ordered the slaughter of more than 1.3 million chickens, ducks, pigeons, and other birds, but officials were still nonsensically hesitant to point to China as the culprit behind the contagion out of fear of contradicting Beijing, which insisted strongly that all its chickens were healthy. Support STAT: STAT is offering coverage of the coronavirus for free. Please consider a subscription to support our journalism. Start free trial today. The same obfuscation and denial came from China's Communist authorities in reaction to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, also caused by a coronavirus, in late 2002 and 2003. Even as the virus spread, Chinese officials continued to undercount cases and delay reporting information to the World Health Organization. The government did not warn the public for months, allowing people carrying the virus to migrate freely, and did not alert the WHO until February 2003. China finally began concerted action in the summer of 2003 and SARS was quickly brought under control. But the inadequate reporting and delayed response led to a public health trust deficit that persists today. Like bird flu in 1997 and the SARS epidemic of 2002 to 2003, the newest coronavirus has originated in the mainland, this time in Wuhan, most likely in a market where exotic wild animals are sold. Like before, there are suspicions that in these early stages the number of confirmed cases were undercounted, underreported, or both. Like before, there were delays and denials, with Wuhan officials initially downplaying the virus as mild, treatable, and contained while dismissing the likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Those who disagreed online were questioned by police for spreading 'false rumors.' But 2020 is not 1997, nor even 2003. China's public health infrastructure and reporting system have become more reliable. Most importantly, internet use and penetration in China today makes it virtually impossible for a cover-up to last for long. Despite censorship of some news about the coronavirus including blocking foreign media websites social media platforms have been filled with debate, discussion, and questions from citizens asking what precautions they should take. State media has also made much of President Xi Jinping's instruction to local officials to open up about the number of cases and the severity of the epidemic or risk consequences. And WHO investigators and Hong Kong specialists have been allowed to visit Wuhan. Does this signal that Beijing is opting for a new policy of transparency this time? 'It's still very mixed,' said my colleague, King-wa Fu, who studies Chinese censorship patterns at the University of Hong Kong. 'We see censorship. But we also see a lot of discussion online. We'll have to wait and see.' The rapid spiral in the number of identified cases of infection with the coronavirus, and the new draconian measures taken, like effectively quarantining Wuhan at the start of the busy Lunar New Year travel period, breeds suspicion that the real picture may be far worse than officials even now admit. Even the quarantine smacks of too little, too late. It seems ill-planned, and likely to be largely ineffective. First there is the near impracticality of sealing off a city of 11 million people, larger than the populations of Hong Kong or New York City. The move was taken the day before the New Year's Eve travel period, when many people would have already started on their journeys. Planes, trains, and buses were halted, but it was unclear what provisions would be made for private cars. Perhaps most inexplicably, the ban was announced to take effect at 10 a.m. on a Thursday, creating an early-morning crush of travelers trying to get out ahead of the quarantine. Then there's the matter of whether such a closure of Wuhan could even be effective. Some public health experts I spoke with said there seems to have been no provision made for getting food, fuel, and critical supplies like medicine into the city, or how investigators, decision-makers, or even journalists would enter and whether they would then be permitted to leave. And while the closure might temporarily tamp down the geographical spread of the coronavirus apart from those residents who have already left it could also have the unintended effect of turning Wuhan into an incubator of infection. The Hong Kong government was already facing a loss of public confidence after months of protests sparked by Chief Executive Carrie Lam's botched extradition bill. Some pro-democracy lawmakers and ordinary citizens are accusing the government of dragging its feet on the virus crisis for fear of offending Beijing for example, not shutting down the West Kowloon rail terminus, and not immediately demanding arriving mainland train passengers fill out health declaration forms. Bird flu redux. For the Chinese Communist Party, which just celebrated 70 years in power, its legitimacy derives not from any election but from its performance. China's leaders base their right to rule on how effectively they have managed what is soon to be the world's largest economy.

{"id": "5", "fulltext": "HONG KONG—Chinese authorities announced Saturday a recurrence of avian influenza in chickens in central China, adding fresh economic concerns for a country reeling from an outbreak of coronavirus that has sickened nearly 12,000 people since it emerged in December. In a sign of the pressure already on China, Australia and Vietnam joined the U.S. and others in distancing their citizens from the country over the coronavirus, while Apple Inc. shut its stores on the Chinese mainland and Beijing pledged more support for embattled businesses. The Latest on the Coronavirus * Australia orders its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days * Vietnam halts all flights to and from Taiwan and China * Apple closes all of its retail stores in mainland China until Feb. 9 * Beijing pledges more support for its economy * Avian influenza adds to concerns about economy The avian influenza is likely to add to the economic damage rather than pose a major immediate health risk. China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that a case of H5N1 avian influenza, last identified in China in April last year, had killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. But while avian influenza can be fatal in humans, with a mortality rate of 60%, according to the World Health Organization, it doesn't spread easily to humans. In addition to the coronavirus, China has been grappling with an outbreak of African swine fever that has decimated the country's pig population over the past two years. Pork is China's main source of protein, and swine fever last year pushed overall consumer inflation to the highest level in eight years. Hunan province, where the avian influenza outbreak announced on Saturday took place, neighbors Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Australia said that it would impose new entry restrictions in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, banning foreign nationals who have been in mainland China in the past 14 days from entering Australia, while Qantas Airways Ltd., the country's national carrier, said it would suspend flights to the mainland starting Feb. 9. Vietnam's civil aviation authority said it would halt all flights to and from Taiwan and China, including the special Chinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong, starting Saturday. Several countries and airlines have suspended flights to China, including Pakistan, Italy and the U.S.'s American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. The move by Australia, which also ordered its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days, to tighten entry restrictions followed a U.S. tightening. A day earlier, the U.S. said it would deny entry to foreign nationals who had traveled anywhere in China within the past 14 days and imposed quarantines on Americans returning from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. The coronavirus has killed 259 people and infected nearly 12,000 in China as of late Friday, according to the official National Health Commission in Beijing. The number of infected patients in China alone now exceeds the global total for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed nearly 800 people after emerging from southern China in 2002 and 2003. Authorities in Beijing pledged more support for the economy in a bid to reassure investors before markets reopen on Monday. Companies and industries in regions hit particularly hard by the outbreak, including those that provide medical supplies, could get reduced lending rates, the central bank said in a joint statement with other government agencies, including the Finance Ministry and the banking regulator. China's cabinet said separately that products imported from the U.S. to control the outbreak will be exempt from punitive tariffs through March 31. Authorities also exempted tariffs and other taxes on products donated by overseas entities, according to a joint statement by the Finance Ministry and the customs agency. Resources are strained in Hubei province, and medical staff have been forced to turn away patients because of a lack of beds and basic medical supplies. Local authorities in Huanggang, a city about 35 miles east of Wuhan, imposed new restrictions on residents' movements, saying only one person per household in the city center would be allowed to go out every two days to purchase basic necessities. Apple is closing all of its retail stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb. 9 'out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts,' it said. The company operates more than 40 stores in China. North Korea said through its state media that it would send an aid fund to Chinese authorities, a rare extension of aid from Pyongyang. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, 'expressed deep consolation for the families who lost their blood relatives due to the infectious disease,' according to a report in Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency. North Korea—a close ally of China that has long been dependent on China's largess—was among the first countries to adopt stringent measures to keep the coronavirus outside its borders, and vowed to redouble its efforts. 'The novel coronavirus throws the world into uneasiness and horror, but the advantages and might of our state system—will be fully demonstrated to the whole world once again, when we ensure that the virus does not reach our country and that no one suffers from the infections,' it read.

{"id": "6", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — An infectious and fatal strain of bird flu has been confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in South Carolina, the first case of the more serious strain of the disease in the United States since 2017 and a worrisome development for an industry that was devastated by previous outbreaks. The high pathogenic case was found at an operation in Chesterfield County, South Carolina, marking the first case of the more dangerous strain since one found in a Tennessee chicken flock in 2017. In 2015, an estimated 50 million poultry had to be killed at operations mainly in the Upper Midwest after infections spread throughout the region. “Yes, it’s concerning when we see cases, but we are prepared to respond very quickly and that was done in this case,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The USDA has been working in recent months with scientists and farmers in North Carolina and South Carolina, where a low pathogenic — or less severe — strain of bird flu had been detected. Low pathogenic bird flu causes few clinical signs in infected birds. However, two strains of low pathogenic bird flu — the H5 and H7 strains — can mutate into highly pathogenic forms, which are frequently fatal to birds and easily transmissible between susceptible species. Low pathogenic cases were already in an area near the South Carolina and North Carolina state line and USDA was closely monitoring and testing. The case in Chesterfield County, South Carolina was expected to be another low pathogenic case, but it came back from the laboratory high pathogenic which means the less severe virus mutated into the more severe version, Cole said. “Our scientists at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory had looked at the virus characteristics of the low path virus and they had previously indicated that this was one that was probably likely to mutate so they were watching it very closely,” Cole said. A laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the virus that had been killing turkeys was a high pathogenic H7N3 strain of avian influenza. A report on the outbreak indicates it was discovered on April 6. It has killed 1,583 turkeys and the remainder of the 32,577 birds in the flock were euthanized. State officials quarantined the farm, movement controls were implemented and enhanced surveillance was already in place in the area. “The flock was quickly depopulated and will not enter the marketplace,” said Joel Brandenberger, president of the National Turkey Federation, an industry trade group. “Thorough disinfecting and cleaning procedures have already been initiated on premises as well as surveillance of commercial flocks in the surrounding area. This occurrence poses no threat to public health. Turkey products remain safe and nutritious.” He said poultry farmers implement strict biosecurity measures year-round and routinely test flocks for avian influenza. These measures were implemented after an H5N2 avian influenza outbreak that began in December 2014 swept commercial chicken, egg laying and turkey populations throughout much of 2015 killing 50 million birds and causing as much as $3 billion in economic damage. That outbreak is believed to have originated in wild birds. Nearly 90 percent of the bird losses were on egg-laying chicken farms in Iowa and turkey farms in Minnesota. The bulk of other cases occurred in the adjacent states of Nebraska, Wisconsin, and South Dakota. Cole said since 2015 significant planning, exercises and coordination has occurred between the federal government, state agencies and the industry. Cole said the coronavirus pandemic has not affected the ability of the government to respond to the bird flu. A highly pathogenic H7N9 bird flu strain was detected in Lincoln County, Tennessee, in a chicken flock of 73,500 birds in early March 2017. Ten days later samples from a commercial flock less than two miles away also tested positive for the same strain. The birds were euthanized and buried and the virus didn’t spread further indicating immediate mitigation action can stop spread.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 6}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 4}, {"key": "deny_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "This occurrence poses no threat to public health.

{"id": "7", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Here's a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds. There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called 'Influenza A (H5N1),' or the 'H5N1 virus.' Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu. The mortality rate is close to 60% for infected humans. Timeline Early 1900s -The avian flu is first identified in Italy. 1961 - The H5N1 strain is isolated in birds in South Africa.

{"id": "8", "fulltext": "Greg Langmo's decades-old business was among those hit when a lethal strain decimated poultry barns across America. In April 2015, Greg Langmo's five turkey farms teemed with toms, hens and chicks. His family's decades-old business in Meeker county, Minnesota, was thriving, and the hundreds of thousands of birds he bred and sold each year were healthy. And then, late one evening, Langmo's phone rang. Birds in one of his barns, usually active, were sitting, unable to make the short walk to their feeders and waterers. The following morning, he found hundreds of limp, white-feathered bodies. Langmo sent some dead toms to the University of Minnesota's veterinary diagnostic laboratory. That night, the farmer lay sleepless. Again, his phone rang. It was a vet from the lab: 'You got it.' Langmo's farms had been hit by the Eurasian/North American H5N2 strain of lethal avian influenza, which, along with another lethal strain, Eurasian H5N8, rampaged across poultry farms in the American west and midwest between December 2014 and June 2015. A third strain, Eurasian/North American H5N1, was detected in nearly 100 wild birds by US wildlife biologists. It was the first time a foreign strain of bird flu H5N8 had entered North America and mixed with mild bird flu viruses. It's one of many lethal bird flu outbreaks to kill billions of birds and cost billions of dollars over the past hundred years. Such losses are part of the reality of farming today. Lethal avian influenza's advent is strongly linked to the development of modern agriculture, which created a global network of disease incubators—industrial farms in some parts of the world, live animal markets in others—linked by trading routes, movement of labourers and equipment, and migration of wild birds. Critical diagnosis Soon after the diagnosis, says Langmo, 'the rest of the birds began dying by the bushel.' To stop the spread, Langmo and his employees killed survivors with a swift crack to the back of the head. Within three days, virtually all 11,000 toms in the infected barn were dead. Then they moved into the other barns. Workers from the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) arrived and doused any live birds with water-based foam, an asphyxiant used to mass-euthanise poultry in emergencies only. Foam flowed across the floors, bubbling like a choppy sea, the turkeys beneath it gasping for air. Fifteen minutes later, all were dead. Only other poultry farmers will know the helpless feeling of losing a great flock of birds, Greg Langmo reflected. He lost 225,000 turkeys across five farms. Langmo was one of 211 American commercial poultry farmers who battled bird flu during the 2014-15 outbreak, the worst the $40bn (£1bn) US poultry industry has experienced. Twenty-one flocks on backyard farms were diagnosed and destroyed. Nationwide, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys died from the virus or were killed to control it. American commercial poultry farmers lost about $1.6bn. The US poultry industry lost an estimated $3.3bn. 'This outbreak was arguably the most significant animal health event in US history,' says Dr Julie Gauthier, assistant director for poultry health at USDA-APHIS. Deadly history Lethal bird flu, originally 'fowl plague,' was first diagnosed on Italian farms in 1878. While poultry die-offs reported before 1878 may have been bird flu, this was the first time scientists distinguished the virus from bacterial poultry diseases, such as fowl cholera. Subsequent research revealed that bird flu is an influenza-A virus. These viruses are rarely lethal and often mildly afflict their natural hosts. But lethal influenza-A viruses, which mutate in and emerge from the bodies of domesticated animals, are known to infect and kill not just poultry, but birds, horses, swine, bats, dogs and even humans. The emergence and coexistence of three hybrid lethal bird flu strains—H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8—in the US during the 2014-2015 pandemic underscores the ability of influenza-A viruses to rapidly mix, transform, infect and persist. Lethal bird flu viruses have emerged more frequently as poultry farms have expanded capacities and quickened animal-rearing rates over the past 50 years. In the 37 years from 1959 to 1995, these viruses emerged 14 times globally, about one outbreak every 2.6 years; while in the 13 years from 1996 to 2008, they arose 11 times, about one outbreak every 1.2 years. These species don't mix Scientists and farmers are divided over the best way forward. In terms of prevention, should birds be kept inside, which would reduce potential contact with wild birds? Should large-scale movement of animals (industrial farming depends on the transportation of large populations of birds after breeding and for slaughter) be scaled down? That is one of the key vectors by which the disease may be spread. Some regions of the world look to good farm hygiene and high levels of biosecurity, where infected birds are confined and killed to eradicate disease; others, particularly in countries with many outdoor industrial farms, struggle with implementing biosecurity and may lack available veterinary care, so they allow diseases to circulate, using vaccines to reduce illness and mortality. 'Vaccines do not prevent birds from becoming infected with the avian influenza virus or from producing and shedding the virus into the environment,' says Gauthier, adding that up until now culling birds was the preferred solution in the US. Constant threat Gene Baur, president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary, a UK-based animal protection organisation, believes that establishing a network of small farms serving local communities is one powerful possibility, because it reduces the need for transporting animals, farm labourers and equipment. Scientists are recognising the benefits of giving birds more space—research shows chickens stressed by overcrowded living conditions typical to commercial farms have diminished immunity to disease. After a major avian influenza outbreak in Thailand from 2004 to 2005, experts determined that industrial farms were more likely to be infected than backyard farms. In the Netherlands, after a 2003 outbreak, scientists suggested that thinning commercial flocks could prevent the next epidemic. When you confine animals in these filthy conditions they become breeding grounds for disease, Gene Baur, Farm Sanctuary, says. 'When you confine animals in these filthy, crowded, stressful conditions, just like humans, they become breeding grounds for disease,' says Baur. After considering his financial losses from the 2014-2015 pandemic, Langmo spent a year rebuilding his business, downsizing from five farms to two. He says he's boosted biosecurity by cutting cross-traffic, checking birds' health more frequently and improving sanitation with routine deep-cleanings. 'After a thorough sanitisation, each barn literally needs to be as clean as your kitchen, no feathers, no nothing,' says Langmo. 'It's very expensive.'

The outbreaks have been found in wild bird populations and two broiler chicken farms, where all the birds are being culled. Farmers are required to restrict access for non-essential people, remove sources of wild bird food and ensure workers are regularly disinfecting footwear and changing clothes. Those found to not be complying face up to three months in prison or unlimited fines, according to the measures announced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). UK and European farmers have been on alert after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. When bird flu was detected in the same area of Russia in the summers of 2005 and 2016, epidemics followed in northern and eastern Europe. However, the speed of the spread of outbreaks in Europe over the past few weeks has caught the industry by surprise, with hundreds of thousands of birds culled after multiple outbreaks across Germany and the Netherlands. Thousands of dead wild birds were also reportedly found on the north-west coast of Germany last week, most likely infected with bird flu. British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said bird flu was a significant threat to the commercial poultry industry and he supported new restrictive measures to minimise the risk of a larger and wider outbreak. It is an incredibly difficult situation for farmers and producers if they get a case of avian influenza (AI), so the controls and their costs are made to be as fair as they can be. For instance, farmers are compensated for the culling of healthy birds as part of AI controls. The system is as fair as it possibly can be, given the nature of the situation. During the last significant bird flu outbreak in 2016/17, there was also a ban on keeping poultry outdoors. Defra said this was not being considered at present, but would be if the outbreak spread further. Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and that properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. PHE said: Our advice regarding contact with wild birds remains the same make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after coming into contact with any animal and do not touch any sick or dead birds.

{"id": "12", "fulltext": "Virus causing high levels of mortality in birds, with risk to chickens and other poultry A spate of baffling swan deaths is strongly suspected to be caused by a virulent new strain of avian flu sweeping across Britain. Dying swans were found spinning in circles and discharging blood from their nostrils on Ulverston canal, Cumbria. Swan rescuers have taken in more than 25 dying birds in Worcestershire and nine swans were found dead in Stanley Park, Blackpool. Postmortem examinations have confirmed that six black swans and cygnets that died in Dawlish, Devon, had contracted the latest strain of bird flu, H5N8. Brought in by wild birds migrating across Europe, the strain last caused widespread avian deaths in the winter of 2016-17. The risk to human health from the virus is very low, according to Public Health England. Fears are growing that the virus will wipe out chickens and other poultry this winter, with outbreaks already confirmed among captive birds in Kent, Cheshire, Leicestershire, and chickens at a broiler breeding farm in Herefordshire. The government has declared an avian influenza prevention zone across England, Scotland and Wales, requiring all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures. While the virus is particularly visible in swans and large wildfowl, other wild bird deaths confirmed this month include pink-footed geese, greylag geese, Canada geese, buzzards and curlews. Dr Ruth Cromie, a research fellow at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, said: 'Wild birds are often seen as evil vectors, but they are victims of a virus which originally spread from poultry. Wild birds get used as scapegoats for poor biosecurity and people moving chickens around the globe.' She said avian flu, like all influenza viruses, regularly mutates, and there are either genetic or environmental factors making it particularly pathogenic this year. The virus disrupts the nervous system and can cause neurological symptoms in birds, such as head-twitching, stumbling and swimming in circles. Cromie added: 'We can be sure it is causing high levels of mortality this year.' Caroline Sim, of Flying Free, a volunteer operation to protect and rescue swans in Ulverston, said she had never seen such strange symptoms in the family of 10 swans there that died of bird flu. 'Many of them started to spin on their axis in one direction. It was terrible to see. Some of them were discharging from their nostrils and some of it was bloody,' she said. The dead birds were collected by officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to be tested. David Cash, of Worcester Swan Rescue, said about 25 swans had died. 'The swans were looking lethargic and not wanting food, and doing a lot of coughing – similar to the symptoms of Covid.' The government's prevention zone obliges all bird keepers to take measures to discourage mixing between captive and wild birds, such as feeding and watering their birds in enclosed areas, and removing wild bird food sources from around captive birds. Experts noticed an unusually high level of avian flu in Russia during the summer, and this has been spread across Europe by wild species, such as swans and geese, during their westward migration for the winter. Christine Middlemiss, the UK chief veterinary officer, repeated the Food Standards Agency advice that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for consumers. She added: 'Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to meet enhanced biosecurity requirements and this is in your interests to do, to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.' Cromie said that while improving biosecurity was the best short-term solution, the authorities should be looking at how these viruses originate in and are amplified by industrial meat production. Britain slaughters more than 1 billion chickens every year. She said: 'We should not be looking to put every chicken in a house, but asking: do we really need to have that many chickens? We're creating these nutty industrialised production systems that create a variety of health problems.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 8}, {"key": "affirm_keyword_statement_1", "statement": "The swans were looking lethargic and not wanting food, and doing a lot of coughing – similar to the symptoms of Covid."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 7}]}
{"id": "13", "fulltext": "Eggs can continue to be labelled free-range for 16 weeks and poultry meat for 12 weeks, says Defra. Millions of free-range hens and other birds will have to be kept indoors from 14 December, in a national government crackdown to try to limit the spread of a virulent strain of avian flu across Great Britain. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a statement that the chief vets of England, Scotland and Wales had agreed the new legal requirement for all birdkeepers to bring their flocks indoors, to keep them separate from potentially infectious wild birds. The strict new lockdown-style measures, which have already been introduced in the Netherlands, apply not only to large commercial poultry farms but also smaller keepers with hens in coops or garden pens. Keepers are being urged to use the next 11 days to prepare for the new measures, including taking steps to safeguard animal welfare, consult their vet and where necessary erect additional housing or self-contained netted areas. Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as free-range for 16 weeks after the birds have been brought indoors, but if the restrictions last beyond that they must be downgraded to barn produced using stickers on packaging. Similarly, poultry meat can be labelled free-range for 12 weeks. To be defined as free range in the UK, a chicken must normally be at least 56 days old before slaughter and have had access to outside space for at least half that time. Premium free-range eggs currently represent 56% of UK retail egg sales – the highest proportion of any European country – whereas just 2% of eggs are from the barn system. Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser with the National Farmers' Union, urged all farmers to comply with the new rules. Due to a number of confirmed avian influenza cases, the introduction of these new housing measures is a logical next step to best protect poultry. These new measures mean that every poultry keeper, whether you have one hen in the garden or a large poultry business, must house their birds indoors and I would urge everyone with poultry to take these measures seriously. It's crucial that everyone remains vigilant and reports any signs of disease in their birds at the earliest opportunity. On Sunday, all 10,500 turkeys at a farm in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, were culled after an outbreak was spotted on Saturday, while a 3km (2-mile) and 10km temporary control zone was put in place to stop the disease spreading. About 13,500 birds were culled earlier this month following confirmation of an avian flu outbreak at a commercial farm in Helsby, near Frodsham in Cheshire. Defra reiterated that the risk to human health and food safety from the virus was very low. UK and European farmers have been on alert after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. In a joint statement, Great Britain's three chief vets said: We have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease and are now planning to introduce a legal requirement for bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds. We have not taken this decision lightly, but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease. A spokesman for the British Egg Industry Council said: To date there have been no cases of avian flu in free-range laying flocks; however it is vital that we continue to protect the health and welfare of the UK's laying flock and commercial poultry operations. The requirement to keep birds inside from 14 December is a further step to those already taken to continue to protect flocks. It is the first time in four years that a so-called housing order has been imposed on the UK poultry sector due to a significant outbreak of bird flu, when measures were put in place from December 2016 to May 2017. A spokesman for Compassion in World Farming said: We understand the reasons for bringing poultry indoors, but would urge that the period be kept as short as possible and that steps are taken to ensure the welfare of birds temporarily confined indoors.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 9}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_8", "statement": "We have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease and are now planning to introduce a legal requirement for bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 5}]}

The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) announced earlier this month that the chief vets of England, Scotland and Wales had agreed the new legal requirement for all owners to bring their flocks indoors, to keep them separate from potentially infectious wild birds. It applies not only to large commercial poultry farms but also smaller farmers with hens in coops or garden pens. Lockdown and the shift towards 'self-sufficiency' has triggered a huge surge in interest by individuals in keeping birds and there is concern that many may have scant regard or understanding of the importance of biosecurity measures. The restrictions will apply to chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants. No end date for the measures has yet been given, and Defra said they would be kept under 'regular review.' Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as 'free-range' for 16 weeks from today, but if restrictions last longer they must be downgraded to 'barn produced' using stickers on packaging. Similarly, poultry meat can be labelled free-range for 12 weeks.

Among commercial producers preparing for the new restrictions is Alastaire Brice, who runs Havensfield Happy Hens—currently with 160,000 laying hens in 22 flocks across farms in Norfolk and Suffolk. The current lockdown comes as no surprise, Brice told the East Anglian Daily Times: 'It's expected, bearing in mind the sporadic cases that have been going on up and down the country. Last year, they had a reprieve when bird flu didn't arrive in the country but this year it started with a bang.' It can take longer to get older flocks to adjust to coming indoors, he explained, with hens vulnerable to anxiety or aggression. Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said: 'While contingency plans are in place and the spread of bird flu is being effectively monitored, the combination of avian influenza, the coronavirus pandemic, and a tight, non-negotiable Brexit deadline, has proven yet again the vulnerability of Britain's food security.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "Millions of free-range hens and other birds must be kept indoors from Monday under a national government crackdown to try to curtail the spread of a virulent strain of avian flu sweeping across Great Britain."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 0}]}
{"id": "15", "fulltext": "CAIRO (AP) — Local authorities in rural Egypt have declared a state of emergency after detecting two outbreaks of bird flu. Nagy Awad, head of the veterinary agency in the southwestern province of al-Wadi al-Gedid, said Sunday that avian influenza was detected in two poultry farms in the villages of Ezab el-Qasr and Oweina in the Dakhla Oasis, located over 750 kilometers (470 miles) from the capital, Cairo. He said the infected birds were culled and authorities have carried out medical examinations of people who were in contact with them. The virus, which is mainly spread through contact with infected animals, can cause severe illness or death in humans. Egypt suffered a major outbreak of bird flu in 2006 that led to the suspension of all poultry exports. Authorities have been pressing to renew them, and earlier this year, the World Organization for Animal Health, an intergovernmental body, had declared Egypt free of bird flu for the first time in 14 years. The H5N1 strain of bird flu spread in early 2000s in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, leading to the slaughter of tens of millions of chickens and ducks. Hundreds of people were infected, many of whom died, according to the World Health Organization. Egypt is at high risk because many of its poultry farms are in residential areas. Many Egyptians also raise pigeons and chickens at home to supplement their income. Even in dense urban areas, birds are kept on rooftops, balconies and courtyards.

{"id": "16", "fulltext": "India has begun culling tens of thousands of poultry birds after avian influenza was detected in ducks, crows and wild geese in at least a dozen locations across the country. The country's Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying issued an alert on Wednesday, urging states to take measures to avoid any further spread of the disease. The southern state of Kerala ordered the culling of more than 38,000 poultry birds on Tuesday after reports of dead birds infected with the disease emerged in two districts, according to the state's Minister for Animal Husbandry, K. Raju. \"Nineteen rapid response teams have been formed for this,\" Raju said. About 17,000 birds have been culled in Kerala so far, and eggs have also been destroyed in some districts. The northern state of Himachal Pradesh reported the death of more than 3,000 birds from the disease, mostly bar-headed geese at a wildlife sanctuary, according to Archana Sharma, a senior official in the state forest department. \"The birds affected are migratory birds. All we can do is follow the strategy of clearing up the area of contamination. We comb the entire area of the sanctuary and we physically send 10 teams every day who search for any dead birds and dispose of them,\" Sharma said. The alert comes as India continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 10.3 million people in the country, and is about to embark on one of the most ambitious mass vaccination programs ever undertaken. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually only affects birds. There are many different strains, but the most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called Influenza A (H5N1), or the H5N1 virus. In India, the disease spreads mostly through migratory birds entering the country during the winter season. Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. There have been no reports of avian flu transmitting to people in India so far during this outbreak. \"There is no need to panic,\" Minister of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Giriraj Singh, told public service broadcaster Doordarshan on Wednesday. \"We also provide compensation to farmers for the birds that have to be culled.\" Other countries in Asia have also experienced outbreaks of bird flu this winter. In November, hundreds of thousands of chickens were culled in Japan after cases of avian flu were detected in poultry. A farm in the city of Hiroshima culled 134,000 chickens after avian flu was detected for the first time on its premises since 2004.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 4}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 8}, {"key": "deny_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "There is no need to panic,"}, {"key": "deny_pandemic_statement_1", "statement": "There is no need to panic,"}]}

French producers of foie gras have called for a mass preventive cull of ducks to try to halt the spread of a severe strain of bird flu that is ripping through poultry farms in the south-west of the country. The highly pathogenic H5N8 virus was first detected in a bird in a pet shop on the Mediterranean island of Corsica in November before spreading to duck farms on the mainland in December. Several European countries have reported cases of infection, five years after a major outbreak prompted the slaughter of millions of ducks in France. \"The virus is stronger than us. New clusters are constantly emerging,\" the head of France's CIFOQ federation of foie gras producers, Marie-Pierre Pe, told Agence France-Presse. The number of outbreaks in France had now risen to 124, the ministry of agriculture said on Thursday, adding that about 350,000 ducks had been slaughtered since 24 December. Earlier this week the government's chief veterinary officer, Loic Evain, said more than 200,000 ducks had already been slaughtered and that a further 400,000 birds were set to be culled, out of about 35 million reared each year. He described the virus, which is not harmful to humans, as \"very, very contagious.\" Officials in Belgium said on Thursday they had culled three contaminated poultry flocks: one in Menin, in the west of the country, another in Dinant in the south and a third in Dixmude in western Flanders. Belgium's federal food safety agency AFSCA, which has ordered poultry owners to lock up their animals to avoid contamination, said that 20 cases of the virus had been found in wild birds. Herve Dupouy, a French producer who heads the local poultry section of the FNSEA farmers federation in the Landes department, a bastion of the foie gras industry, said \"The situation is out of control.\" He called on the state to cull all poultry flocks in the area and impose a two-month production freeze. \"There's no other solution,\" he said. So far the authorities have been culling all ducks and geese within a three-kilometre radius of an infected flock. Free-range chickens and turkeys within that range have also been slaughtered. CIFOQ said on Thursday that government officials had shared plans to expand the culls over a wider area. The bird flu clusters have been detected on poultry farms and in pet shops in the Landes department and the neighbouring Gers and Pyrenees-Atlantique departments. The head of France's chamber of agriculture, Sebastien Windsor, called on Wednesday for \"radical measures\" to try to restore confidence in export markets such as China which announced this week it was suspending French poultry imports over the virus. Producers of foie gras, a pate made from the livers of force-fed ducks or geese, fear a repeat of the devastation wrought by two previous waves of bird flu in the winters of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. More than 25m ducks were culled in the first outbreak, followed by 4.5m the following year, causing a steep decline in foie gras production. Besides France and Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain and Ireland have also reported bird flu outbreaks since the winter began. Dutch authorities culled 190,000 chickens in November after the discovery of the virus at two farms. Outbreaks have also been reported in India and South Korea. In India, tens of thousands of poultry will be slaughtered after an outbreak of deadly avian influenza was found to have killed scores of birds across the country. At least six Indian states have stepped up efforts this week to contain two strains of bird flu H5N1 and H5N8 after the deaths of thousands of migratory birds, ducks, crows and chickens.

{"id": "18", "fulltext": "Seven poultry workers found to be infected, but no evidence of transmission between humans A H5N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, among seven workers who were infected at a Russian poultry plant in December. There is no evidence of the strain being transmitted between humans, but Russia has reported the transmission to the World Health Organization. The workers now feel well, and the situation did not develop further according to Dr Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor. She said the workers had been infected during an outbreak of the strain at the plant. Outbreaks of the strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East and north Africa in recent months, but only in poultry. Other strains of bird flu, including H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2, have been transmitted to humans before. The H5N8 strain is deadly for birds, and this marks the first transmission of the strain from animals to humans. While Popova said the strain didn’t appear to be able to spread among humans, only time will tell how soon future mutations will allow it to overcome this barrier. The discovery of this strain gives us all, the whole world, time to prepare for possible mutations and the possibility to react in a timely way and develop test systems and vaccines, she said. The Vector Institute in Siberia said on Saturday that it would start developing human tests and a vaccine against H5N8, according to RIA news agency. Speaking on state TV, Popova said that Russia had reported the developments to the WHO several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results. Most cases of human bird flu infections have been linked to direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered safe. The cases tend to be spread via migrating wild birds, leading producing countries to keep their poultry indoors or segregated from wildlife. Outbreaks of bird flu often lead poultry plants to kill their birds to prevent the virus spreading further, and often prompts other countries to impose trade restrictions. In the UK, five outbreaks of the H5N8 strain in Gloucestershire, Dorset, Devon, Cheshire and Kent were detected in November, leading officials to implement a prevention zone in England, Scotland and Wales.

{"id": "20", "fulltext": "Covid fuels the current virus pandemic, but the world is full of flu viruses waiting in the wings. And they keep changing unpredictably. When a bird flu virus struck a major poultry farm in Russia earlier this year, it was a reminder that the coronavirus causing the pandemic was not the only dangerous virus out there. The authorities quickly tested the birds and moved into high gear, killing 800,000 chickens, disposing of the carcasses and cleaning the farm to stop the potential spread to other chicken farms. But they were also concerned for humans. They tested the birds and sequenced the virus, determining that it was the H5N8 strain of avian flu, highly dangerous to both wild and domestic birds. It is established in Asia and has been increasingly causing deadly outbreaks in birds in Europe. H5N8 viruses have infected some poultry flocks in the United States, but the viruses come from a different though related lineage of virus, distinct from the current H5N8 viruses in Asia and Europe. Flu viruses combine and mutate frequently in unpredictable ways. In the short period from Dec. 25, 2020, to Jan. 14 of this year, more than seven million birds were lost to H5N8 outbreaks in Europe and Asia. Europe alone had 135 outbreaks among poultry and 35 among wild birds. Of course, to put the numbers in context, humans consume about 65 billion chickens each year, and one estimate puts the number of chickens on the globe at any one time at 23 billion. As damaging as H5N8 has been to birds, it had never infected people. Until February. The Russian health authorities also tested about 200 of the people involved in the cleanup of the farm in Astrakhan, using nasal swabs and later blood tests for antibodies. They reported that for the first time, H5N8 had jumped to people. Seven of the workers appeared to have been infected with the virus, although none of them became ill. Only one of those seven cases, however, was confirmed by genetically sequencing the virus. Nonetheless, the potential danger of the new virus and its jump to humans set off alarm bells for Dr. Daniel R. Lucey, a physician and a specialist in pandemics at Georgetown University. He began writing about the Astrakhan event in a blog for other infectious disease experts as soon as it was publicized. He reported that during a television interview, a Russian public health official said the H5N8 virus was likely to evolve into human-to-human transmission. That possibility was frightening. 'The W.H.O. finally put out a report Feb. 26,' he said. But it did not frame the event as particularly alarming because the virus was not causing human disease, and the report judged the risk of human-to-human transmission as low, despite the Russian official's comment. To Dr. Lucey, no one else seemed to be taking the infection of humans with H5N8 as 'of any concern.' He added, 'I think it's of concern.' Other scientists said they were not as worried. Dr. Florian Krammer, a flu researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, said he was more concerned about other avian flu viruses like H5N1 that have already shown themselves to be dangerous to people. Another avian influenza virus, H7N9, infected people for the first time in 2013. There have been more than 1,500 confirmed cases and more than 600 deaths since then. Since 2017 there have been only three confirmed cases and the virus does not jump easily from person to person. It is always possible that any virus can evolve human-to-human transmission, as well as become more dangerous. But H5N8 would have both hurdles to jump. Compared to other viral threats, Dr. Krammer said, 'I'm not worried.' Dr. Richard J. Webby, a flu specialist at the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and director of the W.H.O.'s Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that all of the H5 viruses are of concern because some of them have infected and killed people. But, he said, 'They all have the same sort of binding capacity to human cells, which is limited,' he said. Flu viruses use a slightly different way to attach to cells in birds than to cells in humans and being good at one usually means not being good at the other. Dr. Webby also said that while seven infections would certainly be of concern, only one infection has been confirmed. The tests of the other six involved nasal swabs and blood antibody tests. In people with no symptoms, he said, nasal swabs can simply indicate that they had breathed in virus. That would not mean it had infected them. Blood antibody tests also have a potential for error, he said, and may not be able to distinguish exposure to one flu virus from another. Nor did he see any scientific basis for suggesting that H5N8 is more likely than any other bird flu to evolve human-to-human transmission. But any virus could evolve that ability. Dr. Lucey said that he was heartened to see that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had prepared a candidate vaccine for H5N8 before it had infected humans. Candidate vaccines are simply first steps in planning for potential problems, and have not been through any testing. They exist for many viruses. 'Humans should be routinely tested for the virus, right at the time of the outbreak in birds,' Dr. Lucey said. He favors the protocol followed in Astrakhan, and argues that for any outbreak among birds, public health authorities should test people who are exposed to sick birds with nasopharyngeal swabs and an antibody test, followed by other antibody tests a few weeks later. An upcoming editorial in the journal Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease also takes up the Astrakhan incident and calls for increased monitoring of all H5 viruses.

The 41-year-old man in Jiangsu province, northwest of Shanghai, was hospitalized April 28 and is in stable condition, the National Health Commission said on its website. No human case of H10N3 has been reported elsewhere, the commission said. “This infection is an accidental cross-species transmission,” its statement said. “The risk of large-scale transmission is low.” The news comes amid heightened awareness of the threat of emerging diseases as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to claim lives around the world. But unlike with coronaviruses, there are global influenza surveillance systems that watch for human cases of bird flu, since a strain named H5N1 cropped up in the late 1990s in Hong Kong’s crowded live-poultry markets. Between 2013 and 2017, another bird flu named H7N9 infected more than 1,500 people in China through close contact with infected chickens. With that history, authorities aren’t surprised to see occasional human cases of various bird flu strains and they monitor closely for any signs one is spreading between people.

{"id": "22", "fulltext": "A man in eastern China may be the first confirmed human case of infection with the H10N3 strain of bird flu, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said Tuesday. The 41-year-old man from Jiangsu province, located northwest of Shanghai, was hospitalized April 28 after developing fever and other symptoms. He was diagnosed with the infection on May 28, according to Reuters, but is now stable and ready to be discharged from the hospital. The health commission said the infection was a result of accidental cross-species transmission. The risk of widespread transmission is low, Chinese officials said, and there are no other human cases of H10N3 reported elsewhere in the world. Avian influenza Type A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds and have been found in more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While these viruses don't normally infect humans, birds can shed virus in their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC says. Human infections can occur if enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth. The CDC says two strains of bird flu viruses have been mostly responsible for human infection and mortality: H7N9 and H5N1. Symptoms of avian influenza A virus infections can range from mild to severe and include conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness such as fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches. Symptoms can also be accompanied by nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and severe respiratory illness, according to the CDC. While it's possible for some of these viruses to jump from birds to humans, they so far don't have the capability of transmitting between humans, said Jürgen Richt, a professor at Kansas State University and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases with the National Institutes of Health. Alpha, Beta, Delta: WHO renames COVID-19 variants with Greek letter names to avoid confusion, stigma COVID origins: Biden tells intelligence agencies to step up probe of COVID-19's origins, including theory of Wuhan lab leak 'This is our biggest fear,' said Richt, who also directs the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases for the Department of Homeland Security. 'If they were to transmit human to human, then we would be at a worse situation than COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates.' This is because bird flu strains can be particularly deadly among human populations. According to the World Health Organization, the case-fatality rate of H7N9 is roughly 30%; H5N1 is 60%. It may be unlikely the H10N3 strain can transmit between humans, Richt said, but scientists can't know for sure until they learn its genetic code and conduct epidemiological surveillance to determine if any other contacts were infected. 'The reason for that is that avian influenza viruses spread among avian species using different receptors than mammalian influenza viruses,' he said. 'In order for these viruses to transmit (among humans), the virus needs to adapt. There're several adaptation steps and, so far, this has not happened with avian flu viruses.'

{"id": "23", "fulltext": "The Chinese government announced Tuesday that a man in Jiangsu province, northwest of Shanghai, had become the first person known to have been infected with the H10N3 strain of bird flu. In a statement, China's National Health Commission emphasized that there was no evidence that the strain had the ability to spread among humans, adding that the risk of a significant outbreak was 'very low.' The patient, a 41-year-old man who lives in the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalized April 28 after having fever symptoms, the National Health Commission said. He was diagnosed with H10N3 a month later. Though the man remains under medical supervision, his condition was described as stable and meeting the standards for discharge. It was not clear from the statement how he caught the virus. The news of the H10N3 infection comes amid the devastation of the covid-19 pandemic, which also was first identified in China and is widely thought to have come to humans from bats through some form of zoonotic spread. A different strain of bird flu, known as H7N9, led to the deaths of around 300 people during an outbreak between 2016 and 2017. But varieties of avian influenza are common in China and, due to increased surveillance of the viruses, relatively easy to find in humans. Unlike in H7N9, there is no evidence that H10N3 can spread easily among humans. 'The more we look for novel viruses as a cause of illness among patients the more we are likely to find them,' Gregory Gray, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Duke University, told the South China Morning Post. Alexandra Phelan, a global health lawyer at Georgetown University's Center for Global Health Science and Security, wrote on Twitter that people should be 'alert but not alarmed' about the news, adding that spillover between species did not itself mean there was epidemic risk. China's National Health Commission also said that H10N3 caused less severe illness among birds. Chinese authorities placed all the man's close contacts under medical observation and said the contacts did not display any 'abnormalities.'

A 41-year-old man in China's eastern Jiangsu Province is the first known human to be infected with a strain of bird flu known as H10N3, China's National Health Commission said on Tuesday—a development that experts said merited close monitoring because of an underlying continued risk of pandemic flus. Avian viruses do not typically spread among humans, but they can pose a danger if they mix with a human virus, said Raina MacIntyre, the head of the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Australia. 'If someone has human flu and is infected with bird flu, the two viruses can swap genetic material,' she said. 'That's why you see the concern for pandemic flu arising in countries where humans and livestock have very close contact.' The Health Commission's announcement said that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission in the Jiangsu case. Contact tracing and surveillance have not uncovered any other infections, officials said. Influenza viruses differ from coronaviruses, and the World Health Organization is working with the Chinese government to monitor the case, according to a statement from the W.H.O. division in Beijing.

The government announcement did not say how the man had been infected, and the W.H.O. said the source of infection was still unknown. The man's condition has stabilized, and he is ready to be discharged, the government said. Professor MacIntyre said that usually the people infected by avian viruses are those who are in prolonged close contact with the birds, such as poultry handlers. The W.H.O. said that H10N3 had 'been detected periodically in birds in live bird markets as early as 2002,' but that the virus was unlikely to kill birds or lead to many signs of illness.

{"id": "27", "fulltext": "Chinese health authorities said a 41-year-old man had contracted a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3 and had been in the hospital since late April, calling it the first reported human case globally from the strain. The National Health Commission said the man developed a fever and other symptoms on April 23 and was admitted to hospital in Jiangsu province five days later. On Tuesday the health commission said his condition was stable and indicated he was ready to be discharged. How did the man become infected? The health commission didn't give details on how the man came into contact with the virus. Cases of bird flu in humans have most commonly been reported among those in close daily contact with poultry, such as chicken farmers. The commission advised the public to avoid contact with sick and dead poultry. Can bird flu kill people? Avian influenza can be fatal in humans. Highly pathogenic strains, such as H5N1, can have a mortality rate of about 60%, according to the World Health Organization. However, the WHO says, bird flu doesn't spread easily from birds to people. How common are bird-flu outbreaks in China? China has seen several outbreaks of bird flu, including one at the height of the coronavirus outbreak last year, when H5N1 avian influenza killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. In May, China's Agriculture Ministry said the H5N8 strain of bird flu killed hundreds of wild birds in Tibet, prompting authorities to disinfect areas including a national wetland park. Are authorities worried? China said the risk of a large-scale outbreak was extremely low. It said local health authorities' contact-tracing and monitoring efforts had found no other cases and no human-to-human transmission. It said the H10N3 strain doesn't have the ability to effectively infect humans. What do experts say? Human infections with bird-flu viruses are rare but not uncommon, said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, a professor at the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. 'It is highly likely that this infection just represents one of the rare incidents of human infection with an avian influenza virus, without any more consequences,' said Prof. Garcia-Sastre. 'Nevertheless, it's important to make sure that this is just that, a rare isolated incident.' The fact that the case happened in April and there hasn't been any other reports of cases suggests there hasn't been a cluster of infections, says Peng Shifang, a professor of infectious diseases at Central South University in China's Hunan province. Is China upfront about the recent bird-flu case? China said it had determined on May 28 through genome sequencing that the man suffered from the H10N3 strain. It issued its statement on the results on Tuesday. While China has been criticized for a lack of transparency in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, its public-health apparatus is generally seen as having become more transparent since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, when official secrecy hampered the response.

A man has been hospitalized in southwestern China after contracting the H5N6 strain of avian flu, Chinese state news media reported on Thursday, a reminder that the world is full of flu viruses even during a coronavirus pandemic. The man, 55, was hospitalized in Bazhong, a city in the southwestern province of Sichuan, after coming down with a fever and testing positive for the virus on July 6, the state-run China Global Television Network reported. Local officials had activated an emergency response and sterilized the area, the broadcaster said in a brief report in English. It cited unnamed experts as saying that the risk of large-scale transmission among humans was low. The report did not provide other details or say whether the man handled poultry as part of his job. The H5N6 virus is one of several potentially dangerous flu versions that scientists have reported finding over the years in poultry flocks or in captured or dead wild birds. It was first detected eight years ago in Laos, and later spread to China and other countries. As of last week, 32 confirmed cases of human infection with the H5N6 virus, and 19 deaths, had been reported to the World Health Organization in Asia since 2014, according to the agency. The last human case before the one from Sichuan Province had an onset date of May 13. Because flu viruses mutate a lot in nature, scientists try to monitor them closely for signs that they are becoming more contagious or deadly. Last year in China, for example, a team of scientists reported that a new strain of the H1N1 swine flu virus was spreading silently in workers on the country's pig farms and should be urgently controlled to avoid another pandemic, even though the strain had not caused disease in the people it infected.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 6}, {"key": "affirm_keyword_statement_1", "statement": "a reminder that the world is full of flu viruses even during a coronavirus pandemic."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 8}]}
{"id": "29", "fulltext": "Bird keepers required to follow strict biosecurity measures after outbreaks in poultry in Dundee and Wrexham. A bird flu prevention zone has been declared across Great Britain to stop the spread of the disease among poultry and other birds. Since 5pm on Wednesday, all bird keepers have been legally required to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks. On Wednesday a flock of poultry was culled near Dundee in Scotland after a bird flu outbreak. Earlier this week cases were detected in wild birds and poultry in Wrexham, Wales. The disease has been detected in wild birds at multiple sites across Great Britain. Bird flu circulates naturally among wild birds, and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe in winter the disease can be spread to poultry and other captive birds. In advice published on the Defra website, UK health agencies and food standards agencies say the risk to public health from the virus is very low. According to the NHS, bird flu can affect humans in rare cases if people touch infected birds, their droppings or bedding, or while preparing infected poultry for cooking. Under the prevention zone, people with more than 500 birds must now restrict access for non-essential visitors, change clothing and footwear before entering enclosures, and ensure vehicles are cleaned and disinfected regularly. Areas where birds are kept must be kept unattractive to wild birds, for example by netting ponds and removing food sources. Small backyard owners with only a small number of birds, including chicken, ducks and geese, have been told to limit risks and keep watch for signs of disease. In a joint statement, the chief veterinary officers for England, Scotland and Wales said all bird keepers had to take action. Following a number of detections of avian influenza in wild birds across Great Britain we have declared an avian influenza prevention zone across the whole of Great Britain, the statement said. Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to introduce higher biosecurity standards on your farm or small holding. It is in your interests to do so in order to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease. The UK health agencies have confirmed that the risk to public health is very low and UK food standards agencies advise that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 2}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 10}]}
{"id": "30", "fulltext": "Animals slaughtered and restrictions introduced in response to outbreaks of the virus in a number of countries Several outbreaks of severe bird flu in Europe and Asia have been reported in recent days to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), in a sign the virus is spreading quickly again. The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has put the poultry industry on alert after previous outbreaks led to the culling of tens of millions of birds. It is attracting the attention too of epidemiologists as the virus can be transmitted to humans. China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza so far this year, more than in the whole of 2020. South Korea reported an outbreak at a farm of around 770,000 poultry in Chungcheongbuk-do, the OIE said on Monday, citing a report from the South Korean authorities. All animals were slaughtered. Also in Asia, Japan reported its first outbreak of the 2021 winter season, at a poultry farm in the north-east of the country, the OIE said, confirming a statement last week by Japan's agriculture ministry. The serotype in this outbreak was H5N8. In Europe, Norway reported an H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the Rogaland region in a flock of 7,000 birds, the OIE said. Bird flu circulates naturally among wild birds, and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe in winter the disease can be spread to poultry and other captive birds. The Belgian government put the country on increased risk for bird flu, ordering poultry to be kept indoors as of Monday, after a highly pathogenic variant of bird flu was identified in a wild goose near Antwerp. This followed a similar move in neighbouring France earlier this month and in the Netherlands in October. Earlier this month, a bird flu prevention zone was declared across Great Britain, legally requiring all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures after a flock of poultry was culled near Dundee in Scotland in response to a bird flu outbreak.

{"id": "32", "fulltext": "George Eustice says restrictions in place since start of November require all birds to be kept indoors The UK has been hit by a record outbreak of avian flu that has led to 500,000 captive birds being culled in recent months. The environment secretary, George Eustice, told the House of Commons: 'This year we are now seeing the largest ever outbreak in the UK of avian influenza, with 36 confirmed cases.' He said an avian influenza prevention zone had been declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. He added: 'Our chief veterinary officer continues to lead the response to this episode.' Earlier the chief vet, Christine Middlemiss, said she was 'very concerned about what's happening.' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme after confirming more outbreaks overnight, she said: 'We now have a total of 40 infected premises in the UK. That's a really high number for the time of year for anything we've experienced before.' By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. Middlemiss said: 'All the birds on the premises have to be culled because of the ongoing risk of infection that they pose. The total number is something like half a million will now have been culled.' She said food supplies would not be hit. 'That sounds a huge number, and for those keepers affected it is really devastating, but it's a relatively very small number in terms of egg supply, meat, chicken and so on.' The disease is spread by migratory wild birds from Europe, where high infections levels are also being recorded. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive for avian flu, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland's Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected avian flu case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on Trotternish, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Middlemiss said almost 300 wild birds had been found with the disease at more than 80 locations. There was 'a lot of virus out there,' she said. The risk to human health is low but infected birds should not be touched. She said: 'It used to be that we would have a reasonable-sized outbreak and then have two or three quiet years. But that's not happening now. We're seeing this across the whole of Europe. We need to understand better why we're getting these ongoing infections every year.' Asked if the disease was still spreading, Middlemiss said: 'We're continuing to get the new detections. I confirmed another two last night and that's the rate we've been going at for the last week or so. We're seeing this as a huge pressure of infection from our wild birds.' Middlemiss urged people with garden bird feeders to 'practice routine hygiene precautions including proper handwashing.' She added: 'If you keep chickens and you want to feed wild birds, you need to make sure that everything is completely scrupulously clean and absolutely separate so that you don't take infection into your own birds and make them sick.' Asked if the climate crisis was to blame for the increased infection, Middlemiss said: 'We don't know specifically, but it's certainly one of the thoughts that our experts are having. The birds migrate to the north of Russia over the summer and mix with other birds on other global flight pathways and exchange the viruses. So it's quite plausible that with climate change and change in pathways that different mixing is going on.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 7}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "This year we are now seeing the largest ever outbreak in the UK of avian influenza, with 36 confirmed cases."}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "We now have a total of 40 infected premises in the UK.

{"id": "33", "fulltext": "With the UK hit by a record outbreak, here's a quick guide to the viral disease also known as avian influenza. What is avian flu? Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a contagious viral disease in animals, caused by a virus loosely related to human influenza. Some strains of the disease have been passed to humans but this is very rare, and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals. While all bird species and, less commonly, pigs are thought to be susceptible, domestic poultry flocks are especially vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks can rapidly result in epidemics among bird populations. Public health authorities are concerned about the potential of the virus to mutate into subtypes capable of causing human disease. As a result, they warn there is always a threat of a new influenza pandemic emerging. Why is it in the news again? The UK has been hit by a record outbreak that has resulted in 500,000 captive birds being culled this autumn. An avian influenza prevention zone was declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. What are the most dangerous strains? The NHS says there are four strains that have caused particular concern in recent years. The first, identified in 1997, was H5N1, followed by H7N9 in 2013, H5N6 the following year, and H5N8 in 2016. The H5N1 form has been the cause of most concern in recent years and the UK government has said particular safety measures were put in place in parts of North Yorkshire on 21 November after confirmed and suspected cases of that strain in poultry in the area. Where has it appeared? The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, has said there are 40 infected premises in the UK. They include 38 in Great Britain, of which 33 are in England, and two in Northern Ireland. By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland's Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on the Trotternish peninsula, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Some 22,100 ducks were culled at a commercial premises in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, while culling and an exclusion zone was also being applied to a second site in Broughshane, Co Antrim, described as a 'small backyard flock.' If it just affects birds, why the panic? It doesn't. World Health Organization (WHO) figures show that from 2003 to 2021 there were 863 confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus in humans. Of these cases, 456 people died. While transmission is rare, it has happened. So far, most of the human deaths have been in countries in Asia, in communities in which people live in close proximity to poultry. Although it does not easily infect humans, every time it does it increases the chance that the virus could mutate into a form that could be passed from one infected human to another. The WHO fears this could lead to a flu pandemic. How do you catch bird flu? It is very unlikely you will catch the virus unless you have been in close contact with infected birds or someone with confirmed or suspected bird flu. The virus is found in secretions from the eyes and respiratory tract, and droppings of infected birds. Humans can catch the virus by inhaling droplets sneezed by infected birds or the dust from their bedding or droppings. What are the symptoms in humans? They vary depending on the strain. Most infections have flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and aches and pains. Symptoms of the H5N1 subtype are more severe and frequently result in death. Other symptoms can include conjunctivitis, red, sore and discharging eyes. How does it spread? WHO scientists have said they believe it is likely the virus is carried by migrating birds. More recently the UK government has said it spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. Officials added: 'It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear. Avian influenza isn't an airborne virus.' It can spread to humans who touch infected birds, droppings or bedding or who kill or prepare infected poultry for cooking, the NHS has said. People cannot catch bird flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas affected by an outbreak, health officials have said. What measures is the UK taking? The government has said the chief veterinary officers for each of the UK's constituent nations have agreed to bring in new housing measures to protect poultry and captive birds from avian influenza following a number of confirmed cases across Great Britain in recent weeks. It added: 'The new housing measures, which will come into force on Monday 29 November, mean that it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.' How do you spot the virus in birds? Symptoms in infected birds include a swollen head and blue discoloration around the neck and throat. They will also show signs of breathing problems including gaping beaks, coughing, sneezing and rattling wheezing. Poultry farmers will also notice a loss of appetite in the infected birds and a decrease in egg laying. People are advised not to touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds they find. In Great Britain, dead wild waterfowl or other wild birds should be reported to Defra. Some will then be collected and tested to help scientists understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird. What drug treatments are available to humans? There is no vaccine for avian flu. If a person were infected, the NHS has said they would be either told to stay at home or put into isolation in hospital. They would then be treated with an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (known as Tamiflu) or zanamivir (known as Relenza). Scientists have found that such treatments help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival. They are also sometimes given to people who have been in close contact with infected birds, or those who have had contact with infected people, for example family or healthcare staff, the NHS said.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 16}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "Public health authorities are concerned about the potential of the virus to mutate into subtypes capable of causing human disease.

{"id": "34", "fulltext": "LONDON (AP) — U.K. authorities reported an unprecedented jump in early season cases of avian flu in both domestic and wild birds, triggering tight restrictions on poultry farmers across the country. The government has confirmed 40 outbreaks of avian flu among poultry and other captive birds this year, resulting in the culling of about 500,000 birds, Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said Thursday. There were 24 outbreaks during the entire 2020-21 bird flu season, which ran through the spring. “I’m very concerned about what’s happening,” Middlemiss told the BBC. “That’s a really high number for the time of year for anything we’ve experienced before, and that’s because of the high level of infection in the migratory wild birds. So it’s really, really concerning because those birds will stay with us over the winter until early spring and the risk of infection remains.” U.K. authorities keep a close eye on avian flu cases around the world because it is spread by migrating birds and can be devastating to poultry producers. Experts estimate that outbreaks during the 2014-15 and 2016-17 seasons cost U.K. poultry producers about 125 million pounds ($165 million). While the risk to humans is low, bird flu can affect people in rare cases. To control the spread of the disease, poultry producers must kill all birds at sites where infections are confirmed. In addition, they have been ordered to keep all birds inside or under nets to stop them from coming in contact with wild fowl, and to implement strict hygiene measures. While the number of birds culled so far this season sounds large, it is relatively small compared with the number of birds on U.K. poultry farms. Between the beginning of August and the end of October, poultry producers slaughtered about 20 million birds a week, according to the latest government statistics. “In terms of food supply impact, it’s actually a relatively small number,” Middlemiss said of flu-related culling. The situation in Britain is part of a larger trend across Europe, where authorities are seeing more frequent outbreaks of avian flu, Middlemiss said. Although researchers don’t know the reasons for the trend, one theory is that climate change has altered the migration patterns of wild birds, she said. “The birds migrate to the north of Russia over the summer and mix with other birds and other global flight pathways there and they exchange the viruses, so it’s quite plausible that with climate change and change in pathways different mixing is going on,” Middlemiss said. “But that hasn’t been fully investigated yet.”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "U.K. authorities reported an unprecedented jump in early season cases of avian flu in both domestic and wild birds, triggering tight restrictions on poultry farmers across the country."}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_3", "statement": "“I’m very concerned about what’s happening,” Middlemiss told the BBC. “That’s a really high number for the time of year for anything we’ve experienced before, and that’s because of the high level of infection in the migratory wild birds.

{"id": "35", "fulltext": "JERUSALEM (AP) — A bird flu outbreak in northern Israel has killed at least 5,200 migratory cranes and forced farmers to slaughter hundreds of thousands of chickens as authorities try to contain what they say is the deadliest wildlife disaster in the nation's history. Uri Naveh, a senior scientist at the Israel Parks and Nature Authority, said the situation is not yet under control. \"Many of the birds are dead in the middle of the water body so it's difficult for them to be taken out,\" he said Monday. Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg called the crisis \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country.\" \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" she tweeted. Yaron Michaeli, spokesman for the Hula Lake park, where the crane population is centered, said workers were removing the carcasses as quickly as possible, fearing they could infect other wildlife. Dafna Yurista, spokeswoman for the Agriculture Ministry, said half a million chickens in the area were being slaughtered to prevent the disease from spreading. About 500,000 cranes pass through Israel each year on the way to Africa and a small number stay behind, Michaeli said. This year, an estimated 30,000 cranes stayed in Israel for the winter. Michaeli said it is believed that the cranes were infected by smaller birds that had contact with farms suffering from outbreaks. Israeli media carried photos of workers in white hazmat suits collecting crane carcasses after the birds were first found to be sick about 10 days ago. Michaeli said the death toll among cranes appears to have stabilized in recent days. \"This is a good sign,\" he said. \"They might be starting to get over this. We hope very much.\" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said officials from the agriculture, environment and health ministries were monitoring the situation.

{"id": "37", "fulltext": "Israel is battling the coronavirus and a surge in flu cases. But it's an outbreak of the H5N1 avian flu among migratory cranes and domestic poultry that is drawing global concern. The bird flu, as it's also called, is spreading fast in northern Israel, where at least 5,200 cranes have died of the disease and hundreds of thousands of chickens have been culled in an effort to contain its advance. The avian flu is confined mostly to birds. It rarely jumps to humans, but when it does it can be lethal. As of October, the World Health Organization had confirmed 863 cases of H5N1 in people, 456 of whom died, around the world since 2003. Israel has not recorded any infections in humans this year. Those who have possibly been exposed to the virus are receiving preventive antiviral treatments. Other countries, including Britain, China, Norway and South Korea, have also reported major or higher-than-usual H5N1 outbreaks in recent months. In November, Britain declared a bird flu prevention zone, requiring all farmers to follow stricter biosecurity protocols after several outbreaks. Israel is a central stop along the route of many species of birds migrating from Europe and Asia to Africa, a convergence that raises the risk of avian flu spreading from wild birds to captive poultry populations in the country. Each year, about 500,000 cranes migrate through Israel, some 30,000 of which stayed to winter over there this year. The yearly stopover, often part of journeys lasting thousands of miles, draws the attention of bird enthusiasts, who travel to observe the large, long-legged and long-necked birds. The H5N1 outbreak has wrought \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country,\" Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg said in a tweet Sunday. She shared a photo of dead cranes peppering a lake in Israel's Hula Nature Reserve, a hot spot for migratory birds. \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" Zandberg said. Israel reported its first cases of bird flu in 2006, and has seen outbreaks nearly every year since, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The extent of this year's train of transmission is not yet clear, but regulations require poultry and wild birds be kept separated to limit the chance of transference. Word of Israel's latest outbreak began to spread on Dec. 19, when the Agriculture Ministry reported that H5N1 had been detected in a farming community, Margaliot, near Israel's northern border with Lebanon. The ministry said it had closed off the area and halted egg production. Crowded and unregulated chicken coops are a \"ticking bomb\" for developing diseases, Agriculture Minister Oded Feror said in a statement at the time. That same day, Israeli media reported that about 100 cranes had died in a bird flu outbreak in Hula Lake in a nature reserve in northern Israel. Authorities closed down the area to the public and days later temporarily shut the entire nature reserve. Israel's Nature and Parks Authority shared photos of workers in hazmat suits collecting the bodies of dead cranes from the water. In the following days, outbreaks were detected in at least three other farms in the north as the Agriculture Ministry underwent mass testing. The parks authority said Thursday that an estimated 1 in 5 cranes in Israel were likely to be infected with the virus, Israeli media reported. There have also been reports of deaths from the virus among other bird species. Israel's Agricultural Ministry has warned the public to buy only eggs with the required regulatory stamp and to consume thoroughly cooked eggs to prevent any further spread. The public has also been warned to keep a distance from wild birds. On Tuesday, the ministry told chicken farmers in Margaliot to monitor cats that spend time around the coops, as felines can also become infected with the virus. Israeli media outlets reported that the mass culling of chickens has created a shortage of between 15 million and 20 million eggs a month. About 200 million eggs are consumed monthly in Israel.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 11}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "The avian flu is confined mostly to birds.

{"id": "38", "fulltext": "Thousands of migratory cranes have died and more than half a million chickens have been culled as the country tries to contain a deadly bird virus. JERUSALEM — Israel is acting to contain a severe outbreak of avian flu that has already led to mass culling of infected poultry and has caused the deaths of about 5,000 migratory cranes in a popular nature reserve in the north of the country. The minister of environmental protection, Tamar Zandberg, described the outbreak, identified as the H5N1 type, as 'one of the worst blows to wildlife in Israel's history' after a visit to the Hula Nature Reserve this week. Hula is a wetland that is a central stop on the winter migration route to Africa. The reserve, usually bustling with bird watchers at this time of year, is temporarily closed to visitors and the Ministry of Environmental Protection said on Wednesday that Ms. Zandberg was working to suspend the rest of the hunting season in the country, which normally runs until the end of January. The fear, the ministry said, was that gunshots from bird hunters could cause the wild birds to fly off to other locations, spreading the disease, which it said could also be spread by contaminated car tires on hunters' vehicles or on the soles of their shoes, or by the dogs retrieving their prey. Officials have also warned of the danger of the transmission of avian flu from animals to humans, which could be deadly. No such cases have been recorded in Israel. The first signs of the outbreak came about two months ago, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, with infections cropping up in chicken and turkey farms in different areas of the country. Israel's minister of agriculture and rural development, Oded Forer, said about 600,000 chickens had been culled. He said that would mean a shortfall of 15 million eggs per month over the next few months and that the department was working to import millions of eggs. In an interview with Kan Radio, Israel's public broadcaster, on Tuesday, Mr. Forer blamed the outdated, overcrowded chicken coops that he said were common in Israel for the severity of the outbreak of the virus. The egg industry had been 'neglected for years,' he said, adding that most of the coops in Israel were like those from the 1950s or 60s, and that there was a need to move to more modern coops without cages. More than 100,000 cranes can gather in the Hula Valley during the migration season, which begins in October, according to the reserve, and in recent years many have sojourned there until the spring, when they move back north. The reserve said about 40,000 cranes were documented in the valley early this month. By mid-December the number of dead cranes began to mount up and avian flu was identified as the cause. Most of the dead birds have been found in the water. The avian flu outbreak comes as Israel braces for what its prime minister, Naftali Bennett, has called 'a storm of infection' from the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 6}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 0}]}

The first person in the UK to catch a new strain of bird flu has been named as 79-year-old Alan Gosling, a retired engineer who lived with about 20 ducks inside his home in Devon. Gosling, who had about another 100 ducks living outside on his property in Buckfastleigh, noticed several birds falling ill shortly before Christmas, Devon Live reports. Subsequent tests by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) were returned positive for the H5N1 strain of avian flu. They were subsequently killed shortly after Christmas. Gosling then tested positive for general flu virus and the H5N1 strain of avian flu, first for the strain in the UK. The risk to the wider public continues to be very low, health officials have said, but people have been urged to not touch sick or dead birds. Gosling reportedly welcomed about 20 of the birds into his home as pets after he began feeding the flock. His daughter-in-law, Ellesha Gosling, from Cranbrook, told Devon Live how Gosling begged for their lives to be spared and described the Muscovy ducks as his best friends.

Some strains of bird flu can pass from birds to people, but this is extremely rare, according to the UKHSA. It usually requires close contact with an infected bird, so the risk to humans is generally considered very low. Human-to-human transmission of bird flu is also very rare, the organisation said.

(AP) — A duck killed by a hunter in South Carolina had a contagious and dangerous bird flu that has not been detected in the wild in the U.S. in five years, officials said.

The Eurasian H5 avian influenza was first detected by Clemson University scientists and confirmed by federal testing, the school said in a news release. The U.S. Department of Agriculture alerted global health officials. Scattered Eurasian H5 infections have been detected in 2022 from Portugal to Bulgaria and in December, two cases were reported in eastern Canada, officials said. Anyone who has poultry, including backyard farms, needs to review their practices to keep birds safe from disease, said State Veterinarian Michael J. Neault, who runs Clemson University's Livestock Poultry Health program. Those practices include thoroughly washing hands before and after handling wild and domesticated birds and using gloves and other protective gear when handling live birds. Farmers should also keep their birds away from areas where geese and ducks roam, clean their cages and coops regularly and buy new birds from reputable sources and keep them away from the rest of the flock for 30 days, the university said. \"So far we have no indication that (the flu) has jumped from wild migratory birds to poultry and we'd very much like to keep it that way,\" Neault said in a statement.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 2}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 4}]}
{"id": "42", "fulltext": "Shoots cause stress for migratory species such as Svalbard barnacle goose, whose numbers are down 38%. The RSPB has called for an emergency shooting ban after an 'unprecedented' outbreak of bird flu that has left wildfowl populations in 'catastrophic decline.' Migratory geese that overwinter on the Solway Firth, which stretches between Scotland and Cumbria, are being hardest hit, with a 38% decline in the Svalbard barnacle goose breeding population from winter last year. While these are protected species and not subject to hunting, experts argue that pressure from wildfowlers on nearby, legal quarry species can have an impact. Shoots nearby can cause stress, scaring the birds into the air where they use up vital energy. Some estimates suggest the UK is facing the worst outbreak of avian influenza on record. Latest population counts of the Svalbard breeding population show a drop in numbers from 43,703 in November last year to 27,133 in this month's counts. Paul Walton, the head of habitats and species at RSPB Scotland, said: 'We are in the grip of an unprecedented outbreak and unfortunately the Solway seems to be the epicentre of this in the UK. Our birds are suffering and they need an urgent reprieve to help them get through this winter and ensure that as many as possible of those remaining survive to make their migration back home to Scandinavia to breed in the summer. The best way we can do this is by reducing the cumulative impacts of disturbance, including by wildfowling. Our teams on the ground are seeing many birds that are sick or dying and under significant stress. Anything that can be done to limit activities which incur additional disturbance at this time should be implemented with urgency. This action could help these populations during this period of catastrophic decline caused by the outbreak.' There are allowances under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 for a temporary pause in the hunting of wildfowl if there are prolonged periods of freezing weather. The RSPB is asking for this consideration in the event of a severe avian influenza outbreak. It has also asked the public to keep dogs under close control in the Solway coastal area to avoid further disturbing the birds. After the barnacle goose gained protection in the 1950s, following a long campaign by conservationists, the world population rose from just a few hundred individuals to about 40,000. But the recent sharp decline has made experts concerned the good work could be undone. Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry bird flu. Many bird populations, from chickens to swans, have been hit by the flu, which is deadly. An avian influenza prevention zone came into force across Great Britain on 3 November, meaning birdkeepers must keep their flock separate from wild birds and put strict biosecurity measures in place. Anyone who finds dead birds is advised not to handle them and to report the bodies to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_3", "statement": "Paul Walton, the head of habitats and species at RSPB Scotland, said: 'We are in the grip of an unprecedented outbreak and unfortunately the Solway seems to be the epicentre of this in the UK.'"}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_4", "statement": "This action could help these populations during this period of catastrophic decline caused by the outbreak."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 0}]}

The United States Department of Agriculture said its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza at the farm in Dubois County. State officials have quarantined the farm and its 29,000 turkeys are being euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease, said Denise Derrer Spears, a spokeswoman for the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. The USDA said turkeys from the affected farm will not enter the food supply and issued a reminder that poultry and eggs should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees (73.9 Celsius) to kill bacteria and viruses. The agency said avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S. The USDA said turkey infections are the first confirmation of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry in the U.S. since 2020.

This does not present an immediate concern to public health, federal officials said, but it does have agriculture and industry folks worried. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the confirmed case of the H5N1 strain of avian flu at a farm in Dubois County. It is a highly pathogenic strain, meaning it is lethal to all poultry that contract the disease. This is the nation's first confirmed case of the flu in a commercial operation since 2020 and six years since it was last found on farms in Indiana, when hundreds of thousands of birds were killed as a result.

'This is a foreign animal disease and shouldn't be on our landscape,' said Denise Derrer Spears, the spokeswoman of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. 'That flips the switch and makes this a big deal right off the bat, and we need to stamp it out before it gets out of control.' The response to the outbreak has been swift, both from state and federal agencies as well as the economy. Taiwan has restricted poultry meat and egg products from Indiana while China and Korea blocked non-heated poultry meat from the state, the USDA said on its website. Though limited, these trade restrictions and loss of poultry are a blow to the farm sector and individual producers. You cannot get bird flu from eating fully cooked poultry meat or eggs, according to medical experts. This does not present a food safety risk, and the USDA said turkeys from the affected farm will not enter the food supply. 'But it's a matter of public perception,' Derrer Spears said. The current situation began on Feb. 7, when the affected farmer noticed about 100 birds were dead in one of his barns and the remaining ones were lethargic. He worked with his veterinarian to get samples collected from the flock and sent to a lab at Purdue University. The results were then confirmed at a USDA lab in Iowa. The name of the affected farm has not been publicly identified. As soon as the state received the results, it issued a quarantine at the site and all those farms within a 10-kilometer radius. That includes 17 other operations, Derrer Spears said. She could not give exact numbers on how many birds were impacted, but it's likely more than a few hundred thousand. Dubois County is the top turkey-producing county in Indiana. And Indiana is the third-largest turkey-producing state in the country, the No. 1 state in duck production and the second largest in table eggs and egg-laying chickens. All those farms within the control area will have to test their animals at least once each week to monitor for the disease. The first round of tests came back negative, Derrer Spears said, but the state is remaining very cautious. 'While it's just one incident right now, 18 farms in total are affected by this,' she added. 'There is no cure for this disease, there is no way to save the birds, all birds will die from this so we want to put them down as quickly as possible.' The control area will remain in effect until the affected farm is fully cleaned, the euthanized turkeys are disposed of and no further cases are detected. All turkeys at the infected farm, 29,000 birds, were put down by Wednesday night, according to the state. That depopulation needs to happen as quickly as possible so that the birds do not languish and so the virus does not have more time to spread. The euthanized turkeys will then be disposed of onsite by composting them, a method that is approved and overseen by state and federal agencies. The barns and all equipment will also need to be thoroughly cleaned 'flat off the floor clean,' Derrer Spears said. Once the cleaning is complete and the disposal has reached a certain stage, the quarantine will be lifted. There are many factors involved and there is no target date to do that, the state said it likely will be about four to six weeks. It is unclear how the Dubois County flock was infected. The avian flu viruses are fairly common in wild migratory birds and waterfowl, according to Derrer Spears, and ducks and geese that contract the disease will spread it in their droppings as they fly by. The strain has been wreaking havoc on Asia and Europe and also has been found in some wild birds along the East Coast. Canada recently confirmed H5N1 bird flu in a commercial poultry operation in Nova Scotia. This outbreak is significant because it shows that the strain has entered a migratory pathway for birds called the Mississippi Flyway, which follows the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and includes several major poultry states such as Indiana. The last time this bird flu was found in commercial poultry in Indiana was in January 2016. 'Last time we had this, it was terrible,' Derrer Spears said. That situation similarly started with one flock and then testing showed that it had spread to nearly a dozen other flocks. Ultimately, more than 400,000 birds needed to be euthanized. The year prior, in 2015, the same strain wreaked havoc on the Midwest turkey industry and caused the largest animal disease outbreak ever in the U.S. While Indiana remained largely unscathed from that national outbreak, it led to the destruction of more than 50 million birds and cost the U.S. economy more than $3 billion.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "'This is a foreign animal disease and shouldn't be on our landscape,' said Denise Derrer Spears, the spokeswoman of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health.

Indiana on Wednesday reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu on a commercial turkey farm, leading China, South Korea and Mexico to ban poultry imports from the state, and putting the industry on edge at a time that labor shortages are fueling food inflation. The disease is already widespread in Europe and affecting Africa, Asia and Canada, but the outbreak in Indiana, which is on a migratory bird pathway, particularly rattled U.S. producers. A devastating U.S. bird flu outbreak in 2015 killed nearly 50 million birds, mostly turkeys and egg-laying chickens in the Midwest. The United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government. \"Everyone is just sitting on edge because we know what can happen and we don't want a repeat of that,\" said Denise Heard, vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association, an industry group.

The U.S. Agriculture Department called the disease low risk to humans. Reuters OPEC's low output strains oil market Global oil prices could climb further because of the OPEC Plus coalition's \"chronic\" struggle to revive production, unless the group's Middle Eastern heavyweights pump extra to compensate, the International Energy Agency warned. Crude has rallied to a seven-year high, to above $90 a barrel, as demand bounces back from the pandemic while supplies around the world lag. Plagued by underinvestment and disruptions, the 23-nation OPEC Plus alliance has been unable to fully restore the output it halted—a problem the IEA expects to worsen. With oil inventories at the lowest in seven years, the agency sees markets facing further strain. \"The oil market is incredibly tight,\" \"Prices continue to surge and are now reaching levels that are uncomfortable for consumers across the world,\" Toril Bosoni, head of the agency's markets and industry division, said in a Bloomberg television interview on Friday.

Federal and state authorities are surveilling and testing areas around the affected flocks, the USDA said. None of the affected birds will enter the food supply, according to the USDA. Recent avian-influenza outbreaks haven't posed a health risk to humans, federal officials have said. A severe outbreak in the U.S. could pose a threat to poultry companies such as Tyson, Perdue Farms Inc., Sanderson Farms Inc. and Pilgrim's Pride Corp. Meat companies are already raising prices as they cite worker shortages that have left them unable to meet customer demand, as well as higher transportation and feed costs. Tyson is working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus, a spokesman said, and the company doesn't expect the affected farm in Kentucky to affect its overall chicken production levels. Tyson Foods said last week on its quarterly earnings call with analysts that the Arkansas-based company has increased biosecurity protections in its East Coast facilities, taking extra time to clean vehicles that go to farms and reducing the number of trips to farms overall. 'We have very robust biosecurity measures in place across all of our facilities, and that includes testing every flock for avian influenza,' David Bray, group president of poultry for Tyson, said on the call. Multiple bird-flu cases have been reported across North America in recent weeks, prompting poultry companies to take action. Avian influenza has been confirmed in commercial and backyard flocks in three states this year, the USDA said. An outbreak was reported last week in Dubois County, Ind., on a commercial turkey farm. Earlier this month, bird flu was detected in two wild birds in Florida. In January, a separate case was found in a wild bird in Colleton County in South Carolina, according to the USDA. Canada also recently confirmed a bird-flu case in a commercial turkey farm in western Nova Scotia. The U.S. poultry industry has remained largely unaffected by the disease since an outbreak in 2015 led to the deaths of more than 50 million chickens and turkeys. Since then, chicken, turkey and egg processors invested in new biosecurity measures and other precautions to stem the disease's spread Perdue Farms said none of the recent outbreaks have affected its flocks, but the positive cases are concerning, a company spokeswoman said. The Maryland-based company is having all of its flock advisers visit the farmers in their service area to review biosecurity protocols, she said. Shares of Tyson closed down about 3% Monday. Shares of Sanderson Farms and egg giant Cal-Maine Foods Inc. both declined about 1%, while Pilgrim's Pride declined 0.5%. Major stock indexes declined by less than 1%. Any immediate impact on poultry companies' sales is likely to be minimal, because chicken-importing countries may decide to continue purchasing U.S. poultry products from states where bird flu hasn't been detected, said Christine McCracken, executive director of meat research at agricultural lender Rabobank. A bigger impact on exports could come if the virus is reported in major poultry producing states like Arkansas, she said. 'It is being carried by wild birds so there isn't much control over the spread other than traditional biosecurity measures,' Ms. McCracken said. 'It's still early in the season, but it wouldn't be surprising if additional cases are found.' Labor shortages on farms also may increase the risk of spreading the virus, she said. Chicken producers are relying on a smaller number of available workers to clean more farms, and newer workers may not be as efficient at certain hygiene practices, she said.

{"id": "50", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Farms that raise turkeys and chickens for meat and eggs are on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity, fearing a repeat of a widespread bird flu outbreak in 2015 that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion. The new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana. The 29,000 turkeys in the flock were killed to prevent the spread of the virus. Indiana officials said Tuesday a second flock of 26,473 turkeys near the first infected farm is suspected to have the same virus. Testing is underway to confirm. The second location already is within a quarantine zone established for the first farm. The USDA also has confirmed the presence of bird flu in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and are awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky. A backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also is positive for the virus. State officials quarantined areas and the birds at the new positively identified sites will be killed and removed. The poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they're urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry. Egg, turkey and chicken prices could rise and availability could drop if birds at enough farms were to be infected. It's definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry, said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. I feel positive that we can tackle this situation better and I have my fingers crossed that this will be an isolated case, however, I would hope for the best and be prepared for the worst. Health officials say no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S. and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern. The virus can spread from infected birds to people but such infections are rare and haven't led to sustained outbreaks among humans. The 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer, and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation's leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The disease caused egg and turkey prices across the country to soar for months, with the cost of eggs up 61% at one point and prices for boneless, skinless turkey breasts rising 75% between May and July 2015. The outbreaks were deemed the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history, costing the government nearly $1 billion for removal and disposal of infected birds and government indemnity payments to producers for the lost birds. The strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus. It has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified. Migratory wild birds often carry strains of avian influenza and they're often low pathogenic, which means they don't kill the birds. Sometimes those strains can get into domestic flocks and mutate into more deadly viruses. The H5N1 now spreading from wild birds is already highly pathogenic, which means it is deadly from the start, said Dr. Yuko Sato, a veterinarian and assistant professor in the Department of Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine at Iowa State University. U.S. surveillance efforts have identified the virus in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and South Carolina, making it apparent that it is in the environment broadly. The virus spreads easily from wild bird droppings and can be carried into commercial flocks on the feet of workers or on equipment, which is why high-level biosecurity protocol has been activated across the country in commercial operations. They've enacted new safeguards to prevent deadly bird flu infections, often referred to as HPAI, and isolate them when they occur. With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection, said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA, which deals with outbreaks on U.S. Federal and state officials are working with the poultry industry and have initiated steps such as an immediate quarantine that restricts movement of poultry and equipment used to move birds in and out of specified perimeters around an infected barn — usually around 6 miles (10 kilometers) initially — and eradication of the virus by killing and removing birds at the infection site. Testing occurs in the quarantine area of both wild and domestic birds. Disinfection is done to kill the virus at the affected farm and testing is used to confirm it's free of the virus. Producers who want to ensure eligibility for government indemnity payments in case of disaster must have a biosecurity protocol on hand that is updated regularly. To help with that, the USDA has developed a 14-point biosecurity plan for producers, which is audited yearly and reviewed every two years by state agriculture agencies, Sato said. In Iowa, a state with 49 million chickens, egg farmers are working with state and federal authorities to keep the disease out of their flocks, said Kevin Stiles, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council. IPA is maintaining open communications specifically related to biosecurity best practices and is offering surveillance testing. We are confident in our producers' preparedness and ability to manage their flocks, he said.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 9}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 8}]}
{"id": "51", "fulltext": "Poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia were confirmed to have birds infected with a highly lethal form of avian flu, federal agriculture officials said Monday, days after a flock of turkeys in Indiana tested positive, raising worries about a wider outbreak in the country. The most recently identified infections occurred at a Tyson Foods commercial broiler in Fulton County, Ky., that has 240,000 chickens, and in a backyard flock of mixed species in Fauquier County, Va. Kentucky officials said they were also waiting for the results of tests on a flock of turkeys in Webster County. The infections come after 29,000 turkeys were destroyed in Indiana once officials detected the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County. Federal officials said the Indiana outbreak was the first confirmed case in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020. The developments raise concerns that avian influenza could affect more poultry operations in the United States, which is the world's top producer of poultry and the No. 2 exporter in volume, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. They also come as the United States is seeing higher than usual inflation rates in necessities such as food. Avian influenza is carried by wild bird populations that spread the virus to domestic birds. Outbreaks involving more virulent strains result in higher mortality rates in domestic birds, potentially causing disruptions to the food supply. The outbreak in Fulton County was found after the operation reported an increase in poultry deaths to Kentucky officials. Avian influenza doesn't pose a public health risk to humans, U.S. agriculture officials said, so long as poultry and eggs are properly cooked at internal temperatures above 165 degrees. No human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the United States, although more than 700 global cases have been reported since 2003, federal officials say. Officials have quarantined the operations in Kentucky and Virginia, the Agriculture Department said, and birds at the locations will not enter the food system. Tyson Foods is heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, Gary Mickelson, a company spokesman, said in an emailed statement. The company tests all flocks for avian influenza before the birds leave the farms, he said. The recent outbreak will not affect Tyson's overall chicken production, because thousands of farms raise the birds for the firm, he added. In a deadly outbreak that occurred between December 2014 and June 2015, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys either died of HPAI or were killed to stop the disease's spread, according to the Agriculture Department. The federal government spent almost $880 million at the time to pay for the destruction of infected poultry, cleaning and indemnities for lost birds. The outbreak also led to a $1.1 billion decrease in exports of broiler chickens in 2015, compared with the prior year. Egg export income declined by $41 million, while income for turkey export fell by $177 million during the same period.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 2}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "The developments raise concerns that avian influenza could affect more poultry operations in the United States, which is the world's top producer of poultry and the No. 2 exporter in volume, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 7}]}
{"id": "52", "fulltext": "New confirmed cases of bird flu first noticed in Indiana are spreading among flocks of chickens and turkeys in three states, resulting in tens of thousands of birds testing positive for the virus. The new cases were reported last week when nearly 30,000 turkeys at a southern Indiana farm were euthanized after the H5N1 strain of avian flu was detected, the first time it had been seen in the U.S. since 2020. But on Monday and Tuesday, health officials said the same flu strain had been detected in 26,000 turkeys on another Indiana farm, as well as in a mixed flock of birds in Virginia and a flock of broiler chickens at a Tyson Foods farm in Kentucky. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the farms are quarantined and the birds in Virginia have been euthanized. The same will be done to those in Indiana and Kentucky, and another farm in western Kentucky is waiting on lab results. \"The risk is too high of spread to wait until the laboratory confirmation comes in, especially with the presumptive positive and clinical signs in the birds already,\" said Denise Derrer Spears, spokesperson for the Indiana board of animal health. \"So the owners are taking action to prevent further spread.\" There are an estimated 246,000 chickens at the Tysons farm, but it is unclear how many will be euthanized. Tyson Foods said in a statement to USA TODAY that they were working with Tennessee and Kentucky state officials, as well as federal officials, to prevent the spread. \"Tyson Foods is prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing. This includes heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, placing additional restrictions on outside visitors and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms. Tyson Foods' chicken products remain safe: the USDA confirms that avian influenza does not pose a food safety risk to consumers in poultry that is properly prepared and cooked. \"Because the affected farm in Kentucky is only one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for our company, the situation is not expected to impact our overall chicken production levels,\" the statement read. It is unclear how the latest bird flu cases began, but health officials have noted that migratory wild birds are likely spreading the disease. \"At this time, our goal is to continue to monitor the presence of (highly pathogenic avian influenza) in wild bird populations, and to quickly identify any instances where the virus spreads to commercial or backyard birds,\" the USDA said in a statement to USA TODAY. Kevin Stiles, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council, told The Associated Press steps were being taken to prevent the flu from entering the state. The state is the nation's leading egg producer and is home to 49 million chickens. \"IPA is maintaining open communications specifically related to biosecurity best practices and is offering surveillance testing. We are confident in our producers' preparedness and ability to manage their flocks,\" Stiles said. The National Chicken Council added the chicken industry remains on \"high alert,\" but plans are in place to control the spread of the virus.

{"id": "61", "fulltext": "A highly infectious strain of avian influenza has been found in waterfowl in Maryland and Virginia, wildlife advocates and environmental officials warn, but they say that it does not represent a threat to humans. Symptoms of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in birds include sneezing, coughing, walking or swimming in circles, and swelling of the legs and feet, the D.C. nonprofit City Wildlife said in a statement Tuesday. HPAI can also cause sudden death. Found in domestic and wild species, HPAI is highly contagious among birds. Although wild waterfowl are the most common carriers, they are often asymptomatic while birds of prey, such as hawks and owls, and scavengers, such as crows and gulls, may show more severe infection. Though not reported in the District yet, HPAI appears to be drawing closer. The U.S. Agriculture Department reported the disease Feb. 14 among a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Va. The disease is not an immediate public health concern, the USDA said in a statement, and no human cases have been detected. Cassie Shirk, director of legislation and government relations for the Maryland Agriculture Department, said USDA data showed multiple positive tests in wild birds in the Atlantic Flyway, including a duck in Kent County.

{"id": "62", "fulltext": "Though the risk to humans is low, scientists warn that outbreaks among farmed birds increase the potential for the virus to mutate and pose a threat to humans. A highly contagious and deadly form of avian influenza has been barreling across the eastern half of the United States in recent weeks, killing both wild birds and farmed poultry and raising fears that an unchecked outbreak could prove calamitous for an industry that was devastated by a similar virus seven years ago. Since early January, when it began killing chickens in northeast Canada, the virus has been identified in migratory waterfowl from Florida to Maine, and has infected backyard chickens in Virginia and New York and sickened thousands of turkeys in Kentucky and Indiana, prompting mass cullings and import bans. On Wednesday, federal officials announced that the virus, a so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza, had been found in a Delaware commercial chicken farm on the Delmarva Peninsula, home to one of the country's largest concentrations of poultry farms. Experts suspect wild birds returning from winter feeding grounds are spreading the virus, most likely through contaminated droppings. With the peak springtime migration still weeks away, many fear the worst is yet to come. 'It's very concerning given how quickly this thing is accelerating,' said Henry Niman, a biochemist in Pittsburgh who studies the genetic evolution of viruses and has been tracking the outbreak's spread across the country. 'I think we could see historic levels of infections.' Federal officials have been urging poultry growers to report sick or dying birds and to tighten their farms' biosecurity measures, which includes preventing contact between wild birds and domestic animals. 'It's important to note that avian influenza is not considered to be a risk to public health and it's not a food-safety risk,' Mike Stepien, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in an email. Although the danger to humans is low, scientists are keeping a close eye on the virus, the Eurasian H5N1, which is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry. That virus does not spread efficiently among humans, but it is extremely deadly, with a fatality rate of 60 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The strain currently spreading across the United States has not jumped to humans, but virologists and epidemiologists say the mounting infections among birds is worrisome because it increases the possibility that the virus could mutate in ways that make it more infectious to people. Dr. Gail Hansen, a public health veterinarian who is the former state epidemiologist for Kansas, noted that influenza viruses have historically been behind the pandemics that affect humans. Some medical historians have traced the deadly influenza pandemic of 1918 to Army recruits in Kansas who may have caught the pathogen from farm animals and then spread it to military camps in Europe. 'Scientists always assumed the next pandemic would be a respiratory influenza,' she said. 'We were wrong with Covid, but it's these kinds of viruses that keep us awake at night.' The virus has also been coursing through Asia, the Middle East and Europe. In recent weeks, 300 outbreaks have been reported in 29 European countries. In Israel, an outbreak at a nature reserve killed thousands of cranes. At the moment turkey farmers, especially those in Indiana and Kentucky, are most worried. Over the past two weeks, several farms in those states have been shuttered after officials discovered the virus among birds that spend their entire lives crammed into massive sheds. Farmers say they have been stunned by how efficiently the virus kills, with animals dying hours after the initial infection. In Indiana, state officials have moved quickly, euthanizing more than 100,000 birds and throwing a six-mile cordon around affected farms — a containment area within which exports are halted and birds are tested daily. 'Everyone is on super-high alert and trying to be as prepared as possible because we all remember the devastation of 2014 and 2015,' said Dr. Denise Heard, a veterinarian with the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. The 2014-15 outbreak is considered the most destructive in the nation's history. It sent poultry and egg prices soaring and cost the industry more than $3 billion — though the federal government compensated farmers for lost flocks. In the end, nearly 50 million birds were killed by the virus or destroyed to prevent its spread, a vast majority of them in Iowa and Minnesota. John Burkel, 54, a fourth-generation turkey grower in northern Minnesota, has been watching the spread with trepidation. In 2015, the virus tore through his farm in a matter of days, leaving just 70 survivors in a shed that had held 7,000 birds. The weeks that followed were spent culling, composting the dead and then repeatedly disinfecting the barns. As a precaution, health officials also advised that he and his son take a course of the antiviral drug Tamiflu. 'We've never seen a virus that virulent,' said Mr. Burkel, a state legislator who works the farm with his wife and two children. 'It was just horrible.' Since then, agriculture officials across the country have pushed farmers to embrace an array of biosecurity measures aimed at preventing outbreaks. They include sealing up tiny holes that might allow mice or sparrows to enter barns, disinfecting the tires of feed-delivery trucks before they enter a farm and creating 'clean' and 'dirty' zones where workers can change into fresh footwear and coveralls before stepping inside an animal containment shed. At the same time, experts say that federal officials have strengthened the nationwide system of surveillance that allows researchers to track, in almost real time, an avian flu's spread within wild bird populations. 'I think the crisis of 2015 made us realize it takes a village to prevent an outbreak and has left us much better prepared,' said Dr. Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian at Iowa State University who advises local farmers about improving their biosecurity practices. But hypervigilance has its limits, especially against a microscopic pathogen that can infiltrate a barn on the leg of a single housefly. For a growing number of scientists, the real threat is the nation's industrialized system of meat and dairy production, with its reliance on genetically identical creatures packed by the thousands inside huge confinement sheds. Nearly all the nine billion chickens raised and slaughtered in the United States each year can trace their lineage to a handful of breeds that have been manipulated to favor fast growth and plump breasts. The birds are also exceptionally vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. 'They all have the same immune system, or lack of an immune system, so once a virus gets inside a barn, it's going to spread like wildfire,' said Dr. Hansen, the public health veterinarian. Andrew deCoriolis, the executive director of Farm Forward, a sustainable agriculture advocacy group, said the lack of genetic diversity isn't just a threat to the nation's food supply; it is also a potential threat to public health. More than half the 22 strains of novel influenza virus that the C.D.C. has identified as 'of special concern' to human health are avian influenza viruses, he said, noting that a 2018 study examining the emergence of 39 highly pathogenic avian viruses found that all but two of them had emerged on industrial poultry farms. He said the sector's emphasis on biosecurity and infection containment obscures a larger, thornier issue that requires a fundamental rethinking of meat and egg production in the United States. 'Instead of asking how factory farms can prevent infections that originate in the environment, which is how they frame it now, we should be asking how they can prevent infections that originate on factory farms,' he said. 'If we keep raising more and more animals in these conditions, we should expect the exact outcome we're getting because that's how the system is set up.'

The virus has now infected backyard and commercial flocks in 12 states and it has been detected in migrating wild birds in about 20 states. Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said the industry and state and federal agencies have prepared for additional infections. Typically infected flocks must be killed and disposed of within 24 hours if possible. A 10-kilometer quarantine radius is usually established around an infected farm. Naig has said that if the virus spreads significantly into commercial egg, chicken or turkey populations, consumer prices and product availability could become an issue but it isn't yet. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the recent bird flu detections do not present an immediate public health concern.

{"id": "88", "fulltext": "Ready for more bad infectious diseases news? There's an outbreak of bird flu making its way into U.S. poultry flocks. If the virus continues to spread, it could affect poultry prices—already higher amid widespread inflation. The price of chicken breasts this week averaged $3.63 per pound at U.S. supermarkets—up from $3.01 a week earlier and $2.42 at this time last year, the Agriculture Department says. This week an outbreak was confirmed at a commercial flock in Nebraska, causing 570,000 broiler chickens to be destroyed. In Delaware and Maryland, more than two million birds at commercial poultry flocks have been affected. In South Dakota, an outbreak last week led to the killing of 85,000 birds. An outbreak confirmed March 14 at a commercial operation in Wisconsin meant more than 2.7 million egg-laying chickens were killed. The latest data from the USDA show 59 confirmed sites of avian flu across commercial and backyard flocks in 17 states since the start of the year. That figure includes chickens, turkey and other poultry. The USDA identified a case of avian flu in a wild bird in mid-January, the first detection of the virus in wild birds in the U.S. since 2016. Wild birds can spread the virus to commercial and backyard flocks. By Feb. 9, the virus had been identified in a commercial flock in Indiana. There have since been hundreds of confirmed cases of wild birds infected with avian flu. The last major avian flu outbreak in the U.S. was from December 2014 to June 2015, when more than 50 million chickens and turkeys either died from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or were destroyed to stop its spread. During that outbreak, chicken breast prices increased 17%, according to agriculture data company Gro Intelligence. But at the same time, prices for cuts of chicken geared toward the export market actually dropped due to bans on importing U.S. poultry in countries including China, South Korea, Cuba and Mexico. So the cost of leg quarters, for instance, dropped 18%, according to the data. Poultry prices—especially for eggs and turkey—were affected for years, the company reports. The impact on prices this time depends on how widespread the flu becomes. Whether the 2022 avian flu will affect the price of eggs and poultry depends on how widespread it becomes, says Ron Kean, a poultry science expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences. \"In 2015, we did see quite an increase in egg prices,\" Kean told Wisconsin Public Radio. \"The chicken meat wasn't severely affected at that time. We did see quite a loss in turkeys, so turkey prices went up. So, we'll see. If a lot of farms contract this, then we could see some real increases in price.\" What's the risk to humans from this bird flu? Not much so far, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the CDC's most recent update on March 7, the H5N1 bird flu poses a low risk to the public, and is currently \"primarily an animal health issue.\" The CDC notes that some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection. You can't get avian flu from eating poultry or eating eggs that are properly prepared and cooked, the USDA explains. The chance of infected poultry entering the food chain is extremely low, the agency says, because of its food inspection program and avian flu response plan. \"All poultry products for public consumption are inspected for signs of disease both before and after slaughter,\" the USDA notes, and avian flu causes a rapid onset of symptoms in poultry. For producers who suspect their flock may be affected by avian flu, the USDA has a guide to the warning signs, including a sudden increase in bird deaths, lack of energy and appetite, and a decrease in egg production. If a flock is found to be infected by bird flu, the USDA moves quickly—within 24 hours—to assist producers to destroy the flock and prevent the virus from spreading.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 0}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 10}, {"key": "deny_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "What's the risk to humans from this bird flu?

One of the new outbreaks will lead to the killing of 1.5 million chickens at an egg-laying farm in Guthrie County, about 60 miles west of Des Moines. The other was at a turkey farm in Hamilton County, about 65 miles north of Des Moines, where 28,000 birds will be killed. After they are killed, birds typically are buried in compost pits on the farms. Iowa State Veterinarian Dr. Jeff Kaisand said it appears the infections are coming from migrating wild birds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says 17 states have had outbreaks in commercial or private outdoor flocks this year. The virus has been found in wild birds in at least 25 states. With the addition of the new Iowa cases, the U.S. poultry industry has had to kill more than 15.6 million chickens and 1.3 million turkeys since Jan. 1. In Iowa alone, infections have been found in seven commercial flocks and two backyard flocks. Iowa's agriculture secretary, Mike Naig, said the situation could worsen since the spring migration is likely to continue for a few more months. Much depends on the weather and improved biosecurity on farms, he said. Naig said it's too soon to estimate the economic loss this year. 'It's a difficult time for poultry producers, not just those that have an infected site,' he said. Food prices are already high due to inflation and supply chain problems, and if the bird flu outbreak expands to enough farms, chicken, turkey and egg prices could climb higher. Health officials say they don't know of any people who have caught the bird flu in the U.S., and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern. The virus can spread from infected birds to people, but such infections are rare and haven't led to sustained outbreaks among humans. The worst recent bird flu outbreak in the U.S. happened in 2015, when more than 230 farms in 15 states had outbreaks leading to the killing of over 50 million birds. The total economic loss has been valued at $3.3 billion, according to research published in 2019 by a group of Iowa State University scientists. In 2015, cases didn't surface in Iowa until mid-April.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the presence of the bird flu strain in commercial and backyard flocks in several states. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is partnering closely with animal health officials in the affected states on joint incident responses, agency spokesperson Rick Coker told USA TODAY in a written statement. State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties were depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Found in Midwest, South: Bird flu detected at multiple chicken and turkey farms More positive tests: Bird flu detected in backyard flock on Long Island, New York Bird flu has been confirmed across several states this year, according to USDA. Massachusetts Wyoming North Carolina Ohio North Dakota Minnesota New Hampshire Nebraska Wisconsin Connecticut Iowa Missouri South Dakota Maryland Kansas Illinois Michigan Delaware Maine New York Virginia Indiana South Carolina According to the USDA, avian influenza, or 'bird flu,' is a respiratory disease of birds caused by influenza A viruses and can kill domestic poultry. It spreads rapidly through contact between the birds or contaminated material. The main reason for depopulating commercial poultry or turkeys is to try and contain the spread because it can spread quite easily, Tara Harrison, with North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine, told WRAL. The avian flu is devastating to farmers and to the birds they raise. HPAI does not discriminate between migratory birds, small backyard flocks or commercial poultry farms, and we urge all poultry owners to take precautions, Jim Chakeres, executive vice president, Ohio Poultry Association, said in a statement to USA TODAY. It is important to know that both USDA and CDC confirm that HPAI cannot be transmitted through meat or eggs and that it is not a public health concern. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent bird flu detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 1}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 10}]}
{"id": "97", "fulltext": "A rapidly escalating bird-flu outbreak in the U.S. is contributing to a surge in egg prices and threatens to raise prices on other poultry products in the coming months as deaths continue to mount. Cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza so far have led to the deaths of more than 17 million birds, according to Agriculture Department data. The virus outbreak, the worst in seven years, is hitting Midwest egg-laying flocks and affecting companies from Tyson Foods Inc. to Hormel Foods Corp. More than 11 million egg-laying chickens, roughly 3% of the total U.S. flock, have died or been destroyed as a result of the disease, along with more than two million commercially raised turkeys. Shell egg prices have climbed to $2.88 a dozen, up about 52% since Feb. 8, when the USDA confirmed the first case in a U.S. commercial turkey flock in Indiana. It is their highest point since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, according to market research firm Urner Barry. Prices are being driven higher by the disease's spread and the coming Easter holiday, when demand for eggs is high, analysts said. Industry officials aren't expecting any shortages, but analysts said retailers are buying up eggs in anticipation that supplies could tighten in the coming weeks. \"Egg availability heading into Easter is sure to be hampered,\" said Brian Earnest, an animal protein economist at CoBank. The U.S. supply of table egg-laying chickens is down from more than 340 million in April 2019 to about 322 million in February, he estimated. As a result, companies like Cal-Maine Inc., the largest U.S. egg producer by sales, are poised to see higher egg prices for the rest of the year as a result of the tighter market, said analysts at Stephens Inc. Cal-Maine said Wednesday that it hasn't had any cases at company-owned or contracted production facilities to date. \"We are also working closely with egg industry associations and government officials to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks and effectively manage our response,\" said Dolph Baker, Cal-Maine's chief executive. The price of turkey breasts, already at its highest levels since the last major avian influenza outbreak in 2015, has held around $4.45 a pound over the past few weeks, according to Urner Barry. With turkey supplies already tight and demand likely to grow in the summer months, further flock losses could push prices higher, said Russ Whitman, senior vice president at the firm. Dozens of bird-flu cases have been reported across the U.S. in the past two months, with cases ranging from Maryland to South Dakota. The disease was confirmed by the USDA in five new U.S. states Wednesday. The disease also was confirmed in several commercial turkey farms in Minnesota that supply Hormel's Jennie-O Turkey Store brand, affecting more than 300,000 turkeys, the company said. Perdue Farms Inc. said it received confirmation in late February of bird flu in two of its Indiana turkey flocks. Tyson said there was an outbreak in a flock of about 240,000 birds at a commercial farm in Fulton County, Ky., that housed the company's chickens. The bird-flu outbreak comes as food prices are already on the rise, with food makers paying more for fuel, ingredients and labor. Analysts said it can be difficult to pinpoint how much prices of certain protein products have been affected by the bird flu because of other inflationary pressures. The war between two grain-producing powers, Russia and Ukraine, is further inflating meat prices as producers rely heavily on grain to feed livestock and poultry. The U.S. poultry industry had remained largely unaffected by avian influenza since the 2015 outbreak that led to the deaths of more than 50 million chickens and turkeys, the largest ever recorded in the U.S. Since then, chicken, turkey and egg processors invested in new biosecurity measures and other precautions. Officials said the increased measures give them confidence they can mitigate the spread, but this year's outbreak has been hard to predict. The USDA has been working with the poultry industry and individual states on surveillance and communicating proper farm safety measures since then, said Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer at the USDA. The department said it compensates farm owners for fair market value of any animals euthanized and other costs associated with controlling the virus. Safety measures include not sharing equipment between farms and keeping it disinfected, and workers showering and donning clean clothing and boots before interacting with a flock, she said. Farmers also need to secure their barns from wild birds that could be carrying the virus: A breakthrough at a commercial farm could be as simple as a worker stepping on wild bird fecal matter outside of the barn and forgetting to clean their boots before entering, experts said. Trey Braswell, a fourth-generation farmer in Nashville, N.C., said he has limited visitors to his farm, disinfects all vehicles and requires any outside vehicles coming in to go through a carwash. His 1.7 million layer chickens haven't been affected so far. \"There is no foolproof system,\" he said. \"Egg farmers are working around the clock.\" Farmers, industry groups and the USDA have held weekly calls about managing the bird flu's impact, said Emily Metz, CEO of the American Egg Board, which represents egg producers. Shortages are still a long way off, she said. Egg producers have in some cases shifted orders around to avoid missed deliveries to customers, she said. \"If one producer is affected in a certain region, they are calling around neighbors to see if they can make sure the order is met,\" she said.

{"id": "98", "fulltext": "CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — A strain of avian flu has made its way to Wyoming, and poultry producers of all sizes are being warned to keep a close eye on their flocks. As of Thursday, the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, had been confirmed in two Wyoming counties. HPAI is a highly contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys and other birds, and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death in infected birds,” the Wyoming Livestock Board said in recent news releases. The virus was identified in birds from Johnson County, the state Livestock Board said Wednesday, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS. On Thursday, the Livestock Board said the virus had also been identified in Park County birds. Recent HPAI detections don’t present an immediate public health concern, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and no human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S., the news releases said. Both samples were from birds the news release said had been part of a non-commercial backyard mixed-species flock (non-poultry). They were initially tested by the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and were confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa. The Livestock Board said its officials had quarantined the areas where both flocks lived, and that the birds would be destroyed to prevent further spread. It also said it was working closely with USDA APHIS on a joint incident response, including additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The Livestock Board offered assurances that birds and eggs from the infected flocks would not enter the food system. Still, it issued a reminder that all poultry and eggs should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit as a general food safety precaution. More information can be found on the APHIS website. For more information specific to Wyoming, contact the Livestock Board at 307-777-7515, or visit its website at wlsb.state.wy.us/public. Following Thursday’s news release, the Livestock Board said, information about any additional confirmed cases would be shared directly with local communities and announced on its website. Prevention and monitoring Wyoming State Veterinarian Dr. Hallie Hasel told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle on Thursday that the avian flu hasn’t been seen in the state for several years. However, the U.S. has seen rapid spread in 2022, and it’s very difficult to predict when the virus might show up and how prevalent it may be, Hasel said. Anyone involved in poultry production, from the small backyard chicken owner to the large commercial producer, should review their biosecurity activities, or measures taken to prevent disease, the state Livestock Board said. Because avian flu is spread by migratory birds, the best way to prevent its spread is to keep poultry in a chicken coop or other structure away from wild birds, as well as from standing water, Hasel said. An ordinance allowing the keeping of backyard chickens within the city limits was passed by the Cheyenne City Council in April 2016. It is unclear how common the practice is currently. Hasel said that, because of the risk of spread between flocks, those who keep poultry should not visit other places where these birds are kept until the virus has stopped spreading. That will happen over the next couple months as we progress from spring into summer, Hasel said. The migration, of course, slows down, and so the spread of the virus will decrease significantly as the migratory birds have reached their destination. Birds should be monitored for symptoms of HPAI, including: coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite; decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; lack of coordination; and diarrhea. Even if birds aren’t showing symptoms, avian flu can cause sudden death, the Livestock Board said. Anyone who sees these symptoms should immediately contact their veterinarian. Those without a regular vet should call the Livestock Board at 307-777-8270 or 307-777-6440. Sick birds or unusual bird deaths can also be reported through APHIS at 866-536-7593.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 1}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 4}]}
{"id": "99", "fulltext": "A highly pathogenic form of the avian flu has been detected in 29 states. Millions of chickens and turkeys from infected commercial and backyard flocks have been killed. From Wyoming to Maine, an outbreak of the highly contagious bird flu has swept across farms and backyard flocks in the United States this year, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled. Iowa has been particularly hard hit, with disasters being declared in some counties and the state canceling live bird exhibits in an order that may affect its famed state fair. Here is what we know about the bird flu. What is avian influenza? Better known as the bird flu, avian influenza is a highly contagious and deadly virus that can prey on chickens, turkeys and wild birds, including ducks, geese and eagles. It spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it difficult to contain. Symptoms of the virus include a sudden increase in the mortality of a flock, a drop in egg production and diminished consumption of feed and water. The virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry. Its prevalence in the United States is not unexpected, with outbreaks previously reported in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Should humans be worried about being infected? The risk to humans is very low, said Ron Kean, a faculty associate and extension specialist in the University of Wisconsin at Madison department of animal and dairy sciences. 'It's not impossible for humans to get this virus, but it's been pretty rare,' Professor Kean said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had been monitoring people in the United States who were exposed to infected poultry and other birds. So far, no cases of H5N1 infection have been found among them, the C.D.C. said. Is it safe to eat poultry and eggs? Yes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has said that properly prepared and cooked poultry and eggs should not pose a risk to consumers. The chance of infected poultry entering the food chain is 'extremely low,' the agency has said. Under federal guidelines, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, part of the U.S.D.A., is responsible for inspecting all poultry sold in interstate and foreign commerce. Inspectors are required to be present at all times during the slaughtering process, according to the service, which noted that the inspectors have unfettered access to those facilities. Egg-production facilities that are subject to federal regulation are required to undergo daily inspections once per shift, according to the inspection service. State inspection programs, which inspect poultry products sold only within the state they were produced, are additionally monitored by the U.S.D.A. Because of the mandated culling of infected flocks, experts say, the virus is primarily an animal health issue at this time. Still, the U.S.D.A. recommends cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit to reduce the potential for food-borne illness. Can I expect to pay more for poultry products? Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015. Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'at record high levels,' according to an April 22 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A. If infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs. Prices for white and dark chicken meat were also rising, according to the U.S.D.A. Experts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile. How is the virus detected? Testing for the avian flu typically involves swabbing the mouths and tracheal area of chickens and turkeys. The samples are sent to diagnostic labs to be analyzed. Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states. As of April 20, the highly pathogenic form of the avian flu had been detected in 29 states, a tracking page maintained by the U.S.D.A. showed. The combined number of birds in the infected flocks — the commercial and backyard type — totaled more than 33 million, according to the agency. A spokesman for the U.S.D.A. confirmed that those birds would be required to be euthanized to prevent the spread of the virus. Two commercial egg production facilities in Iowa, one in Buena Vista County and another in Osceola County, constituted the largest infected flocks. Each was made up of more than 5 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said. A producer of eggs in Jefferson County, Wis., was the third-largest infected flock, with more than 2.7 million chickens. The outbreak has taken an unusual toll on raptors or birds of prey, including more than three dozen bald eagles. Because spring is nesting season, some experts are worried that avian flu may pose a serious threat to the birds' potential offspring. In April, two cases of bird flu were confirmed in zoos in the United States, the Agriculture Department told The Associated Press, though a spokesman declined to give details or identify the zoos. Officials said they would not order the widespread euthanasia of zoo birds as they have on farms. Zoos in the United States began moving birds indoors, away from people and wildlife, to protect them from the bird flu. How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones? The outbreak in 2014 and 2015 in the United States was blamed for $3 billion in losses to the agricultural sector and was considered to be the most destructive in the nation's history. Nearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota. The footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns. 'I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. What can be done to stop the spread of the virus? As early as last year, the U.S.D.A. warned of the likelihood of an outbreak of the avian flu and emphasized a hardening of 'biosecurity' measures to protect flocks of chickens and turkeys. Biosecurity measures include limiting access to the flocks and requiring farm workers to practice strict hygiene measures like wearing disposable boots and coveralls. Sharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus. So can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting. 'Whether that's limiting access where we source feed and water, even truck routes, how do we try to limit those connections that might spread pathogens between flocks are all really important,' Dr. Bowman said. 'At this point, every person producing poultry has to be considering how to improve their biosecurity.' Experts at the University of Minnesota have also recommended that people stop using outdoor bird feeders and bird baths for a few months, until the rate of transmission decreases, to discourage birds from gathering. 'Not only will this action help to protect those beautiful feathered creatures that visit your yard, but will also help all wild bird species that are already having it hard this spring because of the outbreak,' Dr. Victoria Hall, executive director of the Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota, said in a statement. Hummingbird feeders, which present a much lower risk, may be used but should be cleaned daily, the Raptor Center said. Is it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys? Infected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A. The virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks. Methods include spraying chickens and turkeys with a foam that causes asphyxiation. In other cases, carbon dioxide is used to kill the birds, whose carcasses are often composted or placed in a landfill. 'It's arguably more humane than letting them die from the virus,' Professor Kean said. Isabella Grullón Paz contributed reporting.

{"id": "102", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Bird flu has infected two more farms in Iowa, forcing the killing of 5.3 million hens and 88,000 turkeys, officials said Friday. The new cases mean that across the nation, farmers have had to kill about 22 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens but also including 1.8 million broiler chickens, 1.9 million pullet and other commercial chickens, and 1.9 million turkeys. Iowa accounts for many of those cases, with operations having to kill about 13 million chickens and 305,000 turkeys since the outbreaks began a month ago. Iowa is the nation’s leading egg producer and had 46 million chickens on farms in February, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Iowa raises about 11.7 million turkeys annually. The latest cases were at an egg farm in Osceola County and a turkey farm in Cherokee County, both in northwest Iowa. Earlier this week, state officials also confirmed the virus on a turkey farm with 35,500 birds in Buena Vista County. Because the virus is so infectious and deadly for commercial poultry, entire flocks are destroyed and composted on the farms when they are infected. USDA data shows 23 states have confirmed cases in commercial or backyard flocks. Spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings or nasal discharge of infected wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which can contaminate dust and soil.

But the average weekly price for large eggs is 44% higher than this time last year, according to USDA data. Eggs prices were up 11.4% in February from a year earlier and were up 2.2% from January, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data published in March. The wholesale cost for a carton of eggs in the Midwest jumped 60% from March 25 to April 1 to $2.47. That's still below the peak price in late March 2020, when pandemic and Easter demand collided and caused wholesale egg prices to more than triple to an all-time high of $3.07 a dozen. By far the hardest-hit state has been Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer and home to 46 million chickens on farms as of February, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

Quarters, nickels, dimes and pennies are in short supply again Is it safe to eat eggs amid avian flu? According to USDA outbreak tracking, more than 13 million hens have been killed in Iowa in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. Nationwide, the outbreak has affected nearly 18 million commercial table egg layer hens and nearly 2 million turkeys. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the risk to the general public's health is low. \"So far, current H5N1 bird flu viruses lack changes seen in the past that have been associated with viruses spreading easily among poultry, infecting people more easily, and causing severe illness in people,\" the CDC said in a March update about the outbreak. Only one human case of the H5N1 virus has been reported. It was found in January in a person in the United Kingdom who did not have any symptoms and who raised birds that became infected. No human infections have been identified in the U.S. The CDC and USDA said poultry and eggs that are properly prepared and cooked are safe to eat. \"The proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165F kills bacteria and viruses, including H5N1 bird flu viruses,\" according to the CDC.

{"id": "105", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Zoos across North America are moving their birds indoors and away from people and wildlife as they try to protect them from the highly contagious and potentially deadly avian influenza. Penguins may be the only birds visitors to many zoos can see right now, because they already are kept inside and usually protected behind glass in their exhibits, making it harder for the bird flu to reach them. Nearly 23 million chickens and turkeys have already been killed across the United States to limit the spread of the virus, and zoos are working hard to prevent any of their birds from meeting the same fate. It would be especially upsetting for zoos to have to kill any of the endangered or threatened species in their care. 'It would be extremely devastating,' said Maria Franke, who is the manager of welfare science at Toronto Zoo, which has less than two dozen Loggerhead Shrike songbirds that it's breeding with the hope of reintroducing them into the wild. 'We take amazing care and the welfare and well being of our animals is of the utmost importance. There's a lot of staff that has close connections with the animals that they care for here at the zoo.' Toronto Zoo workers are adding roofs to some outdoor bird exhibits and double-checking the mesh surrounding enclosures to ensure it will keep wild birds out. Birds shed the virus through their droppings and nasal discharge. Experts say it can be spread through contaminated equipment, clothing, boots and vehicles carrying supplies. Research has shown that small birds that squeeze into zoo exhibits or buildings can also spread the flu, and that mice can even track it inside. So far, no outbreaks have been reported at zoos, but there have been wild birds found dead that had the flu. For example, a wild duck that died in a behind-the-scenes area of the Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines, Iowa, after tornadoes last month tested positive, zoo spokesman Ryan Bickel said. Most of the steps zoos are taking are designed to prevent contact between wild birds and zoo animals. In some places, officials are requiring employees to change into clean boots and don protective gear before entering bird areas. When bird flu cases are found in poultry, officials order the entire flock to be killed because the virus is so contagious. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has indicated that zoos might be able to avoid that by isolating infected birds and possibly euthanizing a small number of them. Sarah Woodhouse, director of animal health at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, said she is optimistic after talking with state and federal regulators. 'They all agree that ordering us to depopulate a large part of our collection would be the absolute last-ditch effort. So they're really interested in working with us to see what we can do to make sure that we're not going to spread the disease while also being able to take care of our birds and not have to euthanize,' Woodhouse said. Among the precautions zoos are taking is to keep birds in smaller groups so that if a case is found, only a few would be affected. The USDA and state veterinarians would make the final decision about which birds had to be killed. 'Euthanasia is really the only way to keep it from spreading,' said Luis Padilla, who is vice president of animal collections at the Saint Louis Zoo. 'That's why we have so many of these very proactive measures in place.' The National Aviary in Pittsburgh — the nation's largest — is providing individual health checks for each of its roughly 500 birds. Many already live in large glass enclosures or outdoor habitats where they don't have direct exposure to wildlife, said Dr. Pilar Fish, the aviary's senior director of veterinary medicine and zoological advancement. Kansas City Zoo CEO Sean Putney said he's heard a few complaints from visitors, but most people seem OK with not getting to see some birds. 'I think our guests understand that we have what's in the best interests of the animals in mind when we make these decisions even though they can't get to see them,' Putney said. Officials emphasize that bird flu doesn't jeopardize the safety of meat or eggs or represent a significant risk to human health. No infected birds are allowed into the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs kills bacteria and viruses. No human cases have been found in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ___ Associated Press Writers David Pitt contributed to this report from Des Moines, Iowa, Lindsay Whitehurst contributed from Salt Lake City, Julie Watson contributed from San Diego, Chris Grygiel contributed from Seattle and Tom Tait contributed from Las Vegas.

{"id": "108", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The spread of a bird flu that is deadly to poultry raises the grisly question of how farms manage to quickly kill and dispose of millions of chickens and turkeys. It's a chore that farms across the country are increasingly facing as the number of poultry killed in the past two months has climbed to more than 24 million, with outbreaks reported nearly every day. Some farms have had to kill more than 5 million chickens at a single site with a goal of destroying the birds within 24 hours to limit the spread of the disease and prevent animals from suffering. 'The faster we can get on site and depopulate the birds that remain on site, the better,' Minnesota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said. The outbreak is the biggest since 2015, when producers had to kill more than 50 million birds. So far this year, there have been cases in 24 states, with Iowa the hardest hit with about 13 million chickens and turkeys killed. Other states with sizable outbreaks include Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota and Indiana. Farms faced with the need to kill so many birds turn to recommendations by the American Veterinary Medical Association. Even as it has developed methods to kill the poultry quickly, the association acknowledges its techniques 'may not guarantee that the deaths the animals face are painless and distress free.' Veterinarians and U.S. Department of Agriculture officials also typically oversee the process. One of the preferred methods is to spray water-based firefighting foam over birds as they roam around the ground inside a barn. That foam kills the animals by cutting off their air supply. When foam won't work because birds are in cages above the ground or it's too cold, the USDA recommends sealing up barns and piping carbon dioxide inside, first rendering the birds unconscious and ultimately killing them. If one those methods won't work because equipment or workers aren't available, or when the size of a flock is too large, the association said a last resort is a technique called ventilation shutdown. In that scenario, farmers stop airflow into barns, which raises temperatures to levels at which the animals die. The USDA and the veterinary association recommend that farmers add additional heat or carbon dioxide to barns to speed up the process and limit suffering by the animals. Mike Stepien, a spokesman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said the techniques are the best options when it's necessary to quickly kill so many birds. 'State animal health officials and producers carefully weigh the different options to determine the best option for humane depopulation and do not make such decisions lightly,' Stepien said. Not everyone agrees. Animal welfare groups argue that all these methods for quickly killing birds are inhumane, though they are particularly opposed to ventilation shutdown, which they note can take hours and is akin to leaving a dog in a hot car. Animal rights groups delivered a petition last year signed by 3,577 people involved in caring for animals, including nearly 1,600 veterinarians, that urged the veterinary association to stop recommending ventilation shutdown as an option. 'We have to do better. None of these are acceptable in any way,' said Sara Shields, director of farm animal welfare science at Humane Society International. Opponents of the standard techniques said firefighting foam uses harmful chemicals and it essentially drowns birds, causing chickens and turkeys to suffer convulsions and cardiac arrest as they die. They say carbon dioxide is painful to inhale and detectible by the birds, prompting them to try to flee the gas. Karen Davis, of the nonprofit group United Poultry Concerns, urged the veterinary association to stop recommending all of its three main options. 'They're all ways that I would not choose to die, and I would not choose anybody else to die regardless of what species they belong to,' Davis said. Shields said there are more humane alternatives, such as using nitrogen gas but those options tend to be more expensive and could have logistical challenges. Sam Krouse, vice president of Indiana-based MPS Egg Farms, said farmers feel miserable about using any of the options. 'We pour our lives and livelihoods into taking care of those birds, and it's just devastating when we lose any of those birds,' Krouse said. 'Everything that we're doing every day is focused on keeping the disease out and making sure that we're keeping our hens as safe as possible.' Officials emphasize that this virus that's spread primarily through the droppings of infected wild birds doesn't threaten food safety or represent a significant public health threat. Sick birds aren't allowed into the food supply and properly cooking poultry and eggs kills any viruses that might be present. And health officials say no human cases of bird flu have been found in the United States during this current outbreak. Once poultry are dead, farmers must quickly dispose of the birds. They usually don't want to risk the chance of spreading the virus by transporting the carcasses to landfills, so crews typically pile the birds up into huge rows inside barns and combine them with other materials, such as ground up corn stalks and sawdust to create a compost pile. After a couple weeks of decomposition, the carcasses are converted into a material that can be spread on cropland to help fertilize crops. In some cases, carcasses are buried in trenches on the farm or incinerated. Eds: UPDATES: Updates the total number of birds killed in the last two months to reflect the latest confirmed cases.

{"id": "110", "fulltext": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The Minnesota Legislature rushed through $1 million in emergency funding Thursday to bolster the fight against bird flu, a highly contagious disease that has cost the state's turkey farmers more than 1 million birds. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Torrey Westrom, of Elbow Lake, pointed out before the unanimous vote in the Senate and the 129-1 vote in the House that the number of Minnesota farms and birds affected by the highly pathogenic form of bird flu has doubled in less than a week. Minnesota is the top turkey producing state, with nearly 700 farms that raise about 40 million birds per year. According to an update on Thursday from the Board of Animal Health, the virus had infected 19 commercial turkey farms and two backyard flocks in 11 Minnesota counties with a combined 1,017,568 birds. Across the U.S., the outbreak is the biggest since 2015, when producers had to kill more than 50 million birds to keep the virus from spreading. Cases have been reported in 24 states this year, with Iowa the hardest hit. The number of chickens and turkeys killed in the past two months has climbed to more than 24 million. Zoos across North America are moving their birds indoors and away from people and wildlife to protect them. Rep. John Burkel, a former turkey farmer from Badger, recounted how his farm in Roseau County was struck in 2015. That outbreak required euthanizing 9 million birds statewide. \"The virus is different this time, and the need and the urgency is greater,\" Burkel said. Rep. Dave Baker, of Willmar, who represents one of the hardest hit areas of Minnesota, said the cold weather and worker shortages are making it harder this time for producers to euthanize infected flocks because the foaming machines used to suffocate the birds don't work as well. The bill, which Gov. Tim Walz is expected to sign soon, is meant to buy time by putting an extra $1 million into an emergency account at the Minnesota Department of Agriculture to supplement the $400,000 currently there. It will help pay for testing materials, equipment and personnel. Lawmakers are expected to field requests for more money later. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says bird flu poses little risk to the general public and that poultry remains safe to eat as long as it's properly cooked. ___ This story was first published April 7, 2022.

{"id": "111", "fulltext": "A deadly and highly infectious avian flu is forcing US farmers to kill millions of egg-laying hens, reducing the country's egg supply and driving up prices. On Thursday, retailers paid between $2.80 and $2.89 for a dozen large grade A white eggs in the Midwest, according to the USDA's daily Midwest regional egg report. That's more than double the roughly $1.25 they cost in March, according to data compiled by Brian Earnest, lead protein industry analyst at Cobank, which provides financial services to agribusiness. Typically, large white eggs in that region cost somewhere between $0.70 and $1.10 per dozen, said Earnest, who noted that the Midwest prices serve as a national benchmark. Around Easter, when demand is high, those prices can reach about $2, he said—far lower than they were on Thursday. Higher feed costs and supply chain difficulties have made many food items more expensive this year, and eggs are no exception. But this particular spike is being driven by the highly pathogenic avian influenza that has been detected in flocks across the country, Earnest noted. It's the worst US outbreak of the bird flu since 2015. Though the flu is deadly for poultry, it is \"primarily an animal health issue,\" according to the Centers for Disease Control, which added that it believes \"the risk to the general public's health from current H5N1 bird flu viruses is low.\" Because the flu is so contagious and deadly to birds, the USDA protocol is to kill infected flocks to curb the spread of the disease. In Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer, \"we currently have more than a dozen sites impacted by the disease,\" including three facilities where hens lay eggs, said Chloe Carson, communications director of the Iowa Department of Agriculture. As a result \"we have had to depopulate 11.2 million laying hens,\" out of about 56 million laying hens in Iowa overall, she said. This particular strain of the flu is being spread by wild migratory birds, Carson explained. The migration season typically lasts from March to May, she noted. \"As long as the migration patterns continue, there is a risk for disease to continue to be introduced to our domestic populations,\" Carson said. Pricier eggs this summer Although wholesale egg prices are spiking, that doesn't mean supermarkets are passing those costs onto consumers, explained Earnest. Retailers will often \"take a loss on eggs to draw in store traffic,\" he said. Generally, around Easter or Christmas, when people are more likely to bake, \"we'll see a reduced price on-shelf for eggs.\" So rather than raising prices, some stores appear to be dealing with the higher costs by eliminating their egg promotions. \"Retail promotional activity was very limited and offered little incentive for shoppers to buy beyond immediate needs,\" according to the USDA's weekly egg markets overview, published last Friday. Eventually, however, prices are likely to go up. \"I would expect we're going to see at least a 30 or 40 percent premium on top of [typical prices] through the summer months this year as a result of the tighter supply,\" Earnest said. He also noted that even before the flu was detected in the US earlier this year, the number of egg-laying hens was relatively low. And frozen or dry egg inventories are \"down significantly from what they typically are,\" he said. That could mean there will be some egg shortages later this year.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 1}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 4}, {"key": "deny_pandemic_statement_1", "statement": "Though the flu is deadly for poultry, it is 'primarily an animal health issue,' according to the Centers for Disease Control, which added that it believes 'the risk to the general public's health from current H5N1 bird flu viruses is low.'"}]}
{"id": "112", "fulltext": "US officials believe nearly 24m poultry birds, mostly chickens and turkeys, have died of flu since virus strain identified in February. Millions of birds have died in the US in recent weeks, because of a contagious strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, popularly known as bird flu. The bird flu has also led zoos across the US to temporarily close aviary exhibits and move birds away from the public. At zoos from Colorado to Maryland, species ranging from ostriches to penguins have been moved indoors. The virus poses a low risk to humans, but the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has estimated that nearly 24m poultry birds, mostly chickens and turkeys, have died of the flu since February, when a flock of turkeys in Indiana were confirmed to have the virus. The bird flu has been seen in at least 24 states. Last seen in the US in 2015, bird flu arrives through wild migratory birds, the season for which lasts from March to May. Wild birds, including waterfowl like ducks and geese, tend to not get sick when infected. Farmed chickens and turkeys are highly susceptible. As a result, poultry meat and eggs are in tighter supply. In Iowa, the state that produces the most eggs, more than 11m of 56m egg-laying hens have died. 'As long as the [wild bird] migration patterns continue, there is a risk for disease to continue to be introduced to our domestic population,' Chloe Carson, the communications director of the Iowa agriculture department, told CNN. Egg prices have risen. The average price of a dozen eggs has reached $2.60, compared to around $1.40 at the same time last year, according to the USDA. The agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, told reporters on Tuesday that because poultry facilities developed stricter containment measures after the last bird flu outbreak in 2015, they are better equipped to prevent the virus spreading. 'The nature of the outbreaks, the size of the operations that have been impacted, the number of states that are dealing with backyard operations as opposed to commercial-sized operations, would strongly suggest that when this is all said and done, it's going to be significantly less than what we experienced in 2014-15,' Vilsack said. ZOO UPDATE: Cases of avian flu have been confirmed across the US, including Maryland. This strain of the disease is highly contagious and lethal to birds. As a precautionary measure, most avian species will be off exhibit until the threat has subsided. Zoos have also taken precautionary measures. In a statement, the Maryland zoo said: 'We have moved birds that are more likely to come in contact with migrating waterfowl. These birds have been moved to indoor housing. Because the disease can be tracked on shoes, zoo aviaries have been closed and indoor contact with birds is limited to a small number of staff.' While previous bird flu viruses have affected humans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has noted that this current virus has so far posed a low risk to the general public's health. 'Some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection,' the CDC said. 'The CDC is watching this situation closely and taking routine preparedness and prevention measures in case this virus changes to pose a greater human health risk.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 7}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 9}]}
{"id": "113", "fulltext": "Zoos across the country are moving their birds indoors to protect them from the spread of a contagious and potentially lethal strain of the avian flu. Cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) have been rising in backyard flocks and wild birds across dozens of states in recent months, prompting zoo officials to temporarily shut down bird exhibits. \"This strain of the disease is highly contagious and lethal to birds,\" the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore said in a statement on its website. \"As a precautionary measure, we have closed our aviaries and moved several of our bird species to behind-the-scenes facilities with limited human contact until the threat of avian influenza has subsided.\" Birds in zoos could get infected by wild birds, humans or a new bird introduced to the facility. The avian flu was first detected in February in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, according to the US Department of Agriculture. This was the first case of infection in the US since 2020. The disease caused by the flu has been detected in commercial and backyard flocks across 24 states and in wild birds across 31 states, according to the department. The Type A viruses naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry along with bird and animal species, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They don't usually affect humans, it said. The spread has led zoos in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas and Ohio in addition to Maryland to take preventative steps, including closing outdoor bird exhibits and moving the birds indoors for their safety. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) established the Zoo and Aquarium All Hazards Partnership program, which collaborates with zoos to create a plan before outbreaks occur. Preventative measures include putting up tarps or netting around the exhibits, closing walk-through aviaries to the public and implementing strong quarantine protocols, according to Rob Vernon, AZA's senior vice president for communications and strategy. \"Facilities are going to be in full response mode to protect their birds for at least the next couple of months until transmission decreases,\" Vernon told CNN in a statement. Zoos take precautionary measures In an effort to prevent infections, zoos have taken various steps to keep their birds safe. The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium has barred the public from accessing birds including ostriches, chickens and owls. Visitors may see flamingos and penguins through the glass of their indoor habitats. In Colorado, the Denver Zoo moved its birds indoors for at least 28 days, it said in a statement. Dr. Ann Duncan, who heads animal health at Detroit Zoological Society, said moving birds indoors is a crucial preventive measure. \"By bringing these animals indoors, we can more closely monitor them and prevent contact with wild birds who may be carriers of HPAI,\" Duncan said in a February news release from the Detroit Zoo. The Maryland Zoo is adhering to a multi-tiered response plan reviewed by the USDA as well as other state departments, it said in a statement. The zoo, which has the largest colony of African penguins in North America, has not detected cases -- but the case count is close enough to move its birds indoors, according to its senior communications director, Mike Evitts. \"We are hatching penguin chicks as part of a plan to increase their numbers with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums breeding program as part of a global conservation effort,\" he said. Prompted by an abundance of caution, the Milwaukee County Zoo's Aviary and Humboldt Penguin exhibit has temporarily closed, according to its website. The Dallas Zoo also moved its birds away from public-facing enclosures \"until the threat has passed,\" saying animal health experts will continue to monitor and follow protocols as needed, the zoo said in a statement. Ohio's Columbus Zoo also shuttered some bird habitats as they undergo monitoring and evaluation, according to its director of communication, Jen Fields.

Egg prices typically see a spike in late March to early April depending on when Easter falls as demand increases. Often, the holiday is when retailers discount eggs. The latest USDA data shows signs of prices dropping in the last week. Consumer demand for shell eggs declined as shoppers are finding little incentive at the local grocer to buy beyond normal needs, the USDA said in its Egg Markets Overview report from April 8. Plastic eggs have been encroaching on shell egg demand during Easter for years but shell eggs have managed to hold their own for holiday baking needs. According to Numerator's Easter 2022 Consumer Sentiment Study, 75% of consumers expect inflation to impact their shopping. The National Retail Federation found inflation concerns were driving consumers to seek the most value for their dollar when shopping for the Easter holiday. How to crack the high price of eggs USA TODAY asked readers how they planned on saving on egg purchases. Here are some of their strategies along with expert advice. Buy eggs in bulk at Costco, Sam's Club Many said they'd shop at wholesale clubs like Costco and buy eggs in bulk. Some said they'd shop more at bigger chains like Walmart or Target. Kristin McGrath, a shopping expert and editor at deal website RetailMeNot, also suggests shopping wholesale to save. For saving on real eggs to paint and decorate for Easter Sunday, scan local grocery stores' weekly coupon offerings for savings on eggs, or head to a warehouse store like Sam's Club for bulk discounts on large quantities of eggs, McGrath told USA TODAY. USA TODAY visited stores in Coral Springs, Florida and found Costco had the lowest egg price with five dozen eggs for $8.39 and two dozen for $3.69. The second-lowest was Aldi at $1.90 a dozen.

U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman Mike Stepien declined to release any details about the zoo cases Thursday, including which two zoos were involved. Many zoos across the country have closed down their aviaries and moved birds inside whenever possible to help protect them from avian influenza that officials believe is primarily being spread by the droppings of wild birds. At many zoos, penguins might be the only birds visitors can see because they are generally kept inside behind glass where they are shielded from the virus. Nearly 27 million chickens and turkeys have been slaughtered in 26 states to limit the spread of bird flu during this year's outbreak. Officials order entire flocks to be killed when the virus is found on farms. Stepien said zoos work with state veterinary officials when the virus is found, but unlike farms, zoos are generally allowed to isolate and treat an infected bird as long as they take precautions to protect the other birds in their collections. Health officials emphasize that bird flu doesn't jeopardize food safety because infected birds aren't allowed into the food supply and properly cooking meat and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses. The disease also doesn't represent any immediate public health threat, and no human cases have been found in America. This year's outbreak is the worst one since 2015 when roughly 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered because of the virus. Stepien said that there were very few bird flu cases in captive wild birds in 2015 and none in large zoos, and no wild birds at zoos were euthanized that year.

The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus is very contagious among birds and can be lethal in domestic poultry, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, it poses a low risk to the human population. Zoos across the country have been moving their birds indoors over the past couple of months to protect them from the spread of the potentially deadly strain. The Baker's Lake preserve is home to one of the most significant heron rookeries in the Midwest, according to the Forest Preserves organization. In addition, many other native and migratory birds nest and feed there. Because of the nature of the local bird population, the avian influenza impact to date has only been observed among waterfowl and water birds, the organization added.

The deaths of the bald eagles in Georgia are the latest reported across the nation. Last month, two bald eagles in Vermont were found to be infected with avian influenza, state wildlife officials announced. North Carolina also reported the death of a bald eagle in that state in March. Nationwide, federal officials have confirmed more than 660 cases of the avian flu in wild birds this year, including 11 cases in Georgia.

The premise where the bird flu was found is under quarantine and the birds have been destroyed to prevent further spread of the virus, the department said. The flock contained about 20 birds of multiple species, it said. The finding underscores the ongoing high risk for the disease in Michigan, the department said in urging poultry owners to implement every strategy necessary to protect their flocks. Bird flu can spread in various ways, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers, the department said. We are strongly encouraging all flock owners to take steps to better protect their poultry and help reduce the spread of this disease. Now is the time for action, State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland said. The department recommends preventing contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed, washing hands and disinfecting gear before and after handling birds and when moving between different coops. It also recommends keeping poultry feed secure to ensure no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources said March 24 that bird flu had been detected in free-ranging Canada geese and tundra swans from St. Clair County, in snowy owls from Macomb County and in a mute swan from Monroe County.

Since February, at least 36 bald eagles have died from the bird flu across the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The escalating bird-flu outbreak is one of the worst in the U.S. in several years, according to the Agriculture Department, spreading along Florida, up the East Coast and as far west as Colorado and the Dakotas. The highly contagious disease is also hitting egg-laying flocks of chickens, as well as commercially raised turkeys, leading to a surge in egg and turkey breast prices. For the bald eagle, the outbreak comes as the population faces another deadly problem: a high incidence of lead poisoning. A study published in February found population growth rates for bald eagles are being suppressed by 3.8% because of lead exposure. Lead, a neurotoxin, has many sublethal effects on eagles that affect their health and ability to defend their territory and produce eggs. \"It's concerning,\" said Victoria Hall, executive director at the Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota. \"You're pairing a population who's already dealing with a lead toxicity problem now with highly pathogenic avian influenza.\" In recent weeks, 12 bald eagles with bird flu have arrived at the Raptor Center. The eagles, who were otherwise at their prime age for breeding, were at the end-stage of the virus and suffered from issues like seizures and being unable to stand, according to Dr. Hall. Humane euthanasia was the best option for them at that stage, she said. \"We're seeing more bald eagles die from high-path avian influenza than we've previously documented in any outbreak of this virus,\" Dr. Hall said. \"And it's interesting, because many of these birds also have lead poisoning.\" About 85% to 90% of eagles brought to the center have levels of lead in the blood and about 25% to 30% have lethal levels, Dr. Hall said. Eagles are hunters, but they also scavenge, including on dead animals and bits of carcass shot and left behind by human hunters. Most hunting ammunition is made of lead, and bullets can fragment when entering an animal's body, possibly contaminating remains. \"Right now I don't think we can say anything except both lead toxicity and HPAI were present in some of the birds,\" said Dr. Hall. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month the bird-flu outbreak poses a low risk to the general public, as it is predominantly an issue among animals. Human infections from bird-flu viruses are rare, according to the CDC. Bald eagles were removed from the federal list of endangered species in 2007. Their population in the lower 48 states has grown from 72,434 individual birds, including 30,548 breeding pairs, in 2009, to 316,700 individual eagles, including 71,467 breeding pairs, between 2018 and 2019, according to a report from the Interior Department last year. It is unclear what the broader and long-term impact of this bird-flu outbreak on the bald eagle's population will be as it is still under way, Dr. Hall said. \"We are seeing significant mortality,\" she said, \"and the better data we can collect about what is happening in these populations, the better we can figure out how we can best support them.\" Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 4}, {"key": "affirm_keyword_statement_1", "statement": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month the bird-flu outbreak poses a low risk to the general public, as it is predominantly an issue among animals.

The CDC recently extended the mask mandate until May 3 to allow more time to study the BA.2 omicron subvariant of the coronavirus that is now responsible for the vast majority of cases in the U.S. The mask requirement for travelers was the target of months of lobbying from the airlines, which sought to kill it. The carriers argued that effective air filters on modern planes make transmission of the virus during a flight unlikely. Republicans in Congress also fought to kill the mandate.

Lviv sees first war casualties in Russian airstrike Airstrikes by Russia's military killed at least seven people and injured 11 more including one child early Monday in Lviv in western Ukraine, regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said. Kozytskyy said four rockets were fired, striking three targets, including several warehouses not used by Ukraine's military, and a service station near Lviv Railway Station. The deaths were the first to be reported in the city since Russia's assault on Ukraine began in late February. Overnight blasts were also reported in Ukraine's capital Kyiv, in the north in Kharkiv and in Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea port city of Odesa, as Russia reinforces its invading force.

{"id": "131", "fulltext": "The price of eggs has soared in recent weeks in part because of a huge bird flu wave that has infected nearly 27 million chickens and turkeys in the United States, forcing many farmers to 'depopulate' or destroy their animals to prevent a further spread. The virus has impacted many different bird species, including penguins and bald eagles. But its spread among poultry has been tremendous, particularly among chickens raised for their eggs. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced yet another outbreak, this one in two flocks in Idaho, making that the 27th state in which the virus has been found since February. According to the USDA, the price of a dozen eggs in November hovered around $1. Right now, that price is $2.95 and rising. The illness affects commercial birds, hobbyists' backyard chicken flocks and wild birds, and is spread via secretions and leads to paralysis, swelling and diminished egg production. There have been no human cases of these avian influenza viruses detected in the United States. So far, about 1.3 percent of all U.S. chickens have been affected in this outbreak and about 6 percent of the U.S. turkey flock, said Grady Ferguson, senior research analyst for Gro Intelligence, an agriculture data platform. Ferguson tracked the last major outbreak of bird flu in 2015, saying that this outbreak has the potential to be more significant and disruptive to the poultry and egg markets. During the last epidemic, at this point in the outbreak, 66 days after first detection, the percentage of total chickens affected was 0.02 percent, ultimately climbing to around 2.5 percent of chickens infected and 50 million birds destroyed. 'We are above and beyond the rate of spread we saw in 2015,' Ferguson said. 'Last time, 81 percent of the cases were in the fourth and fifth month, as things exploded. What chicken egg prices did last time affected the market for years. We are two months into the outbreak now, and the safety protocols haven't worked. I don't want to be a Chicken Little, but I think it's going to be worse than last time.' He said in addition to higher prices for a carton of a dozen eggs, consumers 'will see higher prices for all baked goods and a wide variety of processed foods from cupcakes to salad dressing. Restaurants are going to have a harder time justifying why they should give you a three-egg omelet for a dollar. And on the chicken meat side, the situation is also worse this time than it was last time.' The majority of birds that had to be destroyed last time were laying hens and pullets (these are sexually immature birds that will be layers) and very few broilers (the birds consumers eat) were affected, Ferguson said. Thus far in this outbreak, 9 percent of affected animals are broiler chickens, he said, which will lead to already-high prices for chicken going even higher. Tom Super, senior vice president of communications for the National Chicken Council, said that chicken farmers are 'doubling and tripling down' on biosecurity at chicken farms, adding protocols like showers for workers as they enter and exit a facility, and antiseptic tire baths for trucks so that infection isn't moved from one facility to another. Super said that avian flu will add to the cost of chicken, but that is just one of several price pressures right now. He lists higher feed costs for animals, higher fuel costs for transporting animals and even the Biden administration's decision to allow higher levels of ethanol in gasoline, which further drives up the price of corn and soy essential for animal feed. Emily Metz, president of the American Egg Board, said that about 5 percent of laying hen flocks have been affected so far, but that she is more optimistic about the trajectory of this outbreak. 'The bottom line is we started a little bit earlier than we did in 2015 [with biosecurity protocols],' she said. 'We learned some tough lessons in 2015, that our biosecurity wasn't where it needed to be. We've invested in huge changes.' She described high-tech new protocols such as laser light systems to ward off migratory birds to prevent them from landing on the farmland or buildings. And while she admits prices are rising, she points to farmers' input costs as a greater factor than the specter of avian flu. 'It is alarming, and I share in the concern about affordability. But eggs are still one of the most affordable proteins, bar none,' she said.

{"id": "132", "fulltext": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) Several members of a backyard flock of birds in Utah County have tested positive for avian influenza as reports of the virus emerge in wild birds and farmed poultry throughout the United States. The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food said Monday that officials had euthanized an unspecified number of infected birds to prevent them from entering the food system. They cordoned off the area where they had lived. Proper steps have been taken to prevent further spread of the disease, said Utah State Veterinarian Dr. Dean Taylor. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed that detection of the avian flu did not present immediate concerns to humans, public health or the food system. However, they warned poultry owners to prevent their flocks from coming into contact with wild birds and monitor for sickness or unusual deaths. Though not an immediate health risk, reports of the virus can raise fears among the poultry industry of an outbreak that could decimate their stock. More cases also increase the likelihood that the virus could mutate and infect humans. Similar cases have been detected in Idaho, Pennsylvania, Montana, Colorado and Texas this month.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 4}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 5}]}
{"id": "133", "fulltext": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) Minnesota's governor and U.S. senators went to the heart of the state's poultry country Tuesday for a first-hand look at how the top turkey-producing state is fighting bird flu, and said the state is better positioned now than it was during the devastating 2015 outbreak. Gov. Tim Walz and Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith visited an emergency operations center in Willmar where state and federal agencies are working to contain the current outbreak. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says it has cost chicken and turkey producers 28.2 million birds in 29 states so far. In Minnesota, the toll is nearly 2 million birds at 40 farms. We remain hopeful. The fight is still on. We've got another four to six weeks probably, maybe a little shorter if we get some decent weather here, Walz said at a news conference. Klobuchar pointed out that Minnesota producers lost 9 million birds in 2015, mostly turkeys but also broiler and egg-laying chickens. Officials and the industry have learned a lot since then about how the virus is transmitted and they know better how to ward it off. And while the system for compensating farmers was just a mess last time, she said, that process has been improved. Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen said Minnesota saw a steady increase in new cases in May 2015 before they started winding down. The state may not be halfway through this new outbreak, he said, but it's behaving differently. State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said this outbreak is being spread mostly by wild waterfowl, not flock-to-flock as in 2015. Commercial and backyard flock owners have stepped up biosecurity to prevent tracking it from barn to barn, she said, and that should limit the number of affected farms. Relief is expected to come when those migrating waterfowl make their way through the Midwest, she said. Bad weather has caused many of them to stop in the region and leave the virus behind. Officials can't make those birds leave, she said, but they will head north as the weather improves. The environment needs to warm up, and we need to heat up, and we need to dry out, Thompson said. The leaders also said more mental health services are now available to help producers and farm workers cope with the stresses and financial shocks from having to destroy entire flocks. Everybody needs help at one time or another, and asking for help is a sign of strength, not of weakness, Smith said.

{"id": "134", "fulltext": "Among the latest victims of the bird flu outbreak sweeping across the country: the national bird of the United States. Bird flu virus strikes Here are where bald eagles testing positive for the bird flu virus have died, and how many died in each state, according to USDA data as of Thursday: Florida: 9 Georgia: 3 Kansas: 2 Maine: 2 Minnesota: 2 Nebraska: 1 North Carolina: 3 North Dakota: 2 Ohio: 2 Pennsylvania: 1 South Carolina: 3 South Dakota: 3 Vermont: 3 Wisconsin: 1 Bald eagles in 14 states died after contracting bird flu, and eagles in another two states are suspected of falling ill with the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In total, 36 bald eagles have died since February. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources reported Thursday that three bald eagles in the state that died recently tested positive for the bird flu virus. Other dead bald eagles also will be tested. Officials said recent aerial surveys of eagle nests on the state's coast revealed several failed nests, including eaglets dead or missing when they normally wouldn't have left the nest yet. Bob Sargent, program manager with the department's wildlife conservation section, said nest success is down about 30% this year. On April 8, a bald eagle in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was found unable to fly. Wildlife rehabilitators with the Wisconsin Humane Society collected and cared for the bird in Milwaukee. It was euthanized the next day after its condition deteriorated. Initial test results on the eagle released Friday showed it was 'presumed positive' for the virus. Tens of millions of domestic and wild birds have died or were euthanized as a result of the disease, which is especially deadly to domestic poultry. It has been detected in 32 states as of Saturday, most recently Utah and Idaho. The bird flu is considered a low risk to humans, but Americans are feeling the effects. The outbreak is expected to raise the cost of poultry products and eggs this year. Shoppers can expect to pay 6% to 7% more for poultry products and 2.5% to 3.5% for eggs at the grocery store.

{"id": "135", "fulltext": "With food prices rising rapidly, Francine Eubanks wasn't even aware a highly contagious avian flu spreading across the country had suddenly edged egg costs higher for her busy bagel shop. But her customers, like many across the country, are paying more for the bagels, knishes and pastries at her Bagel King deli in Deltona, Florida. 'I just raised my prices about four days ago,' Eubanks said last week. 'I watch my profit and loss really closely, and when I see it going in the wrong direction, I raise my prices. Everybody has to pay more. It's just sad.' Egg prices more than doubled nationally in March, according to the Urner Barry Egg Index, a blend of egg values in the wholesale market. That's in part because of the drastic measures taken to try to curb the spread of the mutating bird flu virus, the worst outbreak since 2014-2015. More than 24 million domestic chickens, turkey and other domestic birds have been killed in the U.S. since February. While the risk to people is low with this outbreak, scientists have rising concerns about the increasing threats of animal-borne viruses spreading to people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends farmers, poultry workers and hunters take steps to protect themselves and contain the virus. No human cases have been documented from this strain of the avian flu in the U.S., and only one was reported in Europe, said Todd Davis, lead of the CDC's zoonotic virus team in virology surveillance. Eating poultry and eggs is safe, as long as they are fully cooked, the CDC said. BIRD FLU: Bald eagles in 14 states have died amid bird flu outbreak OUTBREAK: Zoos are sequestering birds as avian flu spreads across North America Among birds, avian flu can be deadly and spread rapidly. When it's detected in a commercial poultry flock, federal rules require the birds to be killed to try to 'tamp out' the virus, said Bryan Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center. One Iowa farm laid off more than 200 employees after an outbreak forced the destruction of 5.3 million laying hens. The farm deaths ignited protests among animal rights activists. A woman quickly dubbed 'Blue Girl' was removed from an NBA game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Los Angeles Clippers on April 13 after she sprayed adhesive on the court and tried to glue herself to the floor to protest the euthanasia of birds on a farm belonging to Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor. Zoos in at least a half dozen states have shuttered aviaries to protect their birds. Backyard flock owners are keeping their chickens in and trying to keep wild waterfowl out of farm ponds to protect their birds. After the virus was reported in 41 countries during the latter half of 2021, U.S. and Canadian officials were on high alert, swabbing live birds and ducks taken by hunters to monitor for it, Richards said. This strain of the avian flu made its first appearance in North America in late November, in great black backed gulls in Newfoundland, where birds sometimes land after being blown across the Atlantic from Europe. By April 18, the virus had taken flight in the U.S. and was reported in more than 230 counties in 37 states and at least six Canadian provinces. In addition to domestic chickens, turkeys and ducks, USGS data shows at least 32 species of wild birds have been infected in the U.S., including bald eagles, snowy owls, swans and white pelicans. This virus is not related to the still unidentified pathogen that made songbirds sick last year, Richards said. Maps of the outbreak this spring showed the flu moving along the Missouri River basin, 'very clearly on the wings' of migrating waterfowl, Richards said. But the timing was fortunate because the flu began spreading just as the birds were dispersing, rather than being gathered in large winter congregations that could be 'virus factories,' he said. An outbreak in Israel where 40,000 common cranes were gathered killed 8,000 of them in a matter of weeks. Scientists are monitoring avian flu and other pathogens in animals more closely than ever because of the rising threat the viruses could spread to people, or back and forth between people and animals, mutating into different strains as they go. The opportunities for new emerging pathogens to appear and spill over into people has increased in recent decades, researchers said. For example, Richards pointed to the COVID-19 virus, which was found in a host of captive and wild animals, including lions, tigers, gorillas, cats, dogs, deer and mink. 'We've created opportunities where wildlife, humans and domestic animals literally share time and space,' he said. 'Pathogens can leverage those opportunities.' That potential has prompted calls from some scientists to strengthen reporting techniques and information sharing around the world to minimize the risk of another global pandemic. This H5 strain of the avian flu has been evolving in the world's birds since the late 1990s, mutating and swapping genes with other avian influenza, said the CDC's Davis. One version of the virus has caused 863 human infections in 18 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. Of those, 455 were fatal. The strain circulating now lacks genetic characteristics associated with human infection. While catastrophic to poultry, the CDC considers the risk low to humans. The single European case was a person with no symptoms and prolonged exposure to ducks that lived indoors, Davis said. People who may be exposed by handling wild birds or working in affected commercial operations should be aware of the potential for infection and take extra precautions. For example, hunters and individuals handling wild birds should wash their hands. People working to decontaminate poultry farms are advised to wear N95 face masks and gloves, and in some cases protective gowns. Davis said these people should also get tested if they experience any flu symptoms. 'There's still things we don't know,' such as the overall potential for exposure, he said. 'So we want to be extra cautious, especially with the highly pathogenic strains.' INDIANA FARM: Bird flu found on poultry farm in Indiana, nearly 30,000 turkeys killed to contain spread Dead birds should be reported to state wildlife hotlines and bird watchers have been advised to avoid spreading mud from wetlands and swampy areas with their boots, cars and equipment. American Poultry Association members who raise birds for enjoyment and show have also worked to protect their flocks from exposure, said David Adkins, secretary/treasurer and a competition judge. Georgia state officials canceled the association's semi-annual show in February. Similar shows and fair exhibitions have been canceled in at least five states, including Iowa, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Adkins said he feels bad for youths in 4-H and Future Farmers of America chapters who haven't been able to display the poultry they've raised. Using toy stuffed birds to demonstrate their showmanship just isn't the same, he said: 'It's hard on those kids when they spent the time raising their project.' Richards and other scientists hope to see the impacts of the virus diminish as spring migration comes to a close. And they hope this outbreak doesn't match the 2014-15 season, when 50 million birds were killed. That outbreak didn't start in domestic poultry until April, and already this time the virus has been found in twice as many wild bird species and several times the number of individual wild birds.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 17}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 21}]}

It can infect a variety of birds, including chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, wild birds and domestic birds. The risk for people is considered to be low. 'If you’re concerned about this virus and want to act from a place of abundant caution, removing your bird feeders for now makes sense but it isn’t yet a critical step,' said Megan Moriarty, a state wildlife veterinarian. 'With warmer springtime weather on the way, too, birds will have more natural food sources readily available to them, so chances are many people will be taking down feeders in a few weeks anyway,' Moriarty said Wednesday.

{"id": "138", "fulltext": "The H5N1 strain of avian influenza is spreading among many raptors and wild birds, including the national bird. With millions of chickens on commercial poultry farms sickened and dying from a highly virulent strain of avian flu in recent months, it might have escaped notice that some of the nation's most stunning wild birds have also been felled by the virus. The virus has taken an unusual toll on raptors or birds of prey, including more than three dozen bald eagles. Because the spring is nesting season, some experts are worried that avian flu may pose a serious threat to the birds' potential offspring. In Minneapolis, a beloved family of great horned owls living by Lake Nokomis has died of avian flu. In Florida, black vultures have been infected. And in Georgia, three infected bald eagles were found dead in coastal counties. The H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, which is widespread in Europe, was first reported in North America in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador in December 2021. By mid-January, the virus had infected an American wigeon and blue-winged teal in South Carolina, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Waterfowl, which are natural hosts of avian flu, have been especially hard hit. The 763 reported wild bird infections, according to the U.S.D.A., include snow geese in North and South Dakota, northern shovelers in North Carolina, brown pelicans in Florida, mallards in Minnesota and several unidentified ducks in Ohio. Bald eagles hunt living prey and scavenge carcasses, which offer a possible route of transmission for the virus. 'If the waterfowl are dying, then eagles can pick it up from eating those dead waterfowl,' said Krysten Schuler, the co-director of the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab. The U.S.D.A. has reported 41 dead bald eagles infected with the virus since February, a number that does not include two more bald eagles that Dr. Schuler confirmed were infected in New York in late March, she said. This month, bald eagles have been infected in Ohio, South Dakota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Vermont, Maine and North Dakota. Bald eagles have long been considered a conservation success story. Populations were driven nearly to extinction by the synthetic insecticide DDT: In 1963, there were only 417 known nesting pairs. But decades of conservation efforts, along with a 1972 ban of DDT, allowed the species to recover and eventually be removed from Endangered Species Act protection in 2007. Despite this rebound, many bald eagles suffer from chronic lead poisoning. As the birds scavenge on hunted carcasses, they can ingest lead from ammunition, according to a paper published this year in the journal Science. This widespread, long-term exposure stressed the resilience of bald eagle populations, according to a study published this year by Dr. Schuler and colleagues in The Journal of Wildlife Management. New threats to the species, such as wind turbines or a bird flu strain, could threaten its long-term success. 'The resilience of these animals was very close to the edge,' Dr. Schuler said. 'If a few more breeding adults died, that could actually have a pretty big impact on the future growth of these populations.' It is not yet clear how this bird flu will affect the species' recovery. 'I'm concerned it will be endemic, and there's already been reports of some recombination, which means there's this new strain mixing with some of the North American versions we have and creating new viruses,' Dr. Schuler said. 'We always worry about those.' But it appears the virus will harm nesting success — the ability of a nest to produce at least one young bird capable of flight — among certain populations this year, according to a statement from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Aerial surveys of nesting bald eagles in six coastal counties in Georgia have revealed nest success was down 30 percent this year, according to the statement. Some wild birds infected with avian influenza can show no symptoms, but infection can also lead to neurological problems, which can make it difficult for a bird to fly or right itself. At Back to the Wild, a rehabilitation center in Ohio, bald eagles believed to have bird flu appear unsteady on their feet and are unable to fly; some have even had seizures. 'All are admitted with the same symptoms and pass away within hours of admission,' said Heather Tuttle, the director of education at the center, adding that the rate of admission has started to slow down. Of the dozen brought into the center, none have survived. There is no effective treatment. Avian flu poses little threat to people, and no cases of H5N1 bird flu infection have been reported in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People should avoid direct contact with wild birds and their feces, and hunters should avoid harvesting or handling wild birds that are sick or found dead. Hunters should also wash their hands with soap and water after touching game birds and cook meat to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Some experts have advised people to take down bird feeders to reduce the spread of H5N1 in wild birds. But Dr. Schuler has not seen many birds that use feeders, such as songbirds, infected with the virus. 'So it doesn't seem like that is a major source of potential transmission,' she said. But bird feeders can still spread other pathogens and parasites, such as the bacteria that cause house finch eye disease, so it is still important to keep them clean. Instead, Dr. Schuler suggests maintaining vigilance about the spread of bird flu and reporting any unusual mortalities or birds that appear to have neurological issues.

{"id": "139", "fulltext": "DETROIT—With more cases of bird flu detected in wild and domestic birds across Michigan, the Department of Natural Resources suggests Michiganders take down their bird feeders and birdbaths out of an abundance of caution. Birds flock to Michigan in April and May as they migrate through the Great Lakes region after wintering in Central and South America. Migrating species, such as the colorful yellow-rumped warbler or the soaring broad-winged hawk, may seek out food sources in backyard bird feeders, causing some Michigan birders to worry about spreading avian influenza, also known as the highly pathogenic avian influenza. Bird flu was first detected in Michigan in late February. Birds at the Detroit Zoo were moved indoors in response to protect from bird flu exposure. More recent cases of bird flu have cropped up across the state. Positive sample of bird flu: More than 32,000 turkeys in North Carolina euthanized Bird flu outbreak: Bald eagles in 14 states have died Megan Moriarty, DNR state wildlife veterinarian, said in a statement that bird species vary in how likely they are to die from bird flu infection. While all birds are potentially susceptible to bird flu, domestic birds, such as chickens, cockatoos, or doves, are more vulnerable to fatal infection. In addition, some wild bird populations, like waterfowl, raptors and scavengers, are highly susceptible and have been particularly affected by this disease, Moriarty said in the statement. Songbirds appear less prone to bird flu, although Moriarty noted that testing of songbirds is limited and much is still unknown. If you’re concerned about this virus and want to act from a place of abundant caution, removing your bird feeders, for now, makes sense, but it isn’t yet a critical step, Moriarty said. With warmer springtime weather on the way, too, birds will have more natural food sources readily available to them. Bird feeder removal could be wise for those who see blue jays, crows, or ravens in their backyard because those species are deemed at high risk of bird flu. Birdbaths are also places for birds to come in contact and spread bird flu, and the DNR suggests temporarily removing baths until the HPAI bird flu spread in wild and domestic birds decreases, which may be months or longer. For those who wish to keep their bird feeders in place, Moriarty suggested a number of steps to reduce the spread of bird flu. Clean bird feeders with a diluted bleach solution (and rinse well) once per week. Regularly cleaning helps protect birds against other infections, including salmonella. Clean up birdseed that has fallen below the feeders to discourage large numbers of birds and other wildlife from congregating in a concentrated area. Don’t feed wild birds, especially waterfowl, near domestic flocks.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "More than 32,000 turkeys in North Carolina euthanized Bird flu outbreak: Bald eagles in 14 states have died"}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 2}]}
{"id": "140", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) Is it OK for free-range chickens to not range freely? That's a question free-range egg producers have been pondering lately as they try to be open about their product while also protecting chickens from a highly infectious bird flu that has resulted in the death of roughly 28 million poultry birds across the country. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that chickens be moved indoors to protect against the disease, but while some are keeping their hens inside, not everyone agrees. John Brunnquell, the CEO of Indiana-based Egg Innovations, which contracts with more than 50 farms in five states to produce free-range and pasture-raised eggs, said any of his chickens in states with bird flu cases will stay in confinement mode until the risk passes. We will keep them confined at least until early June, Brunnquell said. If we go four weeks with no more commercial breakouts then we'll look to get the girls back out. Bird flu cases have been identified in commercial chicken and turkey farms or in backyard flocks in 29 states, according to the USDA. Spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings of infected migrating wild birds. The farms Brunnquell contracts with are in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Wisconsin, all of which have had at least once case of bird flu. But some, like Mike Badger, the executive director of the American Pastured Poultry Producers Association, are taking a different approach. Badger, whose Pennsylvania-based nonprofit group has about 1,000 members across the country, believes birds kept outdoors are at less risk of infection than chickens and turkeys raised amid thousands of others in large, enclosed barns. We put them outside and they get in touch with the environment so I think they have a better immune system to be able to fight off threats as they happen, Badger said. Research has not clearly proven significant immune system differences in chickens housed outdoors versus indoors. And Badger speculates that lower density of animals, air movement and less sharing of equipment and staff in pasture-raised operations may contribute to a lack of virus infections. He said the decision whether to bring hens inside to wait out the annual migration of wild waterfowl is a farm-to-farm decision based on the comfort level with the risk acceptance. Commercial outdoor flocks make up only a small percentage of U.S. egg production. About 6 million hens, or 2% of national flock, are free-range and about 4.2 million hens, or 1.3% of U.S. egg production, are from pasture-raised chickens. Chickens are categorized as free-range or pasture-raised primarily by the amount of time they spend outdoors and space they are provided. Free-range chickens typically must have at least 21.8 square feet (2 square meters) of roaming space outdoors and remain out until temperatures drop below around 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 1 Celsius), according to the American Humane Association, which certifies egg operations. Pasture-raised chickens typically must have 108 square feet (10 square meters) outdoors each and remain outside most of the year except during inclement weather. The certifying organizations have protocols for high-risk situations and allow for temporary housing indoors a time period not specifically defined once a farm documents an outbreak near an outdoor flock. Certification agencies monitor farms to ensure they don't use bird flu as an excuse to keep birds inside too long. Brunnquell said none of his farms had infections during the last big outbreak in 2015, and he hasn't had any cases this year. Farmers in Europe have been dealing with the bird virus longer than those in the U.S., with cases reported as early as last December. The United Kingdom has ordered free-range hens to be housed inside to protect them from the avian flu, and that has forced changes to how those eggs are labeled in stores. Free-range packaging is still used but must be marked with an added label of barn eggs, according to a communications representative for the British Free Range Egg Producers Association. Each egg also is stamped with a No. 2 that denotes barn rather than No. 1 for free-range. For U.S. consumers, it means the free-range eggs they buy at a premium price could come from a chicken being temporarily kept inside. But producers say they think people who pay more for pasture-raised or free-range eggs have animal-welfare concerns and don't want the chickens to be endangered by the virus. Brunnquell also noted that the certification agencies monitor farms to ensure they don't use bird flu as an excuse to keep birds inside too long. Eggs of all kinds have grown costlier recently thanks to bird flu concerns and a national spike in food costs. Last week, prices for conventional eggs increased by 40 cents per dozen to $1.47 while cage-free egg prices rose 3 cents to $2.40 per dozen, according to the USDA. Organic eggs, which are from chickens required to have access to the outdoors, were selling for a national average of $4.39 a dozen last week, up from $3.65 the week before. The price of eggs used by bakeries and other food products soared to a record high on April 8. So-called breaker eggs, which will later be broken by processors and sold in containers weighing up to 50 pounds, peaked at $2.51 per pound, said Karyn Rispoli, egg market reporter for Urner Barry, a New Jersey-based food commodity market research and analytics firm. Many of the egg layers that have died from bird flu were on farms contracted to provide breaker eggs used as food product ingredients, Rispoli said. Bird flu likely will remain a problem for at least several more weeks as migrating waterfowl will remain on the move in the Mississippi Flyway until June. In the past, warmer weather and the end of migration brought an end to bird flu cases, allowing turkey and chicken farmers to begin the monthslong process of replenishing flocks and resuming production. ___ Associated Press writer Courtney Bonnell contributed to this report from London. ___ This story was first published on April 21.

{"id": "141", "fulltext": "Experts say widespread transmission of flu in birds is increasing scope for avian viruses to mix and mutate. An H3N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, in China's central province of Henan. The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China's National Health Commission. Avian influenza or bird flu as it is commonly known is a highly contagious viral disease with the first reports of human cases in the 1990s. Some strains of the bird flu, such as with H3N8 now, have been passed to humans but this is currently very rare, and usually occurs after very close contact with infected birds or animals. H3N8 viruses circulate widely in birds and in horses and have also been detected in dogs in North America. 'We often see a virus spread to a human and then not spread any further so a single case is not a cause of great concern,' said Sir Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health, University of Oxford. 'There is no reason to think it will go any further,' said Prof Paul Digard from the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, adding that Chinese authorities had not reported any illness in the immediate contacts of the infected boy. However, Horby and other disease experts said the widespread transmission and record number of outbreaks of avian flu in birds across the UK, US and Europe this year was a cause of concern as it increased the opportunity for avian viruses to mix and mutate and for human infection. 'I do generally believe we need to be increasing influence surveillance globally quite concertedly right now. Apart from H3N8, we have seen a number of other new spillover events of influenza from poultry to people over recent years including H5N8 in Russia and H7N9 and H10N3 in China,' said Alexandra Phelan, assistant professor at the centre for global health science and security at Georgetown University. Marius Gilbert, an epidemiologist at the Université libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, said a novel virus should always be looked at very carefully, 'especially when it is a reassortant, as it can have unpredictable capacity in terms of transmission and virulence in human populations.' Dr John McCauley, from the World Health Organization collaborating centre for reference and research on influenza, said the case was an 'unusual one' and was being investigated by the WHO and its counterparts in the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. In the UK, consumers can no longer buy free-range eggs, with birds not having been allowed outdoors since November due to close to 100 outbreaks of avian flu. However, there have been fewer than five cases of transmission from an infected bird to a human recorded in the UK, most recently in January, when a man caught it from ducks he kept inside his home.

If handling wild birds or poultry, wear gloves and wash your hands when done. People may also wear a face mask and goggles if possible. In February, the avian flu was first detected in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

{"id": "145", "fulltext": "A man in Colorado is the first human in the U.S. to test positive for bird flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday. The case comes as the H5N1 bird influenza tears through the U.S., posing a low risk to humans while leading to the deaths of millions of birds. Some of the birds have died from the disease, but the vast majority of them are being culled to curb the spread. The patient, who is younger than 40, was involved in the culling of presumptively infected poultry at a commercial farm in Colorado's Montrose County, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. He is an inmate at a state correctional facility in Delta County and was working with poultry as part of a pre-release employment program. Members of the response team were all given personal protective equipment while working on the farm, and the affected flock has been euthanized. The patient has since recovered after reporting fatigue that lasted a few days as his only symptom. He was treated with oseltamivir, an antiviral influenza medication commonly sold under the Tamiflu brand. The virus was detected on a single nasal specimen and could have been present in the patient's nose without causing infection, according to a statement from Colorado authorities. This case marks the second human case associated with this group of H5 viruses—the first case occurred in the U.K. in December 2021, according to the CDC. The first patient lived with a large number of birds that became infected with H5N1, according to the World Health Organization. Still, for the general public, the human risk of bird flu remains low, the CDC says. Those who have job-related or recreational exposure to infected birds are at higher risk for infection. \"We want to reassure Coloradans that the risk to them is low,\" said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist, in the statement.

The unidentified person had direct contact with poultry and was working to destroy birds believed to have a version of H5N1 bird flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday. The person's only symptom was fatigue, the agency said. An earlier case in December in the U.K. was in an asymptomatic person who also had contact with infected birds. The CDC said it believes the risk to the general public is low. It said it is possible that the positive test was the result of surface contamination. Other people also involved in the same bird-destroying operation in Colorado have tested negative but are being retested out of caution, the CDC said. Health authorities are on guard because this strain has hit tens of millions of birds, from commercial flocks to wild birds, in at least 34 states. The rapidly spreading bird flu, the worst in seven years, has killed at least 11 million egg-laying chickens among other birds and driven up U.S. egg prices.

{"id": "147", "fulltext": "A case of avian influenza in a person in Colorado demonstrates why poultry companies are working to contain the potentially deadly pathogen, infectious-disease experts said, though the risk of broader spread in people remains low. The man who tested positive for bird flu was an inmate at a state correctional facility in Delta County who was exposed to infected birds while working at a commercial farm in Montrose County, Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment said. He reported only one symptom of fatigue and recovered after a few days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Outbreaks of avian influenza have killed wild birds including dozens of bald eagles and lead to death through sickness or culling of tens of millions of poultry raised for meat and eggs in recent months. 'It spreads very quickly in poultry, makes poultry very sick, and can be lethal,' said Troy Sutton, an assistant professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Pennsylvania State University. The high transmissibility of this version of H5N1 among poultry and the increase in cases from late 2021 into this year had raised concerns among officials and disease experts of potential exposure to humans in the U.S., Dr. Sutton said. The risk to most people remains low, the CDC said on Thursday, but the agency advised people who work in proximity to infected birds to take extra precautions including wearing gloves, medical face masks and goggles. People in close contact with infected birds can be exposed to the virus through a bird's saliva, mucus and feces. 'When there is human infection with these viruses, often it can be severe,' said Richard Webby, member of the department of infectious diseases at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. 'The case fatality rate is much higher with this virus than it is for a typical seasonal, human influenza infection.' Among over 800 detected human cases of H5N1 globally from 2003 to March 2022, the case fatality rate was 53%, according to the World Health Organization. Most deaths associated with H5N1 viruses were caused by severe pneumonia and a collapse of the respiratory system, Dr. Webby said.

{"id": "148", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Colorado prison inmate has become the first person in the U.S. to test positive for bird flu in a recent outbreak that has led to the deaths of millions of chickens and turkeys, but federal officials say they still see little threat to the general public. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday evening that the infected man had been in a prerelease program and was helping to remove chickens from an infected farm. The man, who was under age 40, reported fatigue for a few days but has recovered, state health and CDC officials said in a statement. The man was isolated and is being treated with an antiviral drug. Other people involved in the bird removal operation in Colorado have tested negative, but they are being retested out of an abundance of caution. The man was part of a crew of inmates nearing release who had been working at the farm before a case of bird flu was confirmed there on April 19, said Lisa Wiley, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Corrections. When bird flu was detected at the farm in Montrose County, the inmates were asked to help kill and remove the birds. Agriculture officials have reported an outbreak at one Montrose County farm with 58,000 broiler breeder chickens. Despite the infection, the CDC considers the threat to the general public to be low because spread of the virus to people requires close contact with an infected bird. Signals that could raise the public health risk might include multiple reports of virus infections in people from exposure to birds, or identification of spread from one person to another. The CDC also is monitoring for genetic changes to the H5N1 bird flu virus that is currently circulating. Any genetic changes could indicate the virus is adapting to spread more readily from birds to people or other mammals. Many different bird flu viruses have infected humans worldwide since at least the 1990s, but health officials still say human infection is uncommon. In 2002, H7N2 caused pinkeye and mild respiratory symptoms in people in the U.K. and the U.S. Four U.S. infections have been identified since 2002; two were transmitted from cats to humans in 2016. More than 1,500 people in China have been infected with the H7N9 strain, largely in outbreaks between 2013 and 2017. This version caused serious infections among people and 40% of those who were hospitalized died. A different variant of H5N1 has also circulated since 1997, infecting more than 880 people, and it had a 50% case fatality rate. The current H5N1 variant has been spreading among backyard and commercial chicken and turkey flocks in the U.S. since late February. Viruses have been found in U.S. commercial and backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states. More than 35 million chickens and turkeys have been killed and removed to avoid spread, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported. The CDC said it has tracked the health of more than 2,500 people who have been exposed to H5N1-infected birds but that the inmate's illness was the only confirmed case to date. The agency said it was possible the man only had the virus present in his nose and that his body was not infected. Colorado public health officials say repeat testing on the man was negative for influenza. A nasal swab positive test result meets the agency's criteria for considering it an infection.

{"id": "149", "fulltext": "A type of the bird flu that has led to outbreaks in poultry in 30 states has been found in a person in Colorado, federal officials announced on Thursday. The case is the first known human infection of the bird flu currently spreading in the United States. The person had been working to destroy birds believed to have H5N1 bird flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The patient, who wasn't identified, reported feeling fatigued for a few days and has since recovered, the agency said. It said that the positive test might have been caused by surface contamination, but that the proper response was to assume that the person had been infected by a bird. Unlike the coronavirus, which has caused a global pandemic, scientists believe there is little risk of H5N1 spreading widely to humans. \"This case does not change the human risk assessment for the general public, which C.D.C. considers to be low,\" the agency said in a statement. Eating properly handled and cooked birds and eggs remains safe, it added. People whose work brings them in close contact with infected birds should be on alert, as they are at higher risk of infection, the C.D.C. said. The United States is in the midst of its worst bird flu season since 2015, when approximately 50 million chickens and turkeys had to be killed because of H5N2. The outbreaks that began in late 2021 were caused by the H5N1 virus, which has spread to 30 states and has led to the loss of 35.5 million birds as of Thursday, according to the Agriculture Department. Iowa has been hit the hardest, with the loss of about 13 million birds. Nebraska has lost about 5 million, and Pennsylvania about 4 million. The C.D.C. said that it was tracking the health of more than 2,500 people who have been exposed to H5N1-infected birds, and that it was retesting others who were involved in the same operation in Colorado as the infected person and previously tested negative for the virus. This is the second human case linked to this global outbreak of H5N1, experts said. In December, a person in Britain, who also had contact with infected birds, became infected but was asymptomatic. Infections of humans are rare, scientists said, but can happen when they are exposed to enough flu virus. Birds who are infected discharge the virus in their saliva, mucus and feces, putting people in close contact with them at risk. C.D.C. guidelines advise people who must handle birds, especially sick or dead poultry, to wear gloves, face masks and goggles. The current version of H5N1 is different from earlier H5N1 viruses that have led to more than 880 confirmed human infections since 2003 worldwide, the C.D.C. said. And it emphasized that the spread of earlier H5N1 viruses from an infected person to a close contact has happened only very rarely and did not lead to sustained person-to-person spread.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 6}, {"key": "affirm_evolve_statement_1", "statement": "The current version of H5N1 is different from earlier H5N1 viruses that have led to more than 880 confirmed human infections since 2003 worldwide, the C.D.C. said."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 14}, {"key": "deny_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "\"This case does not change the human risk assessment for the general public, which C.D.C. considers to be low,\" the agency said in a statement."}, {"key": "deny_evolve_statement_2", "statement": "\"This case does not change the human risk assessment for the general public, which C.D.C. considers to be low,\" the agency said in a statement."}, {"key": "deny_humanspread_statement_2", "statement": "\"This case does not change the human risk assessment for the general public, which C.D.C. considers to be low,\" the agency said in a statement."}, {"key": "deny_pandemic_statement_2", "statement": "\"This case does not change the human risk assessment for the general public, which C.D.C. considers to be low,\" the agency said in a statement."}]}
{"id": "150", "fulltext": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced late Thursday that a person in Colorado has tested positive for an H5 bird flu virus—the first such recorded infection in the United States. The CDC did not reveal the neuraminidase subtype of the virus—the N portion of an influenza A virus's name. The country is currently experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in both wild birds and in commercial poultry flocks. Authorities in Colorado are monitoring the health of about 10 people who were in contact with a man who tested positive for H5 bird flu when he was involved in culling poultry infected with the virus. The man, who is incarcerated at a state correctional facility and was taking part in a pre-release work program, is being considered the country’s first case of H5 bird flu. The people being monitored worked with him and shared transportation to the poultry operation. State Epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy said Friday that all the individuals have tested twice for the virus and all tests have been negative so far. They were all offered the flu antiviral Tamiflu, which can be used both to treat and prevent flu infections, though Herlihy wasn’t certain all had agreed to take it. They will be monitored for 10 days after their last exposure to the unidentified man, who she said had recovered from a very mild illness. “We’re being cautious,” Herlihy told STAT. “We’re using isolation, we’re using treatment, we’re monitoring contacts doing all of those things. But we continue to believe that the risk overall is low.” In reality, it’s not clear the man was infected. Workers who were culling the birds underwent daily symptom checks; on April 20, they were tested using nose swabs. On April 26, the state’s public health laboratory concluded the man had been infected with an influenza A virus, but it was unable to subtype the virus. The sample was then sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which confirmed on April 27 that the swab contained H5 virus. The subtyping of the neuraminidase—the N in the virus’s name—is still underway, but the presumption is that the birds and the man were infected with H5N1 viruses. The man was placed in isolation on April 26, after the state laboratory could not subtype the virus, Lisa Wiley, a public affairs officer for the Colorado Department of Corrections, said in an email. The move was taken out of an abundance of caution, she said. In interviews with public health officials after the fact, the man acknowledged feeling fatigued for a few days around the time the test was taken. But he reported none of the respiratory symptoms normally associated with flu. In a statement issued by the CDC on Thursday evening, the agency raised the possibility that the man may not have been infected—the swab may have just picked up the virus in his nostrils. But the positive test means he meets the definition of a case, the CDC said. “There’s some additional work that CDC can do, but we might not ever know if this was truly an infection or not,” said Herlihy. For years countries have been on high alert for H5N1 infections in people. In the mid-aughts, these viruses—labeled as highly pathogenic, because of their lethality to poultry—spread from Southeast Asia to South Asia and North Africa, leaving devastation in their wake. Millions of birds died from the virus or from the culling needed to stop the virus’s spread. And occasionally the virus jumped from poultry to people. In the past 20 years or so, roughly 880 people in 19 countries have been infected with H5N1. Just over half of them died. Fortunately, though, the virus to date has not acquired the capacity to spread easily from person to person and the fears that an H5N1 pandemic might be looming have faded. This case is unlikely to reignite them. The virus has changed over time, Todd Davis, who leads the CDC influenza division’s zoonotic virus team, said in an interview. The H5N1 viruses from 15 years ago or so had some different genes that appeared to allow them to trigger more severe illness when they infected people, he said. Those changes, particularly in the polymerase gene, are not present in most current day H5N1 viruses. And while the virus is still called H5N1, at a point a few years back it swapped genes with another flu virus, picking up a different neuraminidase. The new N1 is highly adapted to infect wild birds—speeding its recent spread through Europe, Africa and North America—but it seems less able now to infect people, Davis said. Since that reassortment event, the newly configured H5N1 has only been seen to have infected two people—a man in the United Kingdom last December and the man in Colorado. The U.K. man kept poultry and the virus found its way into his flock. Though he tested positive, he experienced no symptoms. “There have only been two detected human cases since the virus was first detected in 2018,” Davis said. “That’s also pretty good evidence that this virus is just not as capable of infecting or causing disease in humans.” Still, flu viruses change constantly, and public health officials do not take lightly human infections with non-human flu viruses. “Our challenge at the moment is trying to keep up with those hundreds of people who are involved in culling operations or disinfection of infected farms, and making sure that we don’t see any changes in the virus that might increase the propensity for severe illness or transmissibility,” Davis said. “We’re still very much on high alert.”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 12}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "For years countries have been on high alert for H5N1 infections in people.

{"id": "153", "fulltext": "The worst avian flu outbreak in years is ripping through the United States, leading to the deaths of more than 24 million birds. The H5N1 virus has ravaged commercial and backyard poultry in 29 states, with nearly 250 outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control. American consumers have felt the bird flu in the form of higher egg prices, which more than doubled in March. But on Thursday, the CDC reported the first human case of the current dominant bird flu virus in the United States. An inmate in Colorado contracted the flu after exposure while working at a poultry farm. Still, public health officials say the risk of transmission in the general public is low. Bird flu's economic impact: Worst bird flu in years drives up egg prices, prompts precautions against spread to humans What is the bird flu? The bird flu, also known as the avian flu, refers to the disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted between birds. The dominant virus strain circulating currently is called H5N1. It is extremely contagious among birds, who spread it by shedding the virus in their saliva, feces and through nasal secretions. The virus originates in wild birds, but can spread to domesticated birds and lead to rapid, massive outbreaks. Avian influenza viruses are classified into two groups: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high death rates in infected birds, according to the CDC. Bird Flu symptoms in humans While possible, avian flu virus infections in humans are considered rare. The human infection reported in Colorado is only the second confirmed human infection of the present outbreak in the world. The first confirmed infection was reported in December in a United Kingdom man who had ducks living inside his home. He presented no symptoms. The man infected in Colorado showed mild symptoms of fatigue and was given antiviral medication for treatment. In China, officials confirmed the infection of a 4-year-old boy with a different strain, H3N8, after he reported a fever. Chinese health officials said his close contacts tested negative and that the strain posed little threat of widespread. Bird flu symptoms have been reported to be largely the same as the seasonal flu. Symptoms can include cough, a sore throat, head and muscle aches, fatigue and shortness of breath. Severe infections can lead to pneumonia that requires hospitalizations. Sometimes infection can cause a fever. Less common symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization reported that 863 H5N1 cases have been confirmed globally in 18 countries since 2003, causing 455 deaths. But the H5N1 virus in circulation now is different from prior versions, the CDC said, and the risk posed by bird flu to the public's health is still low. Human to human transmission is rare. Even when people have been infected with bird flu viruses there has rarely been onward spread from one infected person to another person, the CDC website reads. Most people who become infected become so after close, prolonged and unprotected contact with infected birds. Bird Flu prevention The best personal bird flu prevention is steering clear of prolonged exposure to birds. For those who work in close contact with poultry, hunt, or keep birds of their own, the CDC recommends implementing extra precautions like wearing gloves, mask and eye protection.

{"id": "154", "fulltext": "Laborers worked for a month disposing of birds killed in a gruesomely inhumane manner. Then they found they too were disposable. Labourers at one of the world's largest egg factories arrived at the plant in Rembrandt, Iowa, early one morning in March to discover they were about to work themselves out of a job. As they gathered at the huge barns housing stacks of caged hens, the workers were told to forget about their usual routine of collecting eggs and feeding the birds. Overnight, the factory had begun slaughtering more than 5 million chickens using a gruesome killing method after detecting a single case of avian influenza. Even supervisors were assigned to the arduous task of dragging dead hens out of packed cages as Rembrandt Enterprises raced to contain the spread of the virus, amid the largest bird flu outbreak in the US in seven years. The culling has been repeated at chicken and turkey farms across Iowa and 28 other states from Maine to Utah. More than 22m birds have been killed in an attempt to contain the outbreak, the majority in Iowa, the US's biggest producer of eggs. The slaughter of 5.3m hens at Rembrandt is the largest culling at any factory farm in the country. Workers spent nearly a month pulling the dead poultry from the cages and dumping them in carts before they were piled high in nearby fields and buried in huge pits. The killing over, about 250 people were summarily thrown out of work with just a few dozen skeleton staff remaining. In the weeks that followed, animal rights protesters targeted Rembrandt's billionaire owner, Glen Taylor, over the cull, including disrupting games played by the professional basketball team he owns, the Minnesota Timberwolves. But few voices have been raised in support of Rembrandt's workers, some of them undocumented migrants. Others fired from the plant contrast the seriousness with which the bird flu outbreak has been taken by Rembrandt's management to what they describe as the company's lax approach to the threat to workers from Covid, as it swept through factory farms and slaughterhouses in Iowa and elsewhere. 'Right now everybody's worried about the chickens,' said Oscar Garcia, a former supervisor at the plant. 'We get it: it was really inhumane the way they killed them. But chickens are chickens, right? People worked in those barns pulling out dead birds in terrible conditions, faeces everywhere, doing 12- or 14-hour days. They couldn't protest because then they'd be fired and lose their redundancy pay. Then they're thrown out of work and no one speaks for them.' Outside criticism of Rembrandt has focused on the method of killing. Chicken farms have previously slaughtered hens en masse by suffocating them with foam or pumping barns full of carbon dioxide, methods that have been criticized as inhumane. But Tom Cullen of the Iowa newspaper the Storm Lake Times revealed that birds at Rembrandt were culled using a system known as ventilation shutdown plus (VSD+) in which air is closed off to the barns and heat pumped in until the temperature rises above 104F (40C). 'They cooked those birds alive,' said one of the Rembrandt workers involved in the culling. An animal rights group, Animal Outlook, used freedom of information laws to obtain records of experiments at North Carolina State University that show that VSD+ causes 'extreme suffering' to the hens as they 'writhe, gasp, pant, stagger and even throw themselves against the walls of their confinement in a desperate attempt to escape.' 'Eventually the birds collapse and, finally, die from heat and suffocation,' the group said. Members of another group, Direct Action Everywhere, have disrupted Timberwolves games in recent weeks wearing T-shirts proclaiming 'Glen Taylor Roasts Animals Alive.' James Roth, director of the Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University's college of veterinary medicine and an adviser to the federal government on biosecurity, acknowledged that VSD+ causes more suffering than other forms of culling, but said it is the most efficient means of containing the spread of bird flu because it is relatively swift. 'Nobody wants to see it used, but sometimes it is, as a last resort. The rationale is if the influenza virus spreads so fast that it'll go through a poultry house really rapidly, all of those birds produce massive amounts of virus in the air. Then you have a big plume of virus coming from that house that spreads to other poultry houses. It's critical to get the birds euthanised before that virus becomes a huge plume of virus to spread,' he said. Roth said that the authorities appear to have learned important lessons from 2015, when a bird flu outbreak resulted in what the US agriculture department calls 'the largest poultry health disaster in US history' with the slaughter of about 50 million chickens and turkeys. This time federal regulators moved quickly to contain the outbreak by shutting down the movement of workers between poultry flocks, a significant cause of the spread of avian flu in 2015. But Roth said this year the virus appears to have arrived in the US carried by waterfowl from Europe and to be better adapted to be spread by wild birds, which are harder to contain. That prompted the USDA to press for a swift culling at infected poultry farms. On 17 March, Rembrandt notified its supervisors that avian flu had been detected on the site. 'They sent out email at 10.30pm letting us know they had a confirmed case,' said a former Rembrandt worker who was obliged to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to receive redundancy payments. When the worker arrived the next day he discovered the company had already begun slaughtering millions of chickens. 'Once they're dead, we had to take them out by hand one by one, put them in a wheelbarrow. That's really intense manual labour. They are not very big cages. Twelve chickens are crammed in there. Awful conditions,' he said. 'After it was over, we were told to attend a meeting. We walked in. There was a big stack of yellow envelopes. That's like showing a knife to a chicken. You know what's going to happen next. We worked ourselves out of a job. I saw people who had years and years of experience just being let go. It was totally unexpected.' Some workers thought the layoff might be temporary, as it was during the 2015 outbreak. But they were given redundancy payments and told to find other jobs, suggesting the move was permanent and raising questions about the future of the plant. Some of the skilled former workers have had little trouble finding another job. Others have struggled. 'I'm just rushing to find a job in order to support my family,' said a former Rembrandt employee with several years at the company. Those struggling include undocumented workers who, Garcia said, were hired indirectly through third-party contractors. In February, the Storm Lake Times reported that a lawsuit by the family of a Guatemalan migrant worker who was crushed to death when cages collapsed on him revealed that he had been working under a false name through a subcontractor. Garcia also contrasted the seriousness with which Rembrandt took bird flu to the company's handling of Covid-19 as it surged in Iowa, particularly among labourers working close together on factory farms and in slaughterhouses. He said Rembrandt appeared to care more about avian flu outbreaks than Covid. He criticised the management for failing to require workers to wear a mask or to be vaccinated. 'They actually liked the fact that we didn't require our employees to get vaccinated, because they were hoping we would get employees from the surrounding areas that were requiring their employees to get vaccinated. They're using it almost as a recruitment tool,' he said. Other workers said that when they contracted Covid, they were obliged to use the days off they had earned as holidays instead of being given sick days. 'It's a company that makes millions of dollars. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that it doesn't care about people,' said Garcia.

{"id": "155", "fulltext": "Infection comes amid worst outbreak of the virus in seven years but CDC says health risk to general public remains low An inmate in Colorado has become the first human in the US to test positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, amid the worst outbreak of the virus in seven years and a cull of millions of poultry in dozens of states. The unnamed prisoner contracted the infection during a work release assignment at a farm in Montrose county where workers were euthanising an infected flock, the Colorado department of public health and environment said. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the health risk to the general public remained low. The patient reported fatigue for a few days as their only symptom and has since recovered, the agency said, adding that the man, who was younger than 40, was treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir. The Colorado case does not change the human health risk assessment the CDC said. The agency has tracked the health of more than 2,500 people with exposures to H5N1 virus-infected birds and this is the only case that has been found to date. Other people involved in the culling operation in Colorado have tested negative for H5 virus infection, but they are being retested out of an abundance of caution. The only other known human case of the strain of bird flu currently predominant was in the UK in December last year, the CDC noted, although almost 900 cases have been reported worldwide from earlier H5N1 viruses since 2003. The US agriculture department has been tracking the spread of avian influenza across 30 states and affecting more than 35 million birds, according to its latest figures. The Guardian reported on Thursday that more than 22 million birds have been killed in an attempt to contain the outbreak, the majority in Iowa, the biggest US producer of eggs. That figure didn’t include a commercial egg farm in Knox, Nebraska where 2.1 million poultry were reported affected on Wednesday. At one egg factory in Rembrandt, Iowa, about 250 employees were fired after roasting alive 5.3 million chickens, the largest cull at any factory farm in the country, in circumstances some fired workers and animal rights groups say were inhumane. The Storm Lake Times revealed that birds at Rembrandt were culled using a system known as ventilation shutdown plus (VSD+) in which air is closed off to the barns and heat pumped in until the temperature rises above 104F (40C). They cooked those birds alive, said one of the workers involved. Earlier in the week, an H3N8 strain of bird flu was detected in humans for the first time in Henan province in China. The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China’s National Health Commission. Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a highly contagious viral disease. The first reports of human cases came in the 1990s. Some strains have been passed to humans but it is currently very rare and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "An inmate in Colorado has become the first human in the US to test positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, amid the worst outbreak of the virus in seven years and a cull of millions of poultry in dozens of states."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 14}]}
{"id": "156", "fulltext": "LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Bird flu has been confirmed in a backyard poultry flock in south central Michigan's Branch County, the state Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said Saturday. Following an investigation by the agency, the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory detected the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a non-commercial flock, the agency said Saturday. The infected flock contained about 20 birds of various species, the agency said. The premises are under quarantine and the birds will be destroyed to limit spread of the disease. As wild birds continue to migrate and spread the virus, it is not unexpected to see more cases of HPAI being detected in domestic flocks across the state,\" State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland said in a news release. Bird flu can spread in various ways, including through wild birds, contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing of caretakers, the department said. State officials earlier reported cases of bird flu this year in Kalamazoo, Macomb, Livingston, Menominee, Saginaw and Washtenaw counties.

{"id": "157", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) Bird flu is killing an alarming number of bald eagles and other wild birds, with many sick birds arriving at rehabilitation centers unsteady on their talons and unable to fly. It's quite a sight to see an eagle with a six-foot wingspan having uncontrollable seizures because of highly pathogenic avian influenza, said Victoria Hall, executive director of the University of Minnesota's Raptor Center. At that point, they're so far into the disease there's no treatment options left. The latest outbreak of the highly contagious virus has led to the culling of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in U.S. farms since February, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed 956 cases of bird flu in wild birds, including at least 54 bald eagles. But the actual number is likely significantly higher because not every wild bird that dies is tested and the federal tally doesn't include cases recorded by wildlife rehabilitation centers. The latest reported toll is nearly 10 times higher than the 99 confirmed cases in wild birds during the last bird flu outbreak in 2015. This time, the virus has been detected in birds in 34 states, indicating it is far more widespread than seven years ago. The U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center also collects data from wildlife officials on suspected and confirmed bird flu deaths. It lists 8,536 recent wild bird deaths from avian influenza. This is definitely an unprecedented event, said researcher Rebecca Poulson, who has been studying avian influenza for 15 years at the University of Georgia's Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study. The number of birds and species and states already in which it has been detected is pretty alarming. Water fowl including ducks and geese, which typically carry the virus, and the raptors and scavengers that feed on them are the most commonly sickened birds, but cases have been confirmed in more than three dozen species. Ducks and geese are usually able to live with the virus without getting sick, but latest variant is proving more contagious and more deadly. We are seeing a tremendous impact from this virus, said Hall, whose Raptor Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, treats roughly 1,000 birds a year. We are seeing birds coming in suffering from this virus every single day. Nearly 61% of the 188 birds the rehabilitation center has tested since late March have had bird flu and all but one of those died. Hall said the center had to set up an area where workers wearing protective gear test sick and injured birds for avian influenza and quarantine them before bringing them into the center, to avoid infecting other birds. None of the 114 positive cases the center has recorded, including 28 bald eagles, are included in the USDA count, Hall said. She said a great horned owl recovered from the virus, giving her hope that some wild birds may be able to fight it off. USDA officials haven't responded to questions about why they are excluding the data from rehabilitation centers. Scientists estimated in a study published three years ago that the number of wild birds in North America had fallen by nearly 3 billion since 1970 as humans continue to encroach on their habitat. But it's too soon to know what impact the bird flu will have on bird populations because the outbreak is ongoing and there hasn't been enough time to study it, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service veterinarian Samantha Gibbs, and other experts. We're quite concerned. I think that we're going to be watching very carefully what the mortality rates are throughout the spring and summer, Gibbs said. Gibbs and Poulson said they fear the virus could survive the summer, when it usually dies off, leading to fall infections when migratory birds return south. That happened in Europe, where the virus is circulating first. Bald eagles, the U.S. national symbol since the 1700s, are among America's most celebrated conservation success stories. With an estimated 300,000 bald eagles in the country today, a population that quadrupled between 2009 and 2021, the bird was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species List in 2007. Given that, experts believe the species should weather the impact of this virus. State and federal officials will track the success of nesting eagles this spring and summer to gauge the impact of the virus. In Georgia, where three bald eagles that died tested positive for bird flu, the state Department of Natural Resources has documented a sharp drop in bald eagle reproduction this year in six coastal counties where many migratory birds spend the winter. Fewer than half of the 73 nests found there produced offspring, while nests elsewhere in the state had a success rate close to the average of 78% recorded in recent years. Some experts, including Hall, suggest that residential bird feeders should be removed to avoid further spread of the virus, but the USDA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service haven't recommended that because bird flu isn't common among the songbirds that frequent backyards. Still, they say it's important to regularly clean bird feeders to help limit the spread of other diseases. Wild birds could use all the help they can get right now, Hall said. When the virus is found on poultry farms, officials slaughter entire flocks to curb the spread, even when most birds have no symptoms. So far, 37.36 million birds have been killed in 32 states. USDA officials stress that bird flu doesn't jeopardize food safety because infected birds aren't allowed to enter the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses or bacteria. Health officials also say bird flu doesn't represent a significant health risk to people, even though one human case of the disease was confirmed in Colorado last month. Officials say people are unlikely to catch the virus unless they have prolonged direct exposure to infected birds. ___ Associated Press writers Carrie Antlfinger in Milwaukee and Doug Glass in Minneapolis contributed to this story.

{"id": "158", "fulltext": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — An avian flu that's spreading quickly across the U.S. has been detected in the Pacific Northwest in two backyard bird flocks in rural Oregon and Washington. Several geese in a noncommercial flock of about 100 waterfowl died suddenly on a farm in Linn County, Oregon, and federal authorities confirmed Friday that they died of the avian flu. It was the state's first case since 2015. Also Friday, authorities in Washington state received word that chickens and turkeys in a flock of about 50 birds at a noncommercial farm in Pacific County, Washington, also had the disease. All the birds in both states were euthanized Friday and the farms were put under quarantine. The latest outbreak of avian flu hit North America in December and has led to the culling of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in U.S. farms since February. More than 35 million birds in flocks across 30 states have been affected. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed 956 cases of bird flu in wild birds, including at least 54 bald eagles. But the actual number is likely significantly higher because not every wild bird that dies is tested and the federal tally doesn’t include cases recorded by wildlife rehabilitation centers. The discovery of the avian flu in the Pacific Northwest wasn’t unexpected as the virus has been spreading rapidly across the country in both domestic and wild birds, particularly waterfowl. The virus seems to be spreading as wild birds migrate north along the Pacific Flyway and sometimes those birds stop to rest amidst domestic flocks, said Dana Dobbs, a veterinarian with Washington state. An infected bald eagle was found in British Columbia, Canada, in early March, said Dr. Ryan Scholz, Oregon's state veterinarian. “The long and the short of it is the producer noticed that one day a crow flew in with some of his chickens and the next day, he literally described that they were dropping like flies,” he said. “We want to contain and eradicate this disease as soon as possible to protect our commercial poultry industry as well as some of our backyard flocks that are selling eggs and doing things like that.” The cases do not pose a risk to humans, and birds from the farms were not used for food. Wildlife authorities in the Pacific Northwest said Friday that the virus seems to primarily affect waterfowl, but people who feed songbirds should take extra steps to clean their feeders frequently out of an abundance of caution. There are no detections of the avian flu in commercial poultry in either state, state agriculture officials said Friday.

{"id": "159", "fulltext": "CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Canadian poultry farmers are facing fear and stress as a highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 avian influenza is currently circulating in both wild and domestic flocks across North America. According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency poultry and egg producers in Canada have lost more than 1.7 million birds to avian influenza since late 2021. That tally includes both birds that have died of the virus and birds that have been euthanized. David Hyink, an Alberta chicken farmer, checks his barns each day with a sense of trepidation. He knows if the disease were to turn up on his property, it would mean the loss of his entire flock. Avian influenza has a high mortality rate, and those birds at outbreak sites that don’t die from the disease are humanely euthanized to prevent the spread of the virus. “While we haven’t had it on our farm, and I hope we don’t, it just appears it could be anybody,” Hyink said. “It could be us next, the farm next to us, you just don’t know.” Alberta is Canada’s hardest hit province with 900,000 birds dead and 23 farms affected. Ontario is the second hardest hit with 23 affected farms and 425,000 birds dead. Outbreaks of the virus have turned up now in every province except Prince Edward Island. Across the country, farmers are being encouraged to keep birds indoors, restrict visitors and ramp up biosecurity measures to help halt the spread. The virus can be spread between birds through direct contact, but it also spreads easily from wild bird droppings and can be carried into commercial flocks on the feet of workers or on equipment. While avian influenza was first detected in Canada in 2004, this year’s strain—which has also been wreaking havoc in Europe and Asia—is “unprecedented” in terms of its global impact, according to the CFIA. The new strain is highly transmissible and appears to be sustaining itself within wild bird populations. While there’s some hope that case counts might decline when the spring bird migration ends in June, for now, farmers are left wondering where and when the next outbreak will happen. “You just don’t know, and you do the best you can,” Hyink said. While farmers who lose flocks to avian influenza are eligible for government compensation, the disease has still caused significant disruption for industry, said Jean-Michel Laurin, chief executive of the Canadian Poultry and Egg Processors Council. Laurin said consumers have not been affected by any shortages, as the Canadian supply chain as a whole for eggs and poultry is holding up well. Part of the reason for that, he said, is that unlike in the U.S. — where massive industrial scale barns are much more common, meaning an outbreak at one property can take out an enormous amount of supply — Canadian chicken barns tend to be smaller, family run operations. Health officials say that while avian influenza can occasionally cause illness in humans, it is rare and would be the result of close contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 0}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 2}]}
{"id": "160", "fulltext": "Roughly 3.2 million confirmed cases of the bird flu have been found in chickens at six farms in Maryland and Delaware over the past two months, agriculture officials said Friday, part of a broader problem with the virus that is quietly sweeping across the country. Eighty black vultures in Maryland's Harford County also were recently found dead from the highly pathogenic avian influenza, officials said, near wildlife areas along the Susquehanna River. Maryland and Delaware agriculture authorities said they have had reports of chickens at the farms being infected with the bird flu since February. The vultures were found in the past two weeks. Thirty-seven million chickens and turkeys have been culled on U.S. farms since February because of the latest outbreak, according to the Agriculture Department, and roughly 950 cases of bird flu have been found in wild birds, including at least 54 bald eagles. In Virginia, officials said they detected bird flu in February among a 'backyard flock' of roughly 90 turkeys, chickens and ducks in Fauquier County. There has been no bird flu detected in D.C., officials said. 'The numbers are just staggering in terms of the poultry,' said Charlie Broaddus, the state veterinarian in Virginia. One of the biggest factors in the bird flu's spread this year, he said, is that it's being carried by wild ducks and geese that are infected but 'don't typically become affected' by it. 'They're carriers,' Broaddus said, 'but the genetic sequence has the potential to make domestic birds much, much sicker.' Broaddus said the larger farms that have hens producing eggs that 'end up in the supermarket' tend to be large-scale operations, where the flu can spread quickly. Sometimes, he said, chickens at farms become infected when a farmer or worker 'accidentally tracks through goose droppings near a pond' and then brings it into the chicken facility. 'It takes just one to be infected before they spread it to others,' Broaddus said. Many wild birds don't always show signs of the virus, but it can be easily transmitted between birds through their droppings or through respiratory secretions, experts said. Agricultural officials at the Delaware-Maryland HPAI Joint Information Center said they were concerned about the vultures, because they're scavengers and 'if they eat a bird infected with avian influenza, whether it's a migratory bird such as a Canadian goose, other waterfowl, or another vulture, they will ingest the virus and then can get sick and die.' 'We want to ensure they are taking steps to stop the spread of the virus so that they don't inadvertently transport it to other areas heavily populated with wild birds,' said Stacey Hofmann, a spokeswoman for the joint command center. Officials with the command centers in Maryland and Virginia said they have response teams to quickly 'take action' to try to stop the spread of the bird flu and are encouraging farmers to be 'proactive in ensuring vultures do not stop at their farms.' The high number of black vultures found in the wild in Harford County is particularly alarming to some experts, because it means the birds are spreading the virus as they're eating carcasses. 'That's a lot of vultures to get the bird flu at once,' said Dan Rauch, the wildlife biologist for the District. 'Vultures travel to where their food sources are, so they're moving all over the place. 'They feed together and roost together, so that allows this highly pathogenic disease to spread quickly,' he said. The birds then 'shed the virus through their saliva, mucus and feces.' 'It gets into the community and sticks around,' Rauch said. 'It's not good.' Agriculture experts at the joint command center in Maryland and Delaware advised the public to 'help limit the spread of the disease by not moving bird droppings via their shoes to other wild-bird habitats.' People should also change their shoes and clean off dirty shoes after they've visited a wild or natural area. Experts said 'spraying the bottoms of your shoes with a common household cleaner such as Lysol or a dilute bleach spray will kill the avian influenza virus,' a command center statement said. For those with pet birds or poultry at home, officials recommend you 'wash your hands, change clothes, and clean your shoes after visiting areas where wild birds frequent.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 7}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "'Vultures travel to where their food sources are, so they're moving all over the place.

{"id": "161", "fulltext": "SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Agriculture experts have confirmed Washington state's second outbreak of bird flu, this time in a non-commercial flock in Spokane County. The affected flock is a mix of about 75 geese, chickens, ducks and guinea fowl and they were euthanized. A private veterinarian submitted a dead goose that exhibited unusual behavior prior to death, including walking abnormally, shaking its head, not moving, and exhibiting a lack of fear of humans. The presence of H5N1 avian influenza virus in the flock was detected by Washington State University's Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory on Saturday. This is the second detection of the virus in Washington state this year, following last week's confirmation in Pacific County, also in a backyard flock. There are no detections in commercial poultry in the state. Officials said there is no immediate public health concern due to the avian influenza virus detected. Avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat. Avian influenza can be transmitted from wild birds to domestic birds through direct contact, fecal contamination, transmission through the air, environmental contamination, and shared water sources.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 0}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 4}]}
{"id": "162", "fulltext": "Welcome to our monthly roundup of the biggest issues in farming and food production, with must-read reports from around the web News from around the world Millions of birds have been culled in the US after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza or 'bird flu.' The outbreaks have led zoos to temporarily close aviary exhibits and move birds away from the public. As we have reported, vets and animal advocates have called for restrictions on 'cruel' methods of culling birds using extreme heat and steam. A giant leap in global food prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has helped three members of the super-rich Cargill family, who majority-own one of the world's largest food companies, join the ranks of the world's 500 richest people. Scientists have uncovered evidence that dangerous versions of superbugs can spread from pigs to humans. The discovery, made in Denmark, underlines fears that intensive use of antibiotics on farms is leading to the spread of microbes resistant to them. The Clostridioides difficile superbug infects the human gut and is resistant to all but three antibiotics in use today. An increase in the use of feedlots as opposed to grass-fed production in Brazilian beef production is being driven by China, according to reports. China buys about 50% of Brazil's exported beef. Meanwhile, Uruguay's beef production could hit record levels this year. A merino sheep named Shrekapo who grew an enormous fleece while evading capture in New Zealand is now 18.6kg lighter after its first shave. Shrekapo was spotted hiding in the rocks, and was caught later that day, carrying nearly half its bodyweight in wool. The animal had probably been roaming the hills alone for the past three winters. UK news The UK's free-range egg sector is on the brink of collapse because of sharply rising costs, the British Free Range Egg Producers Association has warned. In a recent poll, more than 70% of members said they would quit if price rises were not forthcoming. Meanwhile, an estimated 10% of the UK's pig breeding herd has gone, as the National Pig Association (NPA) warned of significant gaps between the costs and pig prices. British food producers warned that perishable goods were losing their value due to congestion around the port of Dover caused by disruption to ferry services and customs operations. Fresh meat has reportedly been stranded for one to two days and possibly longer due to the current problems. One of the UK's biggest food retailers has warned chicken could soon cost as much as beef as production costs soar. Steve Murrells, chief executive of the Co-op, said that feed costs had become a huge challenge for the poultry industry. Welfare campaigners now fear the cost of living crisis could stall the campaign to phase out the faster-growing broiler breeds associated with higher mortality, lameness and muscle disease than slower-growing breeds. A vet whistleblower has been awarded a £1.25m payout after losing her job at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) when she raised concerns over meat traceability in Northern Ireland. She had also highlighted serious breaches of animal welfare legislation within the meat supply chain, the Belfast Telegraph reported. The number of documented violations of legislation designed to reduce water pollution caused by agriculture in England has hit record levels as the rules remain largely unenforced. Last year had the highest number of recorded violations of the farming rules for water since the legislation was introduced in April 2018. From the Animals Farmed series An H3N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, in China's central province of Henan. The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China's National Health Commission. Northern Ireland will need to lose more than 1 million sheep and cattle to meet its new legally binding climate emissions targets. The large-scale reduction in farm animals comes after the passing of the jurisdiction's first ever climate act, requiring the farming sector to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Organic dairy, for so long the sector's success story, is facing a crisis of confidence, with fears about whether people will keep buying organic milk, butter and cheese as food prices soar. Some UK organic farmers are being paid a milk price that is lower than the price some of their non-organic competitors get. A loophole in government regulations meant that chickens could still be called free-range even though they were no longer allowed outside because of repeated outbreaks of bird flu across the UK. The ban on birds being allowed outdoors was lifted at the beginning of May. And in the US, Charlie Hope-D'nieri and photographer Danny Wilcox Frazier have reported on how factory pig farms are hollowing out rural communities in the state of Iowa. The state is responsible for producing almost one-third of US hogs. Share your stories and feedback Thank you to everyone who continues to get in touch to share their thoughts on the series. Irmtraud Chladek wrote: While reading the article Northern Ireland faces loss of 1 million sheep and cattle to meet climate targets, I wondered about the reasons for such an emphasis on livestock in Northern Ireland. Is the only way to combat the methane emissions to cut the numbers of livestock? Are there no larger areas of peat bogs and marshes, which could be renatured in order to become CO2 troughs or sinks, therefore keeping CO2 underground. Another practice to sink CO2 is agroforestry, would that be a feasible way in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when going back to gain arable land?

{"id": "163", "fulltext": "Consumers flipped over the notion of hamburgers made from plants instead of animals when the alternatives showed up in supermarkets and fast-food chains about five years ago. But with prices for meat replacements high and America's taste for real beef intact, shoppers steered away even as the plant-based meat-alternative industry slogged away with new products, better distribution and the opening of new international markets. Now, plant-based product makers could be poised to get their sizzle back. Inflation is raising prices of beef and other meats faster than for plant-based alternatives. Plus, price hikes related to an avian flu outbreak that has spread to flocks in 34 states could tempt more consumers to try the newfangled meat and poultry replacements. If those inducements aren't enough, there are the more traditional selling points: The new protein alternatives are more ecological because growing plants isn't as rough on the environment as raising farm animals. The substitutes are healthier since plant-based foods lack artery-clogging cholesterol. 'If we can get more people to incorporate plant-based meat into their diet, it's a win for them, it's a win for us, it's a win for the planet,' said Peter McGuinness, CEO of Impossible Foods, a leading maker of plant-based meats. The timing could be right. In April, fresh beef and chicken prices had both risen more than 9% over the previous year. By contrast, meat alternatives were down 1.6%, 210 Analytics reported. But showing just how far they will need to go, the alternatives averaged $8.15 a pound, almost twice the average price of ground beef. The problem: Market penetration lags Still, there's hope. At a Ralphs, a Kroger supermarket brand in Southern California, a four-pack of Impossible's plant-based bratwurst was selling on promotion for $5.99 this week instead of the usual $8.99. A 12-pack of Johnsonville pork brats, however, was priced at $8.99, discounted from the normal $12.99. Inflation is having an outsize impact on meat prices, 'further narrowing that price gap to plant-based foods,' said Rachel Dreskin, CEO of the Plant Based Foods Association and Institute. 'Plant-based is no longer a niche. This is a full-fledged industry, and the moment for plant-based is now.' The nationwide bird flu outbreak could continue to increase poultry prices, tempting shoppers even further. Farmers have had to kill more than 25 million chickens, turkeys and other livestock fowl to try to head off an avian flu outbreak so vicious that it is felling bald eagles in the wild. Prices for poultry items are estimated to increase by at least 6% this year, according to the USDA's food price outlook. The market holds nothing but upside for plant-based meat manufacturers. Their products make up just 1.5% of meat sales, and only about 1 in 5 consumers purchase plant-based meat at retail, reports Caroline Bushnell, a vice president for the Good Food Institute, nonprofit advancing alternative proteins. By contrast, the plant-based milk industry has reached 42% of households and has a 16% share of the liquid milk category. Besides the price differential, Bushnell said potential consumers were put off by the fear they wouldn't like the taste of meat substitutes. But that's exactly where the new high-tech makers of plant-based meats think they can score if only consumers will give them a try. Impossible and its archrival, Beyond Meat, have introduced sausages, meatballs and chicken nuggets or tenders that they believe have, because of technology, the texture, fatty taste and sizzle of real meats. Beyond has even tried jerky. Beyond Meat, however, has been flame-broiling its investors. Its stock sank more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday after it missed sales estimates for the first three months of the year. It had a net loss of $100.5 million over the quarter. Impossible is privately held. McGuinness, who took over recently as CEO after leaving yogurt maker Chobani, said in an interview that his goal was to quadruple the number of locations selling Impossible's products to 100,000. The solution: Innovate and cut costs To do it, he said he's going to direct marketing at 'the masses,' not just high-end consumers who aren't as resistant to paying more for a plant-based product. And McGuinness said the messaging will go much further. 'The value proposition isn't just price and price alone,' he said. 'Our products are better for you health-wise and they're tasting as good or better than animal products.' Both Impossible and Beyond tout having made past price cuts. McGuinness said the major impediment to lowering prices further is scale. Higher sales and more production could help achieve economies of scale that cut prices further. Since he plans to grow the brand, McGuinness believes prices will fall further. The growth will be helped by the introduction of still more innovative products. Bushnell said a rush of innovators are entering the industry, besides the ones already working to bring new products to market. Some are working on lab-based products like one that would produce animal-like fat without the animals. Another vows to make a plant-based steak akin to filet mignon. For the moment, there seem to be myriad ways to take the moo out of the chew.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 6}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 0}]}
{"id": "164", "fulltext": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A baby fox has tested positive for the bird flu in Minnesota, the first confirmed case in a wild mammal in the state, according to the Department of Natural Resources. The kit found in Anoka County died, as did two red fox kits in Ontario, Canada who tested positive for the avian flu last week, the first reported cases in a wild mammal in North America, according to the DNR. The University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory alerted the DNR, which monitors the health of the state's wildlife. The National Veterinary Services Laboratory later confirmed the positive test earlier this week, state officials said. The DNR routinely responds to reports of sick wildlife and conducts testing for many wildlife diseases. It will now add avian influenza to the routine screening process when foxes with neurological symptoms are submitted to the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

The kits in Lapeer, Macomb and St. Clair counties were confirmed Wednesday to have died from the HPAI virus, Michigan's Department of Natural Resources said Thursday. They are the first confirmation by the state of the virus in wild mammals. The fox kits were collected from dens between April 1-14. The viruses may occasionally transmit from birds to mammals, as occurred in these cases, and there may be additional detections in other mammals during this outbreak, but they likely will be isolated cases,\" said Megan Moriarty, Michigan DNR wildlife veterinarian. \"At this point, it is unclear how the fox kits became infected, but it's possible that they were exposed by consuming infected birds, such as waterfowl.\" A baby fox in Minnesota also recently tested positive for the bird flu. It died, as did two red fox kits in Ontario, Canada, who tested positive for the avian flu last week. Avian influenza is highly pathogenic and affects birds throughout North America. It has been detected in backyard flocks and commercial poultry facilities, and in wild birds in more than 30 states, according to the DNR. Farms have euthanized millions of birds. On Tuesday, Michigan officials announced a temporary ban on all poultry and waterfowl exhibitions amid the avian flu outbreak.

{"id": "166", "fulltext": "OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) Additional cases of bird flu have been confirmed with the most recent in Whatcom and Okanogan counties, Washington state agricultural officials said Friday. The cases were confirmed Thursday in non-commercial backyard flocks, the state Department of Agriculture said in a statement. Flock owners contacted the state's sick bird hotline to report an unusual number of sudden deaths and sickness in their flocks. The flocks, one with around 100 chickens and the other with nearly 30 chicken, ducks, and geese, are quarantined and will be euthanized, the statement said. Cases of avian flu were also confirmed in backyard flocks in Spokane County earlier this week and last week in Pacific County. Agriculture Department spokesperson Amber Betts said other cases also have been confirmed in Pierce and Clallam counties. The latest outbreak of avian flu hit North America in December and has led to the culling of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in U.S. farms since February. More than 35 million birds in flocks across 30 states have been affected. State officials say reducing or eliminating contact between wild birds and domestic flocks is a key way to protect domestic birds from bird flu. Bird owners should bring their flocks inside or undercover to protect them from wild waterfowl, officials said. If flock owners could remain diligent for just a few weeks until the waterfowl complete their migration north, we are hopeful we can get through the worst of it with lower impact, Dr. Amber Itle, Washington state veterinarian, said.

{"id": "167", "fulltext": "Brad Moline, a fourth-generation Iowa turkey farmer, saw this happen before. In 2015, a virulent avian flu outbreak nearly wiped out his flock. Barns once filled with chattering birds were suddenly silent. Employees were anguished by having to kill sickened animals. The family business, started in 1924, was at serious risk. His business recovered, but now the virus is back, again imperiling the nation's poultry farms. And this time, there's another pernicious force at work: a potent wave of misinformation that claims the bird flu isn't real. 'You just want to beat your head against the wall,' Moline said of the Facebook groups in which people insist the flu is fake or, maybe, a bioweapon. 'I understand the frustration with how COVID was handled. I understand the lack of trust in the media today. I get it. But this is real.' While it poses little risk to humans, the global outbreak has led farmers to cull millions of birds and threatens to add to already rising food prices. It's also spawning fantastical claims similar to the ones that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring how conspiracy theories often emerge at times of uncertainty, and how the internet and a deepening distrust of science and institutions fuel their spread. The claims can be found on obscure online message boards and major platforms like Twitter. Some versions claim the flu is fake, a hoax being used to justify reducing the supply of birds in an effort to drive up food prices, either to wreck the global economy or force people into vegetarianism. 'There is no bird flu outbreak,' wrote one man on Reddit. 'It's just Covid for chickens.' Other posters insist the flu is real, but that it was genetically engineered as a weapon, possibly intended to touch off a new round of COVID-style lockdowns. A version of the story popular in India posits that 5G cell towers are somehow to blame for the virus. As evidence, many of those claiming that the flu is fake note that animal health authorities monitoring the outbreak are using some of the same technology used to test for COVID-19. 'They're testing the animals for bird flu with PCR tests. That should give you a clue as to what's going on,' wrote one Twitter user, in a post that's been liked and retweeted thousands of times. In truth, PCR tests have been used routinely in medicine, biology and even law enforcement for decades; their creator won a Nobel Prize in 1993. The reality of the outbreak is far more mundane, if no less devastating to birds and people who depend on them for their livelihood. Farmers in states like Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota have already culled millions of fowl to prevent the outbreak from spreading. Zoos around the U.S. have moved exotic bird exhibits indoors to protect their animals, and wildlife authorities are discouraging backyard bird feeding in some states to prevent the spread by wild birds. The disease has also claimed bald eagles around the country. The first known human case of the H5N1 outbreak in the U.S. was confirmed last month in Colorado in a prison inmate who had been assisting with culling and disposing of poultry at a local farm. Most human cases involve direct contact with infected birds, meaning the risk to a broad population is low, but experts around the country are monitoring the virus closely just to be sure, according to Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, an agency that tracks animal disease in part to protect the state's agricultural industries. 'I can guarantee you, this is the real deal,' Poulsen told The Associated Press. 'We certainly aren't making this up.' Poultry farms drive the local economy in some parts of Wisconsin, Poulsen said, adding that a devastating outbreak of avian flu could create real hardships for farmers as well as consumers. While the details may vary, the conspiracy theories about avian flu all speak to a distrust of authority and institutions, and a suspicion that millions of doctors, scientists, veterinarians, journalists and elected officials around the world can no longer be trusted. 'Americans clearly understand that the federal government and major media have lied to them repeatedly, and are completely corrupted by the pharmaceutical companies,' said Dr. Joseph Mercola, an osteopath whose discredited claims about vaccines, masks and the coronavirus made him a prominent source of COVID-19 misinformation. Mercola's interest in the bird flu dates back years. A 2006 book for sale on his website, which Mercola uses to sell unproven natural health remedies, is titled 'The Great Bird Flu Hoax.' Polls show trust in many American institutions, including the news media, has fallen in recent years. Trust in science and scientific experts is also down, and along partisan lines. Moline, the Iowa turkey farmer, said he sympathizes with people who question what they read about viruses, given the last two years and bitter debates about masks, vaccines and lockdowns. But he said anyone who doubts the existence or seriousness of the avian flu doesn't understand the threat. The 2015 outbreak was later determined to be the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. Moline's farm had to cull tens of thousands of turkeys after the flu got into one of his barns. Workers at the farm now abide by a hygiene policy meant to limit the spread of viruses, including using different pairs of boots and clothes for different barns. Conspiracy theories are bound to flourish during times of social unrest or unease, according to John Jackson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. Before the internet, there were likely just as many people who privately doubted explanations for big events, Jackson said. But they enjoyed limited opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals, few chances to win new converts, and no way to broadcast their views to strangers. Now, the conspiracy theories that gain wide popularity, such as the QAnon movement or discredited claims about COVID-19, work because they give believers a sense of control in a rapidly changing, interconnected world, Jackson said. While they can emerge after disasters, assassinations or plane crashes, they can also appear during times of social upheaval or rapid change. 'There isn't a phenomena on the planet, whether it's the avian flu or 5G, that isn't already primed for conspiracists,' Jackson said. 'Now we have coronavirus, which has traumatized us so profoundly... we look at this same idea of bird flu with completely new eyes, and we bring different kinds of conspiracy to it.' Claims that the avian flu is a hoax used to drive up food prices also highlight real-world concerns about inflation and food shortages. Worries that the flu is somehow linked to 5G towers underscore anxieties about technological change. Suggestions that it will be used to mandate vegetarianism, on the other hand, reflect uncertainties about sustainable agriculture, climate change and animal welfare. By creating explanations, conspiracy theories can offer the believer a sense of power or control, Jackson said. But he said they also defy common sense in their cinematic fantasies about vast, sprawling conspiracies of millions working with clockwork efficiency to undermine human affairs. 'Conspiracy theories rest on the idea that humans have the capacity for keeping secrets,' Jackson said. 'But they underestimate the reality that we aren't very good at keeping them.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 12}, {"key": "affirm_keyword_statement_2", "statement": "'There is no bird flu outbreak,' wrote one man on Reddit.

{"id": "168", "fulltext": "SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — With bird flu hitting nine flocks scattered across seven counties, the Washington state Department of Agriculture on Thursday requested that live market poultry sales cease for the next 30 days. The closure is not mandatory. Confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 have shown up in nine small backyard flocks in Thurston, Pierce, Pacific, Clallam, Spokane, Whatcom and Okanogan counties since May 5, the agency said. Dr. Amber Itle, the Washington state veterinarian, said bird flu has been reported in 35 states this year. “We are one of the last states to get hit,” she said during a news conference. All nine infected locations consisted of backyard flocks with substantial exposure to wild waterfowl. No commercial flocks have been infected. Commercial poultry products remain safe to consume, the agency said. Itle said the bird flu does not appear to have human health risks at this time, and is unlikely to impact dogs, cats or other pets. But she cautioned pet owners to keep their animals away from dead birds. Markets that choose to continue bird sales risk disease transmission, state officials said. If a case of HPAI were detected in connection with a market, there would be significant impacts. The market would face thorough animal tracing and extensive cleaning and disinfection requirements, officials said. WSDA has reached out to all markets that have live sales of birds and advised them to stop sales. Some markets had already voluntarily stopped selling birds even before receiving the advice from the state veterinarian. “Temporarily suspending poultry and waterfowl sales is recommended until detections across Washington slow down. This may extend until the end of June,” Itle said. For markets that choose to remain open, Itle made several recommendations to reduce the risk of transmitting disease, including increasing biosecurity measures, only selling birds destined for slaughter, prohibiting birds with signs of illness, keeping birds in transport containers and not comingling. So far, the infected flocks have been relatively small, backyard flocks. “Stopping these sales protects not only these backyard flocks but small and large commercial flocks as well,” Itle said. “It is all about reducing risk. Bringing birds from different flocks together definitely increases opportunities for this virus to spread and impact more birds.”", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 3}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_3", "statement": "Bringing birds from different flocks together definitely increases opportunities for this virus to spread and impact more birds."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 4}]}
{"id": "169", "fulltext": "Mass infections in wild birds pose a significant risk to vulnerable species, are hard to contain and increase the opportunity for the virus to spill over into people. A highly infectious and deadly strain of avian influenza virus has infected tens of millions of poultry birds across Europe, Asia, Africa and North America. But scientists are particularly concerned about the unprecedented spread in wild birds. Outbreaks pose a significant risk to vulnerable species, are hard to contain and increase the opportunity for the virus to spill over into people. Since October, the H5N1 strain has caused nearly 3,000 outbreaks in poultry in dozens of countries. More than 77 million birds have been culled to curb the spread of the virus, which almost always causes severe disease or death in chickens. Another 400,000 non-poultry birds, such as wild birds, have also died in 2,600 outbreaks, twice the number reported during the last major wave, in 2016-17. Researchers say that the virus seems to be spreading in wild birds more easily than ever before, making outbreaks particularly hard to contain. Wild birds help to transport the virus around the world, with their migration patterns determining when and where it will spread next. Regions in Asia and Europe will probably continue to see large outbreaks, and infections could creep into currently unaffected continents such as South America and Australia. Although people can catch the virus, infections are uncommon. Only two cases have been reported since October, one each in the United Kingdom and the United States. But scientists are concerned that the high levels of virus circulating in bird populations mean that there are more opportunities for spillover into people. Avian influenza viruses change slowly over time, but the right mutation could make them more transmissible in people and other species, says Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organization (WHO)-collaborating influenza centre at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia. \"These viruses are like ticking time bombs,\" he says. \"Occasional infections are not an issue but the gradual gaining of function of these viruses is what is the real concern,\" he says. Virus origin The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain emerged in commercial geese in Asia in around 1996, and spread in poultry throughout Europe and Africa in the early 2000s. By 2005, the strain was causing mass deaths in wild birds, first in East Asia and then in Europe. Since then, the strain has repeatedly infected wild birds in many parts of the world, says Andy Ramey, a research wildlife geneticist at the US Geological Survey Alaska Science Center in Anchorage. Through repeated spillovers, Ramey says, H5N1 seems to have become more adapted to wild birds. It's now become an emerging wildlife disease, he says. In 2014, a new highly pathogenic H5 lineage called 2.3.4.4 emerged and started infecting wild birds without always killing them. This created opportunities for the virus to spread to North America for the first time. The lineage has since dominated outbreaks around the world, including the current ones. The virus affects some wild bird species more severely than others. For instance, some infected mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) show no signs of disease, whereas the virus killed roughly 10% of the breeding population of barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard late last year and hundreds of Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus) in Greece earlier this year. Wildlife researchers are trying to understand why the virus affects species differently. They are particularly concerned about the virus's impact on vulnerable bird species with smaller populations or restricted geographic ranges, and species that are particularly susceptible to infection, such as whooping cranes (Grus americana) and emperor geese (Anser canagicus), Ramey says. Ramey adds that only a fraction of cases in wild birds are diagnosed and reported. More monitoring could unveil the true magnitude of wild bird mortality, he says. Controlling the spread Better monitoring of infected wild birds could also help to alert poultry facilities to the risk of future outbreaks. Although regions with large poultry or migratory bird populations are at high risk of further outbreaks no matter how good their surveillance is, says Keith Hamilton, head of the department for preparedness and resilience at the World Organisation for Animal Health. Tracking disease in wild birds is resource-intensive and challenging owing to the sheer size of their populations, Hamilton says. He suggests targeted surveillance in areas more likely to encounter the virus, such as popular flyways or breeding grounds. An effective vaccine for poultry could help to stem the spread, along with decreases in the number of birds in production facilities, says Michelle Wille, a wild-bird virologist at the University of Sydney in Australia. The poultry industry can also continue to improve biosecurity by restricting entry to facilities, protecting their water sources and decreasing contact between poultry and wild birds. Although poultry populations can be culled to stop the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, researchers emphasize that wild birds should not be harmed to mitigate outbreaks. Killing wild birds to prevent further infections would not work because of the huge size and vast ranges of their populations, says Lina Awada, a veterinary epidemiologist at the World Organisation for Animal Health. It could even make the situation worse, because it would disrupt wild-bird movements and behaviours, helping the virus spread further, she says. \"The same way we shouldn't be shooting bats because of coronavirus, the solution to this is not trying to kill wild birds,\" Wille says. Researchers say that what is needed is a holistic approach that considers how avian influenza spreads through wild birds, poultry and people. Collaboration between public-health researchers and animal-health groups is vital for picking up spillover events into people. \"If we control this in poultry, we control this in humans, and it's likely that we control this in wild birds, as well,\" Wille says.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 16}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_5", "statement": "\"These viruses are like ticking time bombs,\" he says. \"Occasional infections are not an issue but the gradual gaining of function of these viruses is what is the real concern,\" he says."}, {"key": "affirm_evolve_statement_3", "statement": "\"These viruses are like ticking time bombs,\" he says. \"Occasional infections are not an issue but the gradual gaining of function of these viruses is what is the real concern,\" he says."}, {"key": "affirm_humanspread_statement_3", "statement": "\"These viruses are like ticking time bombs,\" he says. \"Occasional infections are not an issue but the gradual gaining of function of these viruses is what is the real concern,\" he says."}, {"key": "affirm_pandemic_statement_4", "statement": "\"These viruses are like ticking time bombs,\" he says. \"Occasional infections are not an issue but the gradual gaining of function of these viruses is what is the real concern,\" he says."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 9}, {"key": "deny_keyword_statement_1", "statement": "The same way we shouldn't be shooting bats because of coronavirus, the solution to this is not trying to kill wild birds,"}]}
{"id": "170", "fulltext": "One ecologist counted 160 dead wild birds while walking round a Scottish loch, and figures from other countries are just as worrying. As he walked along the shoreline of a Highland loch on a fine May evening, ecologist and wildlife photographer Peter Stronach could hardly believe what he was seeing. The beach was littered with dead and dying birds: male eider ducks, several species of gulls, a gannet, a puffin and no fewer than 26 pink-footed geese, which should by now have been on the way back to their Icelandic breeding grounds. In all, Stronach recorded 72 individual birds of 17 species at Loch Fleet national nature reserve on the east coast of Scotland on that one day, plus many more in the following days. But these birds had not been killed by a passing predator; nor were they the hapless victims of a sudden storm at sea. The cause of these deaths was a highly infectious—and for birds, usually lethal—virus. Avian influenza H5N1 or, as it is more commonly known, bird flu, is back with a vengeance. What really worries Stronach is the range of species he found. Earlier this spring, we noticed that avian flu was restricted to the geese; but since then it has spread to other wildfowl, raptors and seabirds. In previous years, it mainly occurred in winter; now, he says, it is affecting the breeding populations of iconic coastal species such as the eider. Elsewhere in Scotland earlier this month about 20 great skuas were found dead or dying on Fair Isle, with more reported from other breeding colonies on the Shetland Isles. This followed a serious outbreak of bird flu in 2021, when hundreds of skuas died. For any species, these deaths are a serious setback, especially at the height of the breeding season. But for great skuas and pink-footed geese, this news is especially troubling. Scotland hosts 60% of the global breeding population of great skuas, and 90% of the world population of pink-footed geese overwinter in the UK. For these two species, both of which are on the amber list of birds of conservation concern, bird flu could pose a serious threat to their long-term future. Bird flu is by no means confined to the UK. In December 2021, an outbreak in the Hula valley, in northern Israel, killed more than 5,000 cranes out of a wintering population of 30,000 birds. In what the Israeli government called 'the deadliest wildlife disaster in the nation's history' workers wearing hazmat suits were photographed collecting the corpses. After the outbreak, farmers were instructed to slaughter hundreds of thousands of chickens. In Canada, a deadly strain of bird flu has already ravaged the poultry industry, resulting in almost 2 million chickens being killed. Now it has transferred not only to wild birds but mammals too. While the disease is usually confined to waterbirds, this particular strain has attacked crows, jays, gulls, raptors and even young foxes. The US is suffering what looks to become the worst ever outbreak of bird flu—which farmers are blaming on transmission from wild birds. More than 37 million chickens and turkeys have so far been culled, with more to come. If just one bird tests positive, the farmers must destroy the entire flock. As one report noted: 'In Wisconsin, lines of dump trucks have taken days to collect masses of bird carcasses and pile them in unused fields. Neighbours live with the stench of the decaying birds.' Even the bald eagle, America's national bird, has been affected. Could it also affect humans? The answer is, in very rare cases, yes—usually those, such as farmworkers, who have been in close and prolonged contact with infected domesticated birds. From 2003 to 2021, almost 500 people around the world died after catching the virus. Clearly, bird flu is something we need to take seriously. But Stronach is concerned that the current monitoring and surveillance system is designed to protect commercial poultry firms, and is not really adequate for wild bird populations. 'We need urgent research to find out what other species it is found in, and, crucially, the mechanisms by which it is spreading,' he says. He is especially concerned that if dead birds are not collected after an outbreak, they may be scavenged by buzzards, red kites, gulls and skuas, thus spreading the disease even faster. Anyone who finds a dead or dying wild bird, which they suspect might have the disease, should not touch the corpse; nor should they attempt to rescue it if it is still alive. In the UK, they should immediately report their findings to Defra's helpline 03459 335577.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 9}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "The cause of these deaths was a highly infectious—and for birds, usually lethal—virus.

{"id": "171", "fulltext": "The rapidly spreading avian influenza outbreak in the U.S. that has led to the death of nearly 40 million birds is squeezing Hormel Foods Corp.'s turkey flocks, as meat prices hit their highest levels in years. The Austin, Minn.-based maker of Spam said its Jennie-O turkey brand faces an uncertain period as the bird flu outbreak is expected to continue to weigh on industrywide poultry supplies. Jennie-O Turkey Store sales volumes are expected to decline about 30% in the second half of the year due to supply gaps, Hormel Chief Financial Officer Jacinth Smiley said on a call with analysts. Hormel on Thursday cut the high end of its earnings outlook for the year as it faces the impact of the bird flu, higher feed costs, rising transportation and labor expenses and Covid-19 restrictions in China. \"Our Jennie-O team went through a lot this quarter,\" Hormel Chief Executive James Snee said, adding that the virus was first detected in the company's supply chain in March. Hormel shares fell 5.5% in midday trading, with U.S. stock indexes slightly higher. The highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, the worst in seven years, has affected 36 states and led to the death of more than 5 million turkeys, according to the Agriculture Department. It has devastated egg-laying chicken flocks and sent the price of some poultry products, such as eggs, soaring in recent weeks. Turkey supplies already were tight before the outbreak, leading to some of the highest prices registered since the last bird flu outbreak in 2015, industry analysts said. Breast meat prices already have risen to levels higher than any point in 2015, trading around $6 a pound, and prices for other turkey products have increased as well, said Mr. Snee. Further flock losses could further increase prices, according to analysts. Though cases of avian influenza have slowed in May, they could pick back up as wild birds migrate south in the fall. This year's outbreak has largely been attributed to wild birds spreading the virus to farms as they migrate further north, agriculture industry officials have said, despite increased biosecurity since the outbreak in 2015 that led to the deaths of about 50 million birds. Biosecurity measures Hormel implemented since then have provided some protection against the virus, Mr. Snee said, and the number of company-managed turkeys impacted to date is 25% lower than the previous outbreak. Mr. Snee said that the company has started restocking farms and expects Hormel's turkey volumes to improve by the end of October, but to still be down compared with normal levels. Assuming no more outbreaks from this event or a recurrence in the fall, he said the company expects more-traditional volumes in the company's first quarter. Despite higher turkey meat prices, demand for Hormel's products remained strong for the quarter that ended May 1, company officials said. Consumers have shown signs of swapping some pricey meats, including beef, for cheaper products. Hormel reported higher sales and profit in its second quarter. Its Jennie-O brand posted a 387% rise in profit and officials noted strong demand from restaurants for its refrigerated foods products. Those businesses more than offset higher freight expenses and higher costs for certain items such as avocados, meat and packaging, said Mr. Snee. Staffing shortages and lower levels of cold storage capacity have left Hormel and other meat suppliers unable to meet customer demand, further lifting prices, industry officials have said. The company said feed prices are significantly higher, with corn and soybean meal prices up more than 125% and 40%, respectively, as of early May. High feed prices are expected to continue, company officials said, especially with farmers getting off to a late planting start this year due to cold and wet weather across the Midwest this spring. Overall, Hormel posted a profit of $261.6 million, or 48 cents a share, compared with $227.9 million, or 42 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected 47 cents a share. The company's sales rose 19% to $3.1 billion during the period, outpacing Wall Street expectations. Refrigerated foods sales were up 13% year over year thanks to higher pricing. Grocery products sales climbed 39%, largely due to Hormel's acquisition of the Planters nuts brand, which closed last year. Hormel's operating margin rose sequentially from the first quarter, as higher prices and other efforts offset the company's higher costs, executives said. The company said consumer demand remained robust despite higher prices. For the full year, Hormel now expects per-share earnings between $1.87 and $1.97, cutting the high end of its view by a nickel. The company maintained its sales guidance, projecting demand to remain strong.

{"id": "172", "fulltext": "VIDALIA, Ga. (AP) Officials have confirmed a highly contagious variety of bird flu in a backyard flock in southeast Georgia. Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black said Thursday it was the first confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in domesticated birds in Georgia this year. The Toombs County resident who kept the flock of chickens, turkeys, ducks, peafowl and other birds told WJBF-TV that dozens of his ducks died in a 24-hour period. He asked officials to investigate, and samples taken Monday confirmed the presence of bird flu. Officials killed more than 350 birds to prevent the spread of the disease and disinfected the farm. Georgia has the nation's largest poultry industry, and Black said that if bird flu spread to commercial operations, it would have a devastating impact on poultry farmers but also to the state's economy as a whole. Officials said Georgia was the 36th state where the H5N1 bird flu strain was found in domesticated birds, with tens of millions of birds affected. Before now, officials had only detected it in wild birds in Georgia. An earlier bird flu outbreak included a northwest Georgia chicken farm in 2017. Louise Zavala, executive director of the Georgia Poultry Laboratory, said officials are testing birds on all commercial poultry farms within 6 miles (10 kilometers). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says humans are at very low risk of contracting bird flu. One case was detected earlier this year in a Colorado state prisoner who was culling infected poultry. Infections in other countries sometimes happen among people who spend long periods unprotected around infected birds, the CDC says. Georgia has banned poultry shows, sales and swaps since February to try to keep the flu from spreading. Poultry flock owners who note large numbers of sick or dead birds are urged to call the Avian Influenza Hotline at 770-766-6850.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 3}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 4}]}
{"id": "173", "fulltext": "Controversial killing method used in 73% of culls this year despite vets urging its use to be limited The US poultry industry has increasingly switched to 'the most inhumane method available' to cull tens of millions of birds during the latest outbreak of avian influenza, according to government data. Outbreaks of the disease, also known as bird flu, have wreaked havoc across Europe and the US this year, with 38 million birds killed in the US so far. But how these birds are killed has generated controversy, with veterinarians and animal welfare campaigners urging an end to the use of the ventilation shutdown method, which kills animals by sealing off the airflow to the poultry sheds and increasing temperatures to lethal levels. Workers have described the method as like 'roasting animals alive.' European officials have said it should not be used in the European Union. In the US, however, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) lists ventilation shutdown with supplemental heat as 'permitted in constrained circumstances' for 'depopulation.' A new analysis has found that it has now become the main method for killing birds, used in nearly three-quarters of culls. The analysis of US Department of Agriculture (USDA) data by the Animal Welfare Institute found 73% of culls in the US in February and March (the most recent period for which data is available) involved the use of ventilation shutdown. This represents a dramatic shift from the last bird flu epidemic, in 2015, which resulted in the killing of 50 million farmed birds in the US. During that outbreak, the animals were predominantly killed by carbon dioxide poisoning or smothered in a blanket of firefighting foam. 'The default method of killing seems to have changed from foam to ventilation shutdown,' said Dena Jones, director of the AWI farm animal programme, who said the design of poultry housing 'ensures they won't be able to humanely kill them.' A USDA spokesperson said 'some housing designs do not allow for effective depopulation using foam' and that the carbon dioxide method was 'hindered by supply shortages.' The department financially compensates farmers for culling animals. Activists have protested against the widespread use of ventilation shutdown, most notably by disrupting basketball games to draw attention to Glen Taylor, the billionaire owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves team who also owns an Iowa egg farm where 5.3 million hens were killed using ventilation shutdown. A coalition of vets and animal rights advocates have urged the AVMA to reclassify the method as 'not recommended.' The lack of response so far from the AVMA 'harms animals and the veterinary profession's reputation as caring advocates for animals,' according to Crystal Heath, a vet and co-founder of the ethical veterinary group Our Honor. In the EU and the UK, birds are culled with carbon dioxide gas or nitrogen-infused foam, which are considered to be more humane methods than using firefighting foam when carried out correctly because they render the animals unconscious before killing them, Jones said. The European Food Safety Authority says ventilation shutdown should not be used, but there have been reports of producers in France being given emergency permission to use it. The EU also considers the use of firefighting foam to kill birds as inhumane because it entails 'drowning in fluids or suffocation by occlusion of the airways.' The USDA did not respond to a question about whether any steps were being taken to require less painful cull methods or prevent ventilation shutdown from becoming the default in future outbreaks.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 2}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 0}]}
{"id": "174", "fulltext": "PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona officials have confirmed the first cases in the Southwest of a bird flu that has led to the deaths of 37 million birds from commercial farms in the central and eastern U.S. The disease was spotted after tests by federal wildlife officials in three wild cormorants that had been found dead in a park in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale, Arizona Game and Fish officials announced this week. The disease has not yet been found in any domestic birds or in commercial operations, the agency said. But it is a concern, according to Glenn Hickman, president and CEO of Hickman Family Farms, one of the largest egg producers in the Southwest. Hickman operates four chicken ranches in Arizona, one in California and two in Colorado. The company has stopped any visits to its farms and double-checked its biosecurity program, which is designed to prevent its approximately 2 million chickens from being infected. Its chickens are kept in barns that are secured so that wild birds can't enter, and any people or tools that enter are disinfected. The company dodged a scare recently when the avian flu was found in a flock 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from one of its Colorado farms, Hickman said Thursday. And while he's concerned about the Scottsdale find, it's not anywhere near as concerning as if a nearby commercial operation had an outbreak. “Those are a lot scarier because the massive amount of virus that is potentially produced when you have a large population is much more than the relatively small amount of virus per bird in the wild bird population,” he said. None of his farms were affected. Arizona Game and Fish officials have been closely monitoring for the disease, which had been no closer than Colorado before this week's announcement, by responding to all calls of dead birds. Anne Justice-Allen, the department's wildlife veterinarian, said calls from the public alerted her agency to the dead cormorants, water-loving birds that often nest in groups. The three juveniles had fallen out of their nests and were spotted dead by morning walkers in the park, who called wildlife officials. “It's a good thing they did,” Justice-Allen said, because they were able to collect the birds and test them before park workers removed them. “We had a high suspicion that it was something that we do not normally see,” Justice-Allen said. “We have resident cormorants in the area, and we do not normally see mortality events in them.” Justice-Allen said a major concern is backyard flocks of chickens, which are allowed in parts of metro Phoenix. The disease has been found in many homeowner flocks across the country. Bird owners should watch for symptoms like birds not eating or lethargy, runny noses, seizures or diarrhea, she said. Anyone seeing those symptoms should call the state Department of Agriculture. The first U.S. detection of the new strain of highly contagious avian flu in domestic poultry was in February in Indiana. More than 37 million birds have been killed to prevent the infection from spreading since then. As of June 3, it had been detected in wild birds in 40 states, but not in California, Arizona, Nevada or New Mexico. Commercial flocks in 19 states have been infected. Once an infection is found, the birds won't recover and are killed to prevent spreading the illness, Justice-Allen said. The outbreak has not only killed domestic fowl. It has also had a heavy toll on bald eagles and other wild bird species, much more so than the nation's last bird flu outbreak detected in 2014. That outbreak cost more than 50 million domestic poultry. Hickman said egg producers are so far making up for lost production from outbreaks affecting flocks this year. “I think I can speak pretty firmly that regardless of how many birds that have been affected and depopulated, there are still eggs on every shelf in every grocery store in America,” Hickman said.

{"id": "175", "fulltext": "The virus that causes the deadly avian flu affecting millions of wild and domestic birds across the country has been detected in mallard ducklings in the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool on the Mall, the National Park Service said Wednesday. It was the first confirmation of the 'highly pathogenic avian influenza,' or HPAI, in Washington, the park service said. A 'die-off' of more than a dozen ducklings at the reflecting pool was discovered a few weeks ago, Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst said Wednesday. When the animals underwent necropsies, two were found to have been infected with bird flu. He said it was not yet clear what killed the others. The virus is rarely transmitted to humans. 'To date there has been only one documented human case of the currently circulating HPAI in the U.S.,' the Park Service said in a statement. 'We're not looking at another covid-type situation,' Litterst said. 'But because humans can unwittingly facilitate the transfer between groups of birds, we just want to get the word out there.' So far, 39 million birds have been affected in flocks in 36 states including 1.7 million in Maryland, 4 million in Pennsylvania and 1.4 million in Delaware, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Only 90 have been affected in Virginia. The current virus is believed to pose a low risk to the general public, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although 'some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection.' But people should avoid handling live or dead birds or coming into contact with their droppings as the virus can be easily moved around on shoes, the Park Service said. Visitors to the area should watch out for 'waterfowl feces,' and pets should be kept away from live or dead birds. People should report sick or dead birds to Park Service staff. The virus is highly contagious among some wild birds and can be deadly for bald eagles and vultures, the Park Service said. Mallards are less likely than many other waterfowl species to show signs of disease and can be infected without appearing sick. The term 'highly pathogenic' refers to the significant illness and mortality in poultry and other domestic birds that results from infection with this virus, the Park Service said. Elsewhere in the area, 80 black vultures in Maryland's Harford County were recently found dead due to the virus near wildlife areas along the Susquehanna River, officials have said. Vultures can be infected by scavenging infected dead birds. They were among about 950 cases in wild birds, including at least 54 bald eagles. Maryland and Delaware agriculture authorities said they have had reports of chickens at farms being infected with the bird flu since February. The vultures were found in recent weeks. 'The numbers are just staggering in terms of the poultry,' Charlie Broaddus, the state veterinarian in Virginia, said last month. One of the biggest factors in the bird flu's spread this year, he said, is that it's being carried by wild ducks and geese that are infected but 'don't typically become affected' by it. 'They're carriers,' Broaddus said, 'but the genetic sequence has the potential to make domestic birds much, much sicker.' Broaddus said the farms that have hens producing eggs that 'end up in the supermarket' tend to be large-scale operations, where the flu can spread quickly. Sometimes, he said, chickens at farms become infected when a farmer or worker 'accidentally tracks through goose droppings near a pond' and then brings it into the chicken facility. 'It takes just one to be infected before they spread it to others,' Broaddus said. Many wild birds don't always show signs of the virus, but it can easily be transmitted between birds through their droppings or through respiratory secretions, experts said. Agricultural officials at the Delaware-Maryland HPAI Joint Information Center said they were especially concerned about the vultures because they're scavengers, and 'if they eat a bird infected with avian influenza, whether it's a migratory bird such as a Canadian goose, other waterfowl, or another vulture, they will ingest the virus and then can get sick and die.' 'We want to ensure [that people] are taking steps to stop the spread of the virus so that they don't inadvertently transport it to other areas heavily populated with wild birds,' said Stacey Hofmann, a spokeswoman for the joint information center. Agriculture experts at the joint information center have advised the public to 'help limit the spread of the disease by not moving bird droppings via their shoes to other wild-bird habitats.' People should also change their shoes and clean off dirty shoes after they've visited a wild or natural area. Experts say that spraying shoe bottoms with a common household cleaner such as Lysol or a diluted bleach spray will kill the avian influenza virus, according to an information center statement. For those with pet birds or poultry at home, officials recommend they 'wash your hands, change clothes, and clean your shoes after visiting areas where wild birds frequent.'

New Zealand is to introduce a tax on sheep and cattle burps in an attempt to tackle one of the country’s largest sources of greenhouse gases.

European agriculture ministers are pushing for acceptance of a vaccination against highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry. The disease, also known as bird flu, has spread widely across the continent during the past two years, with the EU set to explore the potential of using vaccines to prevent the spread, rather than culling. Officials under former US president Donald Trump collaborated with the meatpacking industry to downplay the threat of Covid to plant workers and block public health measures that could have saved lives, a new investigation has found. Internal documents describe how industry representatives lobbied government officials to stifle pesky health departments from imposing evidence-based safety measures. More than 3,000 cows in New Mexico have been culled after toxic pollution from a nearby US military base was found to have contaminated their water source. The New Mexico Environment Department said it was helping clean up the waste and criticised the Department of Defense for poisoning the local farm’s cows, but failing to take responsibility for the pollution. Germany has reported a new outbreak of the deadly pig disease African swine fever (ASF) on a farm more than 300 miles (480km) from where other cases have been registered and just four miles from the French border. Due to better biosecurity ASF has so far not been as deadly in Germany or Italy as it was in China, where it devastated the industry. Leading animal rights organisations in Asia staged protests outside eight McDonald’s restaurants. The coalition of campaign groups called on the company to end its use of eggs produced in small cages across the continent. Meanwhile, McDonald’s shareholders have voted against a proposal to improve the treatment of pregnant pigs. Researchers in China have reportedly developed a process to clone pigs entirely through the use of robots, a development that may help the world’s largest pork consumer reduce its reliance on imported breeding pigs. The largest lab-grown meat plant in Asia is to be built in Singapore, opening next year. The country became the first government to allow the sale of lab-grown meat in 2020 and the new factory will be built by the US company Eat Just. UK news A third of migrant workers on UK fishing vessels who responded to a survey work 20-hour shifts, and around one-third reported regular physical violence, according to a new study. A campaign group has urged councils to drop meat from school dinners at least two days a week, despite critics saying activists are ignoring evidence. Animal Rebellion claims to have persuaded one English council to agree to its demands, but Jeremy Miles, the education minister for Wales, insisted meat should always be on the menu. Reducing stocking densities for broilers too quickly could threaten supplies of home-produced chicken, Tesco’s agricultural manager has warned. John Kirkpatrick said a move to increase the space given to chickens could reduce the amount of British poultry produced, it was reported. The UK’s biggest cheesemaker is set to receive a large fine after it admitted pollution and odour charges. Dairy Crest, which is owned by the Canadian firm Saputo, and makes brands including Cathedral City, admitted 21 pollution incidents, which led to fish dying in the River Inny in Cornwall. From the Animals Farmed series Danish mink breeders have turned their backs on the industry en masse after being forced to cull their animals over fears a Covid-19 mutation could pose a risk to humans. In November 2020, Denmark announced it would cull approximately 15 million animals, with the government temporarily banning mink farming and breeding for fur until 2023. Iceland is under pressure to ban the production of a hormone extracted from pregnant horses, a practice that has been described as cruel and animal abuse. Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) is used by farmers in the UK and Europe to increase reproduction in pigs, cows and other female farm animals. Animal welfare campaigners visiting farms discovered broken restraint boxes and enclosures covered in bite marks, which they claimed was a sign of anxious horses. Consumers could be hit with higher egg prices as UK farmers reduce their flock numbers, in response to escalating costs and insufficient profit margins. The numbers of chicks being placed by egg producers in April was down 15% year on year, according to the latest government figures. The low price of wool is pushing farmers to opt for moulting sheep, with shearing now costing more than the wool is worth. Farmers are switching to breeds that shed their own fleeces, and wool is seen as an optional extra to the meat that brings in the bulk of their income. The US poultry industry has increasingly switched to the most inhumane method available to cull tens of millions of birds during the latest outbreak of avian influenza, according to government data. Outbreaks of the disease have led to 38 million birds being killed in the US so far this year.

{"id": "177", "fulltext": "LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan has lifted a statewide ban on poultry and waterfowl exhibitions after 30 days passed with no new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in domestic birds. Bird shows can resume in the state, Michigan's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said in a statement Monday. The state halted poultry and waterfowl exhibitions May 10 as a precaution to protect against the spread of bird flu among poultry flocks. The ban was lifted Saturday. Even though the state has been able to reach this incredibly important benchmark, this does not mean the virus has left Michigan, State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland said in the statement. HPAI continues to be detected in wild birds throughout the state, which is not unexpected as the virus is known to be carried by wild birds. Avian flu has been spreading across the U.S., prompting farms to euthanize millions of birds. It can spread be spread from flock to flock, including wild birds, and through contact with infected poultry, equipment and caretakers. When it banned the shows, the state said transporting poultry from different flocks to one location, such as a county fair, creates a significant risk. In 2015, avian flu prompted a similar ban on Michigan poultry shows, affecting nearly 4,000 youth who participate in poultry 4-H projects at county fairs throughout the state. The latest outbreak of avian flu hit North America in December and has led to the culling of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in U.S. farms since February. At least a dozen non-commercial backyard flocks in nine Michigan counties have been infected, impacting a total 870 birds, MLive.com reported earlier.

{"id": "178", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A bird flu outbreak in the U.S. that led to the deaths of more than 40 million chickens and turkeys and contributed to a spike in egg and meat prices appears to be waning, but experts caution the virus hasn't disappeared and worry another surge could take hold this fall. The number of birds culled to limit its spread dropped from a peak of almost 21 million in March to less than 800,000 in May. However, more than 2 million birds have been killed already this month after infections were discovered at two large farms in Colorado. “The numbers in the dashboard do tell a story, but we are not ready to say the outbreak is winding down,” said Richard Coker, a spokesman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service division of the Department of Agriculture. “We remain vigilant and encourage producers to continue to practice strong biosecurity.” Some state and industry officials are optimistic that the outbreak is ending, although no one is quite ready to relax. Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said the virus still poses a risk because more cases are being reported, but that “It really does feel like we're on the tail end of it for this year.” When a case of the highly pathogenic virus is found, officials kill the entire flock to limit its spread. The virus doesn't discriminate between backyard flocks and massive egg farms; flocks of all sizes have been infected. Iowa, the nation's leader in egg production, was by far the hardest hit state with 13.4 million birds lost. No cases have been reported in the state since May 4, likely because migrating wild birds, which are blamed for spreading the virus, have moved out of Iowa. Nebraska lost nearly 4.9 million birds, Pennsylvania lost 4.2 million and Colorado saw 3.6 million birds killed. Minnesota and Wisconsin each lost about 3 million. An outbreak in 2015, when 50 million turkeys and chickens were killed, remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The government spent nearly $1 billion then to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. The USDA has so far approved $793 million to cover costs this year. National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Beth Breeding said the government payments “keep those losses from being catastrophic,” but they don't cover everything. For example, farmers lose income because they can't raise birds while their properties are being disinfected. Food prices have increased 10% overall this year, exceeding the 8.6% inflation reported last month. Egg prices soared the most, jumping 32%, while poultry prices are up nearly 17%. But agricultural economists say that while the bird flu outbreak contributed, spikes in the cost of feed, fuel and labor are much bigger factors. It didn't help that the outbreak peaked just as demand for eggs was highest around Easter, driving prices higher. But a relatively small proportion of the nationwide flock was affected. The 40 million birds killed represent only 6% of the chickens raised to produce eggs, 2.5% of turkeys and less than 1% of the chickens raised for meat. Economists expect egg and meat prices to ease this summer as farms are able to build back their flocks. “I think that there is going to start being some relief,” said Jada Thompson, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. The summer heat should help kill off the disease, but experts worry that the latest version of the virus may be hardy enough to survive the season, leading to a new outbreak when wild birds migrate later in the year. “We may have an even bigger peak this year in the fall, who knows?” University of Georgia researcher David Stallknecht said. “The honest answer is that we do not know what the future holds, but the reporting decline in commercial poultry cases is encouraging.” The prospects for a bird flu vaccine are uncertain; foreign markets are reluctant to import meat from inoculated birds, and vaccination can hide the presence of the virus meaning farmers would have to spend more to increase testing of their flocks. And vaccinated birds can still fall sick, just like vaccinated humans. “I personally do not see vaccine as something that's going to be used in the United States,” said John Clifford, the former U.S. chief veterinary officer who oversaw the USDA response to the 2015 outbreak. “Countries that don't export may feel different. We can't afford to lose those markets.” There is only so much farmers can do to limit the spread of bird flu. Farmworkers already usually have to shower and change clothes before they enter a barn, and tools for each barn are kept separate. Emily Metz, CEO of the American Egg Board trade group, said some farmers have invested heavily in combatting the virus, including upgrading ventilation systems and installing laser light systems to ward off wild birds. “If it does linger or come back, we're prepared. We're not letting our guard down,” Metz said. “The improvements our producers have made in terms of biosecurity are part of their everyday business.” ___ Associated Press reporter David Pitt contributed to this report from Des Moines, Iowa.

{"id": "179", "fulltext": "As a new version of bird flu spread through North America this spring, scientists began finding the virus in red foxes, bobcats and other mammals. Something was wrong with the foxes. That was what callers to the Dane County Humane Society in Wisconsin kept saying in April, as they reported fox kits, or young foxes, behaving in strange ways: shaking, seizing or struggling to stand. The kits, which were often lethargic and wandering by themselves, also seemed unusually easy to approach, showing little fear of humans. 'We just kept getting calls,' said Erin Lemley, a wildlife veterinary technician at the humane society's wildlife center. 'And the foxes started coming in.' Some of the kits that were admitted for treatment were quiet and withdrawn, she said. Others stumbled around or had seizures, their heads ticcing, their eyes flicking rhythmically. After the staff ruled out rabies, low blood sugar and other potential causes, laboratory testing revealed a surprising culprit: a highly virulent strain of avian influenza. 'It was not a fun surprise,' said Dr. Shawna Hawkins, a zoo and wildlife veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The virus, a type of bird flu known as Eurasian H5N1, has been spreading rapidly in the United States this spring, infecting flocks of farmed poultry in 36 states and prompting mass culls of domestic birds. But this version of the virus appears to be taking a much greater toll on wild birds than previous lineages have, finding its way into ducks, geese, gulls and terns, among many others. That, in turn, means that the virus poses an elevated danger to mammals that prey on those birds, including wild red foxes. At least seven U.S. states have detected the virus in red fox kits, to which the pathogen appeared to be particularly lethal. Two bobcats in Wisconsin, a coyote pup in Michigan and skunks in Canada have also tested positive for the virus, as have foxes, otters, a lynx, a polecat and a badger in Europe. (Two human cases, one in the United States and one in Britain, have been reported as well, both of which were in people who had close contact with birds.) There is no evidence that mammals play a significant role in spreading the virus, and the risk to humans remains low, experts said. 'This is very much still an avian virus,' said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. But evolution is a numbers game, he said, and the more mammals the virus infects, the more opportunities it has to pick up new mutations that could help it spread among foxes, bobcats or even humans. 'What it's going to take for this virus to transition from being a duck or a chicken virus to being a mammalian virus is more chances to replicate in those mammalian hosts,' Dr. Webby said. 'So that's why when we see these mammals being infected by this virus, we do take notice.' Twitching foxes The new lineage of the virus spread through Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia last year, sparking outbreaks in wild and domestic birds. It also showed up in a handful of wild mammals, including fox kits in the Netherlands in the spring of 2021. By the end of the year, the virus had made its way to North America. As it raced through the migrating American bird population this spring, reports began to emerge of infected fox kits first in Ontario and subsequently in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa, Alaska, Utah and New York. In some bird species, the virus caused obvious neurological symptoms, and many infected foxes displayed abnormal behaviors, too. They twitched, walked in circles and salivated excessively. In the most severe cases, the foxes developed seizures; death often followed shortly after, experts said. Post-mortem examinations revealed that many of the kits had pneumonia, said Dr. Betsy Elsmo, a diagnostic pathologist at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory who performed the necropsies. When she examined the animals' brain tissue under a microscope, Dr. Elsmo saw clear signs of damage. 'There was a lot of inflammation in the brain microscopically,' she said. 'The pattern of injury that I saw was consistent with a viral lesion.' So far, the virus appears to be taking a greater toll on fox kits than adult foxes, potentially because the young animals do not yet have fully developed immune systems, experts said. But the overall infection and mortality rate is unknown. 'We're just getting kind of anecdotal reports in nature right now,' said Michelle Carstensen, the wildlife health program supervisor for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Wisconsin officials also detected the virus in two adult bobcats this spring. 'Both bobcats showed reduced to no fear of humans,' Dr. Lindsey Long, wildlife veterinarian for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said in an email. 'They were noted sitting on porches and in close proximity to human activity without the usual fear response.' One bobcat seemed to be shivering, while the other appeared to be having trouble breathing, she added. The bobcats, which were euthanized, had microscopic brain lesions that were 'pretty much identical' to those in the affected foxes, Dr. Elsmo said. The virus was also recently detected in a coyote pup in Michigan, said Dr. Megan Moriarty, the wildlife veterinary specialist at the state's Department of Natural Resources. Scientists suspect that the animals are acquiring the virus by eating infected birds. In a laboratory study, researchers had previously demonstrated that red foxes that were fed infected bird carcasses could contract, and then shed, the virus. Although it is possible that the virus has evolved in ways that make it better at infecting mammals, scientists say that the most probable explanation for the sudden rise in infected mammals is that this lineage is infecting enormous numbers of wild birds, increasing the odds that hunters and scavengers might stumble across infected food sources. So far, the virus does not appear to be causing enough illness or death in wild mammals to put these species at risk, experts said. And there is no evidence of sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission. 'Mammals are generally considered to be dead-ends for highly pathogenic avian influenza,' Dr. Moriarty said. An early analysis of viral genomes from the Wisconsin fox kits suggests that the infections are essentially a series of one-offs — the result of individual foxes coming into contact with infected birds rather than foxes transmitting the virus to each other. 'The preliminary data that we have suggests that these are all independent spillover events,' Dr. Elsmo said. But much remains unknown, including whether the virus will establish itself in wild birds for the long haul, which could pose a sustained risk to mammals. And even isolated mammalian infections provide the virus with new opportunities to evolve. 'There's a risk of it adapting to and then transmitting between mammals, and then you have a new problem,' said Dr. Jolianne Rijks, a veterinarian at the Dutch Wildlife Health Center. Some state officials said that they had started more routinely testing sick mammals for the virus, especially ones with neurological symptoms. Animals that test positive should also have samples of their virus sequenced so scientists can monitor for any potentially worrisome changes, Dr. Webby said. Experts also encourage members of the public to report any wild animals that appear to be acting strangely. 'That's how all this started,' Dr. Elsmo said, 'as citizens seeing abnormally behaving kits and reporting them.' A rescued fox kit at the Dane County Humane Society.

{"id": "180", "fulltext": "The risk to humans from the disease, spread by wild birds, is low but a record level of outbreaks this year has researchers worried. Bird flu outbreaks rose nearly fivefold last year, creating an urgent need for research into preventing the spread of the disease, according to the head of a new consortium investigating the virus. The record of 26 outbreaks involving H5N1 in 2021 has been shattered, with 121 outbreaks involving the H5 serotype this year, according to Prof Ian Brown, head of virology at the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha). This may be due to the growing number of people keeping chickens or ducks, Brown said. Many of these keepers do not have to register with any authority because of the small numbers of birds involved. A good percentage of our cases have been in those types of setting, Brown said. They're in big commercial farms all the way down to somebody keeping two chickens in their back yard. So that is a massive shift in terms of the food security risk, public health risk, animal welfare and poultry exports. The Apha consortium was established by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) at breakneck speed after last year's outbreaks caused alarm and disruption among poultry farmers, and the first case of bird flu infecting a human in the UK. Over the past 10 years, we've had several bird flu events in the UK, but their frequency has been increasing, Brown said. Instead of coming every three or four years, we seem to be getting an event every year, and they're on a bigger scale. The risk to humans remains very low. Since bird flu emerged 20 years ago, about 600 cases have been recorded worldwide, with no human-to-human transmission. But the Covid pandemic has underlined the risks posed by other potential zoonotic diseases—ones that are transmitted to people from animals. The more humans are in contact with birds in an uncontrolled way, the greater is the theoretical risk that people can get infected, Brown said, adding that the UK has very good surveillance of viruses. If we can reduce the burden in birds, that also has a beneficial effect in reducing the risk to humans. Bird flu spreads to farmed birds from wild ones, and researchers are examining data collected over last winter to discover which practices make farms less vulnerable to infection. When the last winter's wave began, the government ordered that all birds be kept indoors—known in agriculture as housing rather than lockdown—which meant that free-range eggs were unavailable in Britain for five weeks. The virus moves between birds through close contact: it's droplet transmission—a bit like Covid, Brown said. Faeces and nasal secretions—bird snot—are other vectors. Infectious droppings from wild birds as they fly over farms may be part of the problem. Even at 4C, the virus will quite happily survive, infectious, for about eight weeks, he added. Another area of research is how and why wild birds fall sick: the illness is very distressing for the animals and often fatal. Thousands of birds have died in Scotland, most of them gannets nesting in close-knit colonies, as well as gulls and puffins. This is a concern because some of these are threatened species and defenceless against the virus. When these birds come to breed in summer, they get really close together. So it snowballs through these colonies. Wild bird migration is probably another factor, and some of the greatest mixing occurs in central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan, on an avian version of the Silk Road. The virus usually disappears from Europe in summer but this did not happen last year. It also reached North America for only the second time. Few birds cross the Atlantic, so it's likely that viruses were spread on by birds spending summer in the Arctic, which raises questions about whether the changing climate in the far north is also affecting the spread.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 10}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "This is a massive shift in terms of the food security risk, public health risk, animal welfare and poultry exports."}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "The Covid pandemic has underlined the risks posed by other potential zoonotic diseases—ones that are transmitted to people from animals."}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_3", "statement": "The more humans are in contact with birds in an uncontrolled way, the greater is the theoretical risk that people can get infected."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 9}, {"key": "deny_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "The risk to humans remains very low.

Crossing over to the Brough of Birsay, the tidal island, via a narrow causeway, I stumble across the first gannet.

{"id": "183", "fulltext": "SLOAN, Iowa (AP) — All spring, Addy Johnson feared a repeat of 2015, when the poultry barn at the Woodbury County Fair featured none of her feathered friends. “I’d go in there and look at the rabbits and the other side was empty and it was sad,” Addy said. Avian influenza, or bird flu, had swept the state, forcing commercial producers to destroy millions of chickens and turkeys. To contain the spread of the deadly virus, poultry and bird shows across Iowa were canceled. Addy and younger sister Brenna faced a repeat of that sad situation this year. Bird flu again hit Iowa in March, eventually being confirmed at 19 sites, including seven in Northwest Iowa, and forcing producers to destroy hundreds of thousands of birds. On March 23, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship canceled all live bird exhibitions at fairs. “It was weird. I had like an empty feeling,” Addy told the Sioux City Journal. She and Brenna already were raising dove and golden pheasant chicks on their rural Sloan acreage for their 4-H projects. It looked like they wouldn’t get the fun of showing them at the fair. “I was sad,” Brenna said. “Our hope was to wait and pray we would have one (a show).” On June 3, those prayers were answered. The state lifted the show ban after more than 30 days had passed since a new confirmed bird flu infection. The girls, both members of the Willow Workers 4-H Club, found out a couple days later at a 4-H awards banquet. (Nebraska also has lifted a similar bird show ban.) Addy and Brenna, who also show rabbits, horses and dogs at the fair and enter a number of other non-animal projects, will once again have a packed fair schedule, either showing their animals each day or helping friends with theirs. “It would have been weird to have a day off without the poultry show,” Addy said. Poultry and bird projects are among the most popular in Woodbury County, drawing approximately 190 entries last year, said Lujean Faber, the county’s Iowa State University Extension and Outreach youth development educator who also oversees the 4-H program. When there aren’t bird flu concerns, the poultry barn is filled with chickens of all colors and shapes, along with ducks, turkeys and other specialty birds like Addy and Brenna’s pheasants and doves. It’s a popular roost for children and adults surprised to learn there are many more types of chickens than the stereotypical white hen and red rooster. “I know when the public comes there, they enjoy seeing the wide variety of poultry,” Faber said. So do Addy and Brenna. Their mother, Jamie, showed yellow pheasants when she was in 4-H, and their grandmother Peggy Davidson hatches golden pheasants and raises other birds. Addy, 17, and Brenna, 14, were attracted to the colorful birds from their first year in 4-H. Addy’s shown bantams and fancy chickens in the past, and will show white doves and peach doves this year, her seventh in 4-H. Brenna was attracted to golden pheasants when she began 4-H five years ago. “I like the pheasants because I think they’re really pretty. I tried them my first year and thought they were pretty easy, so I kept with them,” said Brenna, who will be a Westwood High School freshman. Both Addy and Brenna plan to show four birds at the fair in August, so there’s much feeding, watering and watching them develop champion-worthy plumage to be done. It’s fun, said Addy, who will be a junior at Westwood, to hang out in the poultry barn answering questions from curious fairgoers who don’t have an agricultural background. After facing the reality of being unable to exhibit her pheasants, Brenna said she learned not to take them for granted. Come fair time, she’ll be among the hundreds of visitors appreciating the unique qualities of the different bird breeds. “People get to see crazy birds they don’t usually get to see,” she said. “I’m very excited. I love showing them.” You could say it makes her proud as a peacock. And, thanks to the lifting of the bird show ban, you might see a few of those, too, at this year’s fair. HOLD FOR RELEASE.

But this version of the virus appears to be taking a much greater toll on wild birds than previous lineages have, finding its way into ducks, geese, gulls and terns, among many others. That, in turn, means that the virus poses an elevated danger to mammals that prey on those birds, including wild red foxes. At least seven U.S. states have detected the virus in red fox kits, to which the pathogen appeared to be particularly lethal. Two bobcats in Wisconsin, a coyote pup in Michigan and skunks in Canada have also tested positive for the virus, as have foxes, otters, a lynx, a polecat and a badger in Europe. (Two human cases, one in the United States and one in Britain, have been reported as well, both of which were in people who had close contact with birds.) There is no evidence that mammals play a significant role in spreading the virus, and the risk to humans remains low, experts said. 'This is very much still an avian virus,' said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. But evolution is a numbers game, he said, and the more mammals the virus infects, the more opportunities it has to pick up new mutations that could help it spread among foxes, bobcats or even humans. 'What it's going to take for this virus to transition from being a duck or a chicken virus to being a mammalian virus is more chances to replicate in those mammalian hosts,' Dr. Webby said. 'So that's why when we see these mammals being infected by this virus, we do take notice.' Twitching foxes The new lineage of the virus spread through Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia last year, sparking outbreaks in wild and domestic birds. It also showed up in a handful of wild mammals, including fox kits in the Netherlands in the spring of 2021. By the end of the year, the virus had made its way to North America. As it raced through the migrating American bird population this spring, reports began to emerge of infected fox kits -- first in Ontario and subsequently in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa, Alaska, Utah and New York. In some bird species, the virus caused obvious neurological symptoms, and many infected foxes displayed abnormal behaviors, too. They twitched, walked in circles and salivated excessively. In the most severe cases, the foxes developed seizures; death often followed shortly after, experts said. Post-mortem examinations revealed that many of the kits had pneumonia, said Dr. Betsy Elsmo, a diagnostic pathologist at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory who performed the necropsies. When she examined the animals' brain tissue under a microscope, Dr. Elsmo saw clear signs of damage. 'There was a lot of inflammation in the brain microscopically,' she said. 'The pattern of injury that I saw was consistent with a viral lesion.' So far, the virus appears to be taking a greater toll on fox kits than adult foxes, potentially because the young animals do not yet have fully developed immune systems, experts said. But the overall infection and mortality rate is unknown. 'We're just getting kind of anecdotal reports in nature right now,' said Michelle Carstensen, the wildlife health program supervisor for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Wisconsin officials also detected the virus in two adult bobcats this spring. 'Both bobcats showed reduced to no fear of humans,' Dr. Lindsey Long, wildlife veterinarian for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said in an email. 'They were noted sitting on porches and in close proximity to human activity without the usual fear response.' One bobcat seemed to be shivering, while the other appeared to be having trouble breathing, she added. The bobcats, which were euthanized, had microscopic brain lesions that were 'pretty much identical' to those in the affected foxes, Dr. Elsmo said. The virus was also recently detected in a coyote pup in Michigan, said Dr. Megan Moriarty, the wildlife veterinary specialist at the state's Department of Natural Resources. Scientists suspect that the animals are acquiring the virus by eating infected birds. In a laboratory study, researchers had previously demonstrated that red foxes that were fed infected bird carcasses could contract, and then shed, the virus. Although it is possible that the virus has evolved in ways that make it better at infecting mammals, scientists say that the most probable explanation for the sudden rise in infected mammals is that this lineage is infecting enormous numbers of wild birds, increasing the odds that hunters and scavengers might stumble across infected food sources. So far, the virus does not appear to be causing enough illness or death in wild mammals to put these species at risk, experts said. And there is no evidence of sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission. 'Mammals are generally considered to be dead-ends for highly pathogenic avian influenza,' Dr. Moriarty said. An early analysis of viral genomes from the Wisconsin fox kits suggests that the infections are essentially a series of one-offs -- the result of individual foxes coming into contact with infected birds rather than foxes transmitting the virus to each other. 'The preliminary data that we have suggests that these are all independent spillover events,' Dr. Elsmo said. But much remains unknown, including whether the virus will establish itself in wild birds for the long haul, which could pose a sustained risk to mammals. And even isolated mammalian infections provide the virus with new opportunities to evolve. 'There's a risk of it adapting to and then transmitting between mammals, and then you have a new problem,' said Dr. Jolianne Rijks, a veterinarian at the Dutch Wildlife Health Center. Some state officials said that they had started more routinely testing sick mammals for the virus, especially ones with neurological symptoms. Animals that test positive should also have samples of their virus sequenced so scientists can monitor for any potentially worrisome changes, Dr. Webby said. Experts also encourage members of the public to report any wild animals that appear to be acting strangely. 'That's how all this started,' Dr. Elsmo said, 'as citizens seeing abnormally behaving kits and reporting them.'

{"id": "185", "fulltext": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — An unusual number of seals are becoming stranded and dying off Maine this summer, and avian influenza is to blame, the federal government said Tuesday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed that samples from four Maine seals tested positive for the virus. The animals all died or required euthanasia, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Marine mammal rescuers started to notice an unusually high number of seal strandings in June, and then the USDA conducted the tests, NOAA said in a statement. The rate of dead seal strandings in Maine is about three times the normal rate for the summer and is close to 60, the agency said. The USDA is notifying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state animal and public health officials about the deaths, which came after a bird flu outbreak that led to the deaths of tens of millions of chickens and turkeys on farms. The virus is capable of jumping to mammals, though it rarely affects humans. It's not the first instance of bird flu jumping to marine mammals such as seals, but the federal government is monitoring the deaths closely nonetheless, said Allison Ferreira, a NOAA spokesperson. 'There is a national outbreak of avian flu happening, so that was the cause of concern for these animals,' Ferreira said. Most of the seals that have been founded stranded in Maine this summer have been dead, NOAA said. The dead seals have included gray seals and harbor seals. The health risk posed by avian flu to the general public is low; however, precautions are recommended, NOAA's statement said. The agency said people and pets should never approach seals, and should contact authorities if they find an animal they believe is stranded. Elsewhere in New England, hundreds of birds have washed up dead on Martha’s Vineyard, and local officials have sounded the alarm about a possible bird flu outbreak. The source of the outbreak among seals is still being investigated. Marine Mammals of Maine, a rescue organization, that it has responded to 40 stranded seals since June 1. Katy Green, a spokesperson for the organization, said it is 'aware of this evolving situation' and working with NOAA on it. Gray seals and harbor seals are abundant off New England, where they are beloved by wildlife watchers and sometimes bemoaned by fishermen. However, the bird flu deaths don't represent the first time they've died off at an alarming rate. NOAA declared an 'unusual mortality event' for the seals after more than 2,700 of them stranded off Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts from July 2018 to March 2020. Feds attributed those deaths to phocine distemper virus. That virus does not impact humans.

{"id": "186", "fulltext": "Unusually high numbers of the marine mammals were found stranded in the last two months along Maine's coast. Samples from four seals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza. The highly pathogenic avian influenza strain that has whipped through flocks of domestic poultry and wild birds this year may also be to blame for a spike in seal strandings in Maine, U.S. officials said on Wednesday. Samples from four recently stranded seals—all of which died or were sick enough to require euthanasia—tested positive for the virus. The strain, officially known as Eurasian H5N1, primarily affects birds. After causing outbreaks in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the virus arrived in North America late last year and quickly spread to commercial poultry farms and along migratory bird routes. The recent outbreaks involving the latest version of the virus have taken a much greater toll on wild birds than previous cycles did. And that has put mammals that feed on wild birds, or have close contact with them, at risk. Scientists have now found the virus in a variety of wild mammals in North America, including foxes, bobcats, skunks and raccoons. \"The seal is the first marine mammal that we've seen on the spillover end,\" Dr. Julianna Lenoch, a national wildlife disease program coordinator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said at a news briefing on Wednesday. \"But this is not unexpected to have bird flu move into mammalian species on occasion.\" Workers with Marine Mammals of Maine, an organization that responds to reports of stranded sea creatures, began noticing an unusually high number of stranded seals last month. From May 10 to July 4, 92 gray and harbor seals were reported stranded in Maine. Many of the seals were found dead. The current rate of dead seal strandings is roughly three times as high as normal, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Other stranded seals were ill, with symptoms that included lethargy, sneezing and coughing. Some also had seizures—a symptom that has been reported in fox kits infected with avian influenza. Marine Mammals of Maine sent samples from eight stranded seals to Tufts University for laboratory testing, Lynda Doughty, the organization's executive director, said at the briefing. Four tested positive for the virus. Most of the strandings so far have been reported in mid-to-southern Maine. \"But there is the potential for this to spread across our coast as live animals move,\" said Ainsley Smith, the coordinator for stranded marine mammals at N.O.A.A.'s Greater Atlantic regional fisheries office. Viruses have been responsible for other mass stranding events among marine mammals, and previous versions of avian influenza have caused fatal outbreaks in seals. The seals are likely catching the virus when they come into close contact with infected birds, or virus-laden bird droppings, after coming ashore, Dr. Deborah Fauquier, a veterinary medical officer at N.O.A.A, said in an email. Officials have not found any bird remains in the stomachs of the seals that have been necropsied, she added. Seals can spread at least some versions of the flu to other seals. However, there is not yet any evidence that this has happened in Maine, said Bryan Richards, the emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center. \"With all of the scavenging mammals, and now with seals, I don't think we have any evidence at all suggesting that each individual animal is anything other than, literally, a dead-end host,\" he said. Although the risk to humans remains low, the infection of mammals increases the odds that the virus could mutate in ways that make it more likely to pose a danger to people. Versions of avian flu that have been isolated from seals during previous outbreaks have shown signs of adaptation to mammals. In the past, similar versions of bird flu have tended to peter out in the summer, when temperatures rise. It is too soon to say whether that will happen this year, Dr. Lenoch said: \"This particular avian influenza is acting a little bit different, so we're going to remain on high alert.\" In the meantime, officials recommended that people and their pets stay a safe distance away from seals and other marine mammals and report stranded animals to the local wildlife authorities.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 8}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "deny_evolve_statement_1", "statement": "With all of the scavenging mammals, and now with seals, I don't think we have any evidence at all suggesting that each individual animal is anything other than, literally, a dead-end host,"}]}
{"id": "187", "fulltext": "RSPB calls for greater regulation of industry to avoid putting native wildlife at risk Pheasant shoots across the UK are being shut down or dramatically scaled back this year because of import bans on the birds after an outbreak of bird flu. A huge number of the gamebirds shot in the country are imported from factory farms in Europe. Experts have said this practice should stop or be reduced because it risks spreading disease and has troubling implications for native nature and biodiversity. Just under 50 million pheasants are usually released each year from continental farms. A recent study suggested that at their peak in August each year, non-native common pheasants and red-legged partridges make up about half of all wild bird biomass in Britain. The annual shooting season begins on 1 October. Jeff Knott, the central and eastern England director at the RSPB, said: 'The most important thing from our perspective is the bird flu situation underlines the risks of importing and releasing millions of birds into the British countryside with very little oversight. It is a very, very unregulated industry and it is something that needs to be looked really hard at.' He called for more regulation for shoots. 'There are inherent risks with bringing so many birds in, and releasing them into the countryside. There is a need to look at greater regulation of the industry to make sure we are not putting native wildlife at risk. Estates don't have to report how many they are bringing in, releasing, how many are being shot.' Mark Avery, who co-runs the nature campaign group Wild Justice, said: 'This is a wake-up call for shooting. Importing tens of millions of non-native pheasants is hardly traditional or sustainable. The environment will benefit all those gamebirds harm our native species. Pheasants gobble up snakes and lizards and damage vegetation. Fewer gamebirds is respite for native wildlife.' Shooting estates are putting measures in place including more breeding of the gamebirds on site to make the sector more resilient to import bans. Glynn Evans, the head of game and gundogs at the British Association of Shooting and Conservation (BASC), said: 'For a number of reasons such as the climate, parts of France are ideal places for game farming and the production of pheasant and partridge eggs. However, an outbreak of avian influenza in the main game farming regions at a critical time of such production has seen restrictions placed on movement. The resulting impact on game shooting in the UK this year will be nothing short of significant. This level of disruption will vary between different shoots. For example, those who hatch and rear their own birds in-house will be largely unaffected, whereas others may be proceeding with scaled-back plans, and we have heard of shoots taking the tough decision not to proceed this year.' He said the reduction in shooting would hit the rural economy, including hotels, pubs and restaurants near shooting estates. 'This is not the first challenge we have faced and it will not be the last. With avian influenza becoming increasingly prevalent, shoots will be looking at their supply chains and how to secure them for the future,' Evans added. This year's outbreak of bird flu has been the longest and largest ever experienced in the UK and in many parts of Europe. The disease is not only infecting farmed birds but is also sweeping through vulnerable populations of endangered birds, which is alarming conservationists. The disease, highly contagious in birds, started in commercial geese farms in Asia in 1996, spreading to poultry farms and then to wild birds.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 6}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "The most important thing from our perspective is the bird flu situation underlines the risks of importing and releasing millions of birds into the British countryside with very little oversight."}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "There are inherent risks with bringing so many birds in, and releasing them into the countryside."}, {"key": "affirm_evolve_statement_1", "statement": "With avian influenza becoming increasingly prevalent, shoots will be looking at their supply chains and how to secure them for the future."}, {"key": "affirm_pandemic_statement_1", "statement": "With avian influenza becoming increasingly prevalent, shoots will be looking at their supply chains and how to secure them for the future."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 2}, {"key": "deny_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "The resulting impact on game shooting in the UK this year will be nothing short of significant.

{"id": "188", "fulltext": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The deaths of dozens of seals off the coast of Maine has been deemed an 'unusual mortality event,' sparking a federal investigation into strandings that appear linked to avian influenza. The seal strandings began in June and 159 have been reported through Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Most of the seals were found dead. NOAA gave the strandings, which have affected harbor and gray seals, the 'unusual' designation on Friday. That authorizes a federal investigation to try to determine the cause and minimize deaths. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has already confirmed that samples from four stranded seals tested positive for avian flu, which has been found in more than 40 states since it was detected in winter 2021. The risk to the public from the occurrence of avian flu in seals is low, but beachgoers should take precautions anyway, NOAA representatives said. 'We continue to ask the public not to touch ill, stranded or floating dead seals, to keep pets far away from seals, and to call their local stranding network organization to report live or dead stranded seals,' the agency said in a statement. Most strandings have happened in the southern and central coast of the state from Biddeford to Boothbay, NOAA said. Neither animal is listed under the Endangered Species Act, but both are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The avian flu outbreak has killed tens of million of chickens and turkeys on farms, and the virus is able to jump to mammals. It rarely affects humans. NOAA said it's working with local, state, tribal, federal and international groups on its investigation. Marine Mammals of Maine, a rescue agency, has reported responding to dozens of seal strandings since the beginning of June. 'Strandings have continued to increase,' said Lynda Doughty, founding executive director of the group. 'It has been a really busy season of strandings for us. Our groups are trying to catch all the reports, as much as possible.' Avian influenza has also been detected in dozens of species of wild birds as well as eight species of scavenging mammals, NOAA said.

{"id": "190", "fulltext": "Avian virus outbreak in France and trade barriers have left gamekeepers facing redundancy and shoots likely to go bankrupt. Bird flu has managed to do to game shooting what animal rights activists have been trying to achieve for decades with a little help from Brexit. Dozens of pheasant and partridge shoots have been called off ahead of the shooting season after an unprecedented outbreak of avian flu in France left gamekeepers in the UK with few birds to rear. At least 93 gamekeepers have been made redundant so far this year and some shoots are likely to go bankrupt, according to Dominic Boulton, former chair of the Game Farmers' Association and now its policy adviser. 'That's 93 families that by and large will have had accommodation that comes with their job, and a vehicle,' he said. 'So they may well be facing the loss of everything. There's going to be a significant number of shoots that don't go ahead this year.' About 70% of partridge shoots and nearly a third of planned pheasant shoots may be cancelled this year, according to estimates by Guns On Pegs, a shooting agency. That means a huge reduction in the 57 million red-legged partridges and pheasants reared and released each year in the UK. Grouse shooting, which heralds the start of the shooting season on 12 August with the 'Glorious Twelfth' will not be affected because grouse are not reared and released. Groups such as Wild Justice have campaigned for a reduction in releases, saying that only 30% of the birds are shot and retrieved, which means the survivors indirectly affect protected wildlife. The RSPB says that birds of prey are killed illegally to protect game birds. It also objects to the use of poisonous lead ammunition, which the government is considering outlawing. This year's dramatic reduction in game birds will also affect beaters, catering companies and restaurants, Boulton said, adding that 75% of rural land is managed for shooting of some type including game, and the industry is worth about £1.4bn. The initial signs of disruption came at the end of February when the first case of bird flu was discovered in the Loire valley. 'Roughly half of the birds that we rear in this country originate from an egg laid in France,' Boulton said, estimating that about 90% of partridges and 40% of pheasants come from producers, with 'virtually all' in the Loire valley. After avian flu is detected on a farm, the birds are culled and 30 days later the farmer can start trading birds domestically which for French farmers means within the EU. But international exports must wait for 90 days, under World Organisation for Animal Health guidelines adopted into UK and EU law. The National Gamekeepers' Organisation (NGO) campaigned for the government to create special licences allowing imports before the 90 days were up. After weeks of negotiations, ministers reached an agreement with the EU for a 'bespoke arrangement' but not France. 'Even if we were still in the EU and operating under the 30-day rule, we would still have been in trouble,' Boulton said, adding that French officials had created false hope among shooters that imports might restart in time. 'If you want to start shooting on 1 October [when the pheasant season begins], your birds need to be eight weeks old by the end of June when they can be released into the wild.' The last outbreak in France was detected on 17 May and 16 million farmed birds, including poultry, were culled. By 22 June, there had been 1,464 bird flu cases, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). French farmers have been devastated. Otto Tepasse founded his central London restaurant, Otto's, on traditional French cuisine. Canard à la Presse is his signature dish, made with Challans ducks from the Maison Burgaud farm in the Loire. 'I have not been serving any duck since it started,' he said. 'This farm has been in business since the 1930s and they are the main farm for three-star Michelin restaurants. Now everything has been wiped out.' The farm was given the all-clear only in mid-July, he said, but they are now trying to find new stock. Diners will have to wait until the end of September before they can eat his pressed duck again. Bird flu has been reported in 35 European countries in 2022, and the UK saw a near fivefold increase in cases to 122 so far this year. Free-range eggs were unavailable for five weeks because the outbreaks meant that British chickens had to be kept inside, and last month Defra established a research consortium led by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) to investigate how to prevent the spread of the virus. Outbreaks killed thousands of seabirds in the Farne Islands off the coast of Northumberland earlier this month, and thousands more gannets, gulls and puffins across Scotland, leading to a ban on visitors to 23 Scottish islands. The virus spreads from wild birds to captive ones, possibly through droppings and direct contact. One theory of how the virus circulates is that the birds that migrate to the Arctic during the summer then pass it to each other. Birds also mix in central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan on migration routes. The NGO said it was too early to say how the shooting season would be affected, but its chairman, David Pooler, was pleased with how the government had acted. 'We have been assured that the government is trying to put in place measures which would prevent similar incidents from happening again in future.' A Defra spokesperson said the department had tried to balance the egg trade with the country's 'high standards of biosecurity following this year's avian influenza outbreak. Unfortunately, due to a range of external factors, it was not possible to put measures in place in time for this year's shooting season. We are aware this will have an impact, and we are exploring how we can alleviate these pressures going forward.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 1}, {"key": "deny_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "We have been assured that the government is trying to put in place measures which would prevent similar incidents from happening again in future."}]}
{"id": "191", "fulltext": "Dozens of coastal sites in the UK closed to the public as H5N1 continues to sweep through wild bird populations across the world A quarter of Europe's breeding seabirds spend spring in the UK, turning our coastline into a giant maternity unit. These noisy outcrops usually stink of bird poo. However, this year has been different. Instead of the smell of guano, it's the smell of death, says Gwen Potter, a National Trust countryside manager working on the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland. It's completely horrendous. This annual congregation of life has turned into a super-spreader event, as a highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5N1 also known as bird flu sweeps through populations of breeding birds, causing devastating losses. More than 300 outbreaks have been reported in UK seabird colonies, and dozens of coastal sites have closed to the public. The Farne Islands are home to 200,000 seabirds, including Arctic terns, Atlantic puffins, guillemots, kittiwakes and razorbills. Potter is one of many conservationists swapping binoculars for a hazmat suit, picking up the bodies of birds she has spent her career trying to protect. Birds will sit on the ground, unable to move, twisting into unnatural positions, before dying. It is happening with chicks, too, still gently trying to flap as they die. It sweeps through, takes everything in its path. It doesn't seem to spare anything, really we've collected thousands of dead birds, and that's the tip of the iceberg. It's just the scale of it which is hard to grasp, she says. Early observations suggest that how closely the birds nest is a key factor in how quickly the virus is transmitted. Guillemots nest quite densely, and kittiwakes are often next to them, which makes them vulnerable, although there is more space between them. Terns also nest densely and already 25% of the 350 sandwich terns on the Farne Islands are thought to have died, according to Potter. Some seabird chicks jump into the sea prematurely if their parents have died, while others starve in the nest. Most seabirds will fly away in the coming weeks once their chicks are raised, but the true impact on populations will not be known for a few years, with concerns that some may never recover. I don't want to contemplate that because it will make me cry, says Potter. Britain has about 8 million seabirds, including 90% of the world's Manx shearwater and about two-thirds of northern gannets and great skuas. Any impact on these populations is of global conservation significance. Tens of thousands of birds must have died, maybe hundreds of thousands. It seems as though this breeding season will have been a disaster. Many will have died on remote islands, but the monitoring is nowhere near good enough, says the ornithologist Mark Avery, who describes the deaths so far as an international disaster. Already, it looks very serious and I fear this is just the start. Seabirds are particularly vulnerable because they are typically long-lived animals that don't reach breeding age until they are about five years old. They generally only have a few chicks, so populations take longer to recover. Nationally, the three species that are most at risk are the great skua, gannet and sandwich tern, according to Niall Burton, from the British Trust for Ornithology. We are talking about very long-term recovery. It's something that is unprecedented, certainly in my lifetime The world population of great skua is about 16,000 and early research on the impact of the disease suggests that between 64% and 85% of the population at some sites has died, mainly in Shetland, Orkney and the Outer Hebrides. Burton says it will take several years for populations to recover but that it was too early to be more exact. The biggest population of gannets on the planet, at Bass Rock, an island off the coast of North Berwick, in East Lothian, Scotland, has been badly impacted. Gannets nest in large colonies and there are few of them in the UK as a whole. Bird flu seems to be present in most of them, with a few exceptions in Ireland and Wales. Across the Channel, 10% of France's total breeding population of sandwich terns is believed to have died in the space of a week, with high casualties also reported in the Netherlands. Coquet Island, off the Northumberland coast, is the UK's only colony for breeding roseate terns, with about 150 breeding pairs. More than two-thirds of chicks have died. We are talking about very long-term recovery. It's something that is unprecedented, certainly in my lifetime, says Burton. The story of this latest bird flu epidemic dates back to 1996 when the H5N1 strain was found in a population of commercial geese in Asia. In 2005, wild birds started dying en masse. The current wave of the H5N1 strain has resulted in more than 77 million domestic birds being culled. About 400,000 non-poultry birds which includes wild birds are reported to have died, which is double the number of deaths in the previous wave, in 2016-17. For the first half of this year, H5N1 was a problem for domestic poultry, leading all chickens to be shut inside between November last year and May, with the result that at one point it was impossible to get UK free-range eggs. Already there were reports of the disease's impact on wild wintering populations, including the death of more than one-third of the Svalbard barnacle goose population on the Solway Firth (16,500 out of a total population of 43,000). There were reports of birds falling from the sky in distress With the arrival of spring, the problem escalated. It is now considered to be the worst ever bird flu outbreak in the UK, noted for the large area it has affected but also high levels of chick mortality. Almost every country in Europe has had cases in the latest outbreak, as well as those in North America, west Africa and Asia. Fragmented bird populations are most at risk. There are about 8,000 Dalmatian pelicans left in the world, and more than 2,000 have already died from bird flu. We are facing an event of mass extinction of animals. Entire populations are affected by this virus, says Uri Naveh, a senior scientist at the Israel Parks and Nature Authority. Early observations suggest that about 50% of birds infected with the virus die from it, but Prof Diana Bell, a conservation biologist at the University of East Anglia, who studied the H5N1 strain back in 2007, says the figure is more like 100%. Anything that gets infected is not going to survive, unless the H5N1 has attenuated in its virulence during that time, but I don't think so, she says. I look in horror at what it is doing to our birds we just have to really hope there are a decent number that have survived, but I don't think it's because they've had it and they've recovered. Bell's research suggests it affects birds in most orders. Tigers have been fed infected poultry and died, she says, and there have recently been reports of seals dying from it in the US. In terms of how the virus will spread, Prof Paul Digard, the chair of virology at the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, says it is impossible to generalise from one species to another, so he doesn't believe it will kill 100% of those it infects, partly because of intrinsic genetic differences, and partly because of factors such as stress, age and other traits in specific populations. He says H5N1 is causing a huge amount of damage because it is spreading among populations that have not had the virus before, but that this will change in the future because some will survive. My guess is that things will calm down over time as populations gain immunity to this circulating strain of virus. I would hope not to see the same levels of mortality in the coming years, but that's something of a guess, he says. The main factors contributing to its spread are international trade, the farming and sale of birds, and the migration of wild birds, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health. Birds that have no symptoms could be super-spreaders because they can still fly long distances. However, Bell says she has never heard of an asymptomatic bird with the virus and therefore doesn't think wild birds would be able to spread it over long distances. She believes the international poultry trade is the main driver of the virus and says stopping imports of chicks and birds for the trade would be an important step in reducing the risk of future outbreaks. Originally, it was poultry to wild birds; it was not wild birds which were spreading it. It was frustrating to see wild birds being blamed we've got to get out of our heads that the wild birds are the bad guys here, she says. The public should keep their distance from any carcasses and report them to the government helpline. At the moment it does not appear to be infecting humans, but previous strains of the virus have. If you see a sick bird, leave it be, I'm afraid, says Digard. Don't take it to an animal shelter. You are potentially signing a death warrant for all the other birds in that shelter. The most important thing would be better surveillance of the situation, says Potter, who believes there needs to be a government-led plan for all four UK countries, with guidance for effective carcass collection and testing, and better biosecurity on poultry farms. Seabirds have already been hit by a range of threats, including habitat loss, overfishing and climate change; their populations have halved since the 1980s. Reducing these other pressures would make them more resilient to bird flu. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: There are limited effective actions that can be taken to protect wild birds, as opposed to captive bird flocks. Due to the migratory habits of wild birds, it will only be with breeding season monitoring next year that the full impact will become apparent. However, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) carries out year-round avian influenza surveillance of dead wild birds, and clear public guidance has been issued not to handle their carcasses. This article was amended on 3 & 5 August 2022 because an earlier version was wrong to say that St Abb's Head, in Berwickshire, Scotland has the biggest population of gannets on the planet, and that has been halved.

{"id": "194", "fulltext": "LOCUST GROVE, Ga. (AP) — Bird flu has killed hundreds of wild black vultures at a Georgia sanctuary that houses more than 1,500 other animals. No other birds at Noah's Ark have tested positive for or shown symptoms of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, sanctuary officials told news outlets. An outbreak of the virus has led to the deaths of 40 million chickens and turkeys and about 2,000 wild birds this year. The wild birds include more than 240 black vultures and nearly 220 bald eagles, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Even seals have died from it. Officials said they were told Saturday that initial tests indicate the black vultures that roost at Noah's Ark died of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. State authorities were notified when an unusual number of dead vultures were found Aug. 13, according to a statement released to news outlets. At least 700 black vultures have died, Noah's Ark animal care manager Allison Hedgecoth told WXIA-TV. State workers euthanized 20 to 30 other birds, she said. \"All of our chickens were euthanized yesterday and our turkeys and our guinea hens,\" she said. The station reported that the sanctuary is home to more than 500 birds. Those include an ostrich, emus, a peacock, two sandhill cranes, cockatoos, and a Eurasian eagle owl, according to the sanctuary's website. Noah's Ark is in Locust Grove, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Atlanta. It's more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of the area where hundreds of birds in a mixed backyard flock died or were euthanized earlier this year and most of the previously reported 15 wild bird deaths from the virus were located. A sign on the Noah's Ark website said it will be closed through Sept. 3. Georgia's Department of Agriculture and Department of Natural Resources set up a six-mile (9.6 kilometer) perimeter around the sanctuary in hope of containing the spread, according to WXIA. \"With birds that are able to move around and airborne, this disease could spread pretty rapidly if it's not contained very quickly,\" State Sen.

A note on the Noah's Ark website Tuesday said the sanctuary, which houses more than 1,500 animals in Locust Grove, will be closed until Sept. 30. However, the state veterinarian, Dr. Janemarie Hennebelle, said in a video Friday that birds there will be quarantined for at least five months. Just over 100 were euthanized because they were at high risk for the virus, she said. Noah's Ark said euthanized birds included peacocks, peahens, emus, ostrich, Guinea fowl, chickens, turkeys and geese, one owl, one crow and one sandhill crane. \"These species of birds can be carriers of the avian influenza and were exposed to the vulture population that has been dying off,\" it said in Monday's unsigned statement. Noah's Ark still has hundreds of birds which are alive and well, the sanctuary said. Hennebelle and state Agriculture Secretary Gary Black did not identify Noah's Ark by name, describing it only as a non-commercial flock in Henry County. The state Agriculture Department was notified Aug. 13 that an unusual number of black vultures had died, and was told five days later that domestic ducks were showing bird flu symptoms, Hennebelle said. She said samples were taken from the ducks on Aug. 19, and three days later a federal lab confirmed that it was the H5N1 strain.

{"id": "196", "fulltext": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Bird flu has returned to the Midwest earlier than authorities expected after a lull of several months, with the highly pathogenic disease being detected in two commercial turkey flocks in western Minnesota and a hobby flock in Indiana, officials said Wednesday. The disease was detected after a farm in Meeker County reported an increase in mortality last weekend, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health said. The flock was euthanized to stop the spread. The board later reported that a second flock in the county tested positive Tuesday evening. They were the first detections of avian influenza in Minnesota since May 31, when a backyard flock was struck in Becker County. Indiana's case was its first since a backyard flock there tested positive June 8, which had been the last detection in the Midwest before this week. However, there have been several detections in western states in July and August, including California, where a half-dozen commercial farms have had to kill more than 425,000 chickens and turkeys since last week. There have also been cases in Washington, Oregon and Utah, plus a few in some eastern states. While the timing of this detection is a bit sooner than we anticipated, we have been preparing for a resurgence of the avian influenza we dealt with this spring, said Dr. Shauna Voss, the board's senior veterinarian. PAI is here and biosecurity is the first line of defense to protect your birds. The Indiana State Board of Animal Health reported that a small hobby flock of chickens, ducks and geese in northern Indiana's Elkhart County tested presumptively positive on Tuesday, though final confirmation from a federal lab was pending. Across the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 414 flocks in 39 states have been affected since February, costing producers over 40 million birds, mostly commercial turkeys and chickens. The disease has struck 81 Minnesota flocks this year, requiring the killing of nearly 2.7 million birds. Minnesota produces more turkeys annually than any other state. This year's outbreak contributed to a spike in egg and meat prices, and killed an alarming number of bald eagles and other wild birds. It also affected some zoos. It appeared to be waning in June, but officials warned then that another surge could take hold this fall. The disease is typically carried by migrating birds. It only occasionally affects humans, such as farm workers, and the USDA keeps poultry from infected flocks out of the food supply. A widespread outbreak in 2015 killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion.

{"id": "197", "fulltext": "Inflation is coming for Thanksgiving dinner. Turkey supplies have become stretched this year after an avian-influenza outbreak devastated flocks in the springtime and threatens to re-emerge in the fall, meat industry executives said. Reduced flocks have lifted turkey prices to record levels, analysts said, and price tags for the holiday staple are likely to remain high through Thanksgiving. The bird-flu outbreak has affected 39 states this year and has led to the death of more than 40 million birds, including roughly 6 million turkeys, according to the Agriculture Department—the second-deadliest outbreak on record. Newly confirmed cases in California and Minnesota have farmers and processors fearing a resurgence of the virus in the months ahead, analysts and executives said. Breast-meat prices for consumers have climbed above $6.50 a pound this year, compared with less than $2 a pound two years ago, according to market-research firm Urner Barry. Turkey hens—which represent the majority of birds served on Thanksgiving—currently cost 57% more than the five-year average, the firm estimated. Both prices represent all-time highs. Some of the biggest U.S. turkey suppliers said the virus has already cut into their supplies, pushing up prices. Hormel Foods Corp., the second-largest turkey processor by volume behind Butterball LLC, said on Thursday that sales volumes for its Jennie-O Turkey Store brand fell 20% year over year for the three months that ended July 31. For the current quarter, the company expects sales volumes to be 30% lower. Jacinth Smiley, Hormel's chief financial officer, said, 'Lower industrywide turkey supplies are expected to keep prices higher.' Hormel executives said on Thursday that recent cases have affected its turkey supply chain, and that the company expects reduced production volume through at least the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The combination of higher turkey-meat prices and limited supply helped boost Minnesota-based Hormel's quarterly profits from its turkey business, which increased by about $30 million from 2021 levels. Turkey supplies were tight before the bird-flu outbreak, following years of cutbacks by farmers responding to stagnant consumer demand and overproduction, said Russ Whitman, senior vice president at Urner Barry. Despite escalating prices, higher animal-feed costs are keeping turkey farmers from expanding their flocks, he said. The National Turkey Federation, a trade group for the industry, still expects there will be enough turkeys to go around for the coming holiday season. Supply-chain problems have contributed to sporadic shortages of turkey products in the short term, said Beth Breeding, a spokeswoman for the group. The tight turkey supply means some supermarkets might not get the exact quantity of 10-pound or 16-pound birds they ordered from their supplier for the holiday season, Urner Barry's Mr. Whitman said, and it is likely to be more expensive. 'Retailers are not getting what they want, they are getting what is available,' he said. Turkey production for the third quarter of this year is estimated to be down nearly 7%, or about 20 million pounds, compared with the same period a year ago, according to the USDA. Some farmers are trying to reduce the risk of bird-flu outbreaks by sending their turkeys to market earlier, and at lower weights than usual, according to analysts at agriculture lender CoBank. That has contributed to lower overall production, they said. Excessive heat this summer, which makes it harder for turkeys and chickens to gain weight, also tightened the turkey-meat supply, industry officials said. Cargill Inc., the third-largest turkey processor, hasn't been hit by the bird-flu outbreak as badly as others, said Tom Windish, president of Cargill's primary business division, which oversees turkey. The company this summer started getting more orders from retailers looking for suppliers with turkeys, he said. To help keep prices lower for consumers, Cargill is shipping more packages to retailers with less turkey in each one, Mr. Windish said. Cost-conscious customers may also opt for smaller turkeys this Thanksgiving to keep their spending down, he said. A 2015 avian-influenza outbreak, the deadliest on record—it led to the death of about 50 million birds—ended in the middle of that year, and turkey-industry officials have said they hoped the same would hold this year. Ms. Breeding, of the National Turkey Federation, said that in 2015 there were brief interruptions in the availability of some turkey items, but these were resolved before the holiday season. After months of declining cases among commercial poultry flocks, the USDA confirmed several outbreaks this past week in California, leading to the death of nearly 400,000 turkeys. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health also confirmed that a commercial turkey flock was culled this past week in response to a bird-flu case. The timing of the detection was sooner than anticipated, said Shauna Voss, senior state veterinarian in Minnesota. Entire poultry flocks are destroyed after an infection is confirmed to help limit the spread. Warm weather has slowed the spread of the virus in the past, but the recent cases in California suggest that this strain may be more resistant to heat, analysts said. Following the 2015 outbreak, the USDA upgraded its virus testing and detection systems, training and equipment, officials have said. Some farmers invested in new biosecurity systems for their barns meant to disinfect anyone who walks into the tightly sealed poultry houses so as not to track in wild-bird fecal matter. Despite the changes, farmers and USDA officials have struggled to halt this year's outbreak. 'All we can do is concentrate on our operations,' said Cargill's Mr. Windish.

{"id": "199", "fulltext": "The findings represent the first time a highly pathogenic form of the virus, which has devastated bird populations this year, has been detected in cetaceans. A bottlenose dolphin found dead in a Florida canal this past spring tested positive for a highly virulent strain of bird flu, scientists said on Wednesday. The announcement came a week after Swedish officials reported that they had found the same type of avian influenza in a stranded porpoise. This version of the virus, which has spread widely among North American and European birds, has affected an unusually broad array of species. But these findings represent the first two documented cases in cetaceans, a group of marine mammals that includes dolphins, porpoises and whales. It is too soon to say how commonly the virus infects cetaceans, but its discovery in two different species on two different continents suggests that there have 'almost certainly' been other cases, said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. 'Our surveillance activities on a global scale are never sensitive enough to pick up the only two events of this kind,' said Dr. Webby, who was not involved in the initial detection of the virus but is now working with the Florida team on follow-up studies. The virus has become so widespread in birds that it would not be surprising to see the pathogen pop up in other unexpected species, he said. 'Unfortunately, I think this is maybe just sort of a sign of what's to come should this virus not disappear,' he added. Experts emphasize that the risk to humans remains low. In the United States, the version of the virus that is circulating has caused just one documented human infection, in a person known to have had contact with poultry, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the spread of the virus to new species poses potential risks to wildlife and provides the virus with new chances to mutate and adapt to mammalian hosts. This strain of bird flu, known as Eurasian H5N1, has spread rapidly through domestic poultry, affecting tens of millions of farmed birds, according to the Agriculture Department. Compared to previous versions of the virus, this lineage has taken an especially heavy toll on wild bird populations, felling eagles, owls, pelicans and more. That, in turn, has put mammals that encounter wild birds at risk. As the outbreaks expanded this spring, the virus turned up in foxes, bobcats, skunks and other species. The virus has also been blamed for a spike in seal strandings in Maine, where bird flu has been detected in both gray and harbor seals. The Florida dolphin, a young male, was found in March in a canal in Dixie County, where area residents noticed that the animal had become trapped between the pilings of a pier and a sea wall, said Dr. Michael Walsh, a veterinarian at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine who leads the university's marine animal rescue program. By the time rescuers arrived, the dolphin had died, he said. The team, which routinely conducts necropsies, collected a variety of samples from the dolphin and stored them until they could be analyzed in more detail. At the time, the scientists had no reason to suspect that bird flu had made its way into dolphins, and they were not in a particular rush, said Dr. Walsh, who collaborated on the investigation with Dr. Robert Ossiboff, a veterinary pathologist, and Andrew Allison, a veterinary virologist, both at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine. When the results came back this summer, they revealed signs of inflammation in the dolphin's brain and the surrounding tissues, Dr. Walsh said. Scientists have previously documented brain inflammation in fox kits infected with the virus, which can cause neurological symptoms in birds and mammals. Subsequent laboratory testing turned up Eurasian H5N1 in the dolphin's brain and lungs. 'The brain tissue really showed a high level of virus,' Dr. Walsh said. Whether the virus contributed to the dolphin's death remains unknown, as does precisely how the animal contracted it. But it is not hard to imagine a young dolphin investigating an ailing bird near the shoreline, Dr. Walsh said, adding: 'These animals are always curious about their environment and checking things out. So if he came upon a sick, either dying or dead, bird, he might be very curious about it. He might mouth it.' The virus was also responsible for the death of a porpoise found stranded in Sweden in June, the Swedish National Veterinary Institute said last week. The pathogen was found in several of the animal's organs, including the brain, according to the agency. So far, there is no evidence that cetaceans are spreading the virus to one another, Dr. Webby said. And Dr. Webby's team, which has isolated and sequenced the virus detected in the Florida dolphin, has not found any signs that it has picked up mutations associated with adaptation to mammals. 'It still very much looks like a virus that you would pick up out of a bird,' he said. But now that dolphins and porpoises are known to be susceptible, researchers can begin to look for the virus more proactively, including in any tissue samples they previously collected. 'Now, everybody's going to be on guard for this,' Dr. Walsh said. 'And that'll help tell us how serious this really is for cetaceans on the coastlines.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 4}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 9}]}
{"id": "200", "fulltext": "Experts claim deadly spillovers of disease between livestock and wildlife are increasing with the growth in intensive methods Catastrophic declines in the number of birds and other wildlife are likely if countries do not act urgently to change the way animals are farmed, wildlife health scientists have warned. The unprecedented die-off of seabirds from highly pathogenic avian flu (HPAI) being witnessed in breeding colonies across Europe, North America and Africa has been traced back to a commercial goose farm in southern China where a relatively mild bird disease mutated into a killer in 1996. After spilling into wild bird populations in 2007, HPAI has spread around the world, killing millions of birds and showing no sign of stopping. Spillovers of disease between livestock and wildlife have increased as intensive farming has escalated to feed growing wealthier human populations demanding cheap meat. Over the past 50 years, the global population of poultry has multiplied six times, from 5.7 to nearly 36 billion; the number of pigs has almost doubled, from 547.2 to 952.6 million; and cattle numbers have grown from 1.1 to 1.5 billion. But the risk of spillovers and new pathogens emerging from larger herds and flocks of commercial animals has also grown as intensive livestock farming has been normalised. These large livestock populations, which are connected through trade, form reservoirs where infectious diseases can evolve and spill over into wildlife, occasionally with devastating consequences, wrote Thijs Kuiken, professor in the department of viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, and lead author of the editorial published this week in the journal Science. Kuiken goes on to describe the HPAI outbreak in seabirds as a warning, with devastating consequences if not heeded. Farm animals are increasingly passing disease to wildlife said co-author Ruth Cromie, councillor for wildlife health for the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. She highlights the spread of African swine fever across Europe and Asia through the trade of pigs and pig meat products, spilling over into wild boar and threatening endangered species of wild suids (pigs) in south-east Asia. Other spillovers mentioned by the authors included Mycoplasma gallisepticum bacteria from poultry to finches and other songbirds in North America. The authors argue that governments must protect wildlife from diseases linked to human activities. They propose reducing livestock herd sizes and densities on farms, limiting the transport of livestock from farm to farm, and restricting contacts between farmed animals and related wild species. In middle- and high-income countries, they say humans should move from animal- to plant-based proteins. Sam Sheppard, professor of microbial genomics and evolution at Oxford university, who was not involved in the editorial, said only a move away from intensive livestock farming would reduce disease risk. Because of the sheer size of these host niches with many millions of individual animals, viruses and bacteria inevitably spill over into the environment and into wild animal species. This can have serious consequences, as in the case of bird flu. However, this is only part of the problem. The larger the herd, [or group of animals] the larger the number of pathogens and the faster they evolve. Farms can reduce spillover with biosecurity, but that does not stop pathogens evolving.

{"id": "201", "fulltext": "UK's only large-scale supplier is understood to have suffered multiple outbreaks over the past week. Shoppers could face shortages of British goose this Christmas after the UK's biggest producer is understood to have been hit by multiple bird flu outbreaks. The UK has suffered what officials have said is the 'largest ever outbreak of avian flu' over the past year, with more than 140 reported outbreaks in England alone. The situation is particularly acute in Norfolk and Suffolk after 14 outbreaks in the past month alone. Suffolk-based Gressingham Foods, which raises ducks, geese and seasonal turkeys, has been hit particularly hard, according to industry insiders, after five outbreaks on its sites across the two counties in the past week. Thousands of birds are understood to have been culled. As the main supplier to UK supermarkets, there are fears the availability of British goose this Christmas will be severely affected, with about 250,000 geese eaten over the festive period. Goose is normally made available to buy by retailers from late October. Although there are farmgate options for the public to seek out goose for Christmas, retailers are likely to have to look at imports, said Richard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council (BPC). There are other UK-based duck producers, but Gressingham Foods is the UK's only year-round supplier of duck meat. Gressingham Foods did not respond to requests for comment, but UK supermarkets downplayed any concerns about duck or goose meat availability. 'Retailers are well versed at managing supply chains under challenging conditions. They are monitoring the continuing spread of avian flu and have asked the government to take all appropriate steps to reduce its spread to ensure continued supply for customers,' said Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium. Avian flu is probably carried by migrating birds, spreading through direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear. In the event of a confirmed outbreak, any surviving birds in a flock are culled, with farmers compensated for the healthy birds. Across Europe as a whole, 47.7 million birds have been culled since last autumn and many more thousands of wild birds have died. More than 100,000 ducks were reportedly culled at farms owned by Gressingham Foods earlier this year during previous outbreaks of bird flu. The situation is likely to worsen as autumn migration begins and the number of wild birds wintering in Europe increases the risk of outbreaks. In previous years cases dropped in the summer, but this year outbreaks continued with experts suspecting highly pathogenic variants of avian flu are now endemic in wild birds, creating a risk of infection all year. The British Poultry Council has called for a UK-wide compulsory housing order for all farmed birds 'as soon as possible to prioritise the wellbeing of our farmers, the viability of their businesses and the safety of all birds.' Veterinary trials to test bird flu vaccines have started in France and the Netherlands, but there are question marks around the effectiveness of vaccinations against avian flu and whether vaccinated birds can still spread the disease if infected.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 2}, {"key": "deny_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "UK supermarkets downplayed any concerns about duck or goose meat availability."}, {"key": "deny_evolve_statement_1", "statement": "UK supermarkets downplayed any concerns about duck or goose meat availability."}]}

{"id": "203", "fulltext": "When a highly contagious strain of avian influenza began racing across the United States this spring, the Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota prepared for an influx of ailing birds. 'But we never could have anticipated the flood of patients that arrived,' said Dr. Victoria Hall, executive director of the center, which provides medical care for birds of prey. From late March to early June of this year, Dr. Hall and her colleagues saw more than 180 flu-afflicted birds, including scores of great horned owls, red-tailed hawks and bald eagles. Many were severely ill, suffering from seizures or unable to see or stand. Caring for these animals—just one of which survived—was emotional, draining work that required long hours in personal protective equipment, including Tyvek suits and respirators. So it came as an immense relief when cases tailed off this summer, falling to just one in July and zero in August. But in September, the sick raptors returned. Last month, the center had 11 confirmed cases of the avian flu, Dr. Hall said: 'It's definitely coming back through.' This year's avian influenza outbreak is the worst the United States has experienced since 2015, the last time the country was hit hard by bird flu. So far, the virus has affected 47 million farmed birds, nearly the same number as in the 2014-15 season. But by all other measures, this year's outbreak is 'radically different than what we've seen before,' said Bryan Richards, the emerging disease coordinator at the National Wildlife Health Center, which is part of the U.S. Geological Survey. This year's is more wide-ranging, spreading to almost every state, and is having a much greater effect on wild birds, infecting more than 100 species in North America, according to Mr. Richards. (The virus currently poses little risk to humans, experts say.) And, unlike in 2015, the virus did not fizzle out over the summer. Instead, it continued to circulate in wild birds, many of which spend their summers in the Arctic. Now, as wild birds fly south for the winter, they are bringing the virus with them. Cases are climbing again in a number of northern states and popping up for the first time in some southern ones, such as Mississippi, Arkansas and New Mexico. Poultry farms are familiar with the risks of avian influenza, but for many zoos, rehabilitation centers and facilities that house wild birds, it is a formidable new threat. They are bracing themselves for a resurgence—and wondering whether the virus is here to stay. 'We'll just have to be on alert,' said Dr. Trevor Zachariah, the director of veterinary programs at Florida's Brevard Zoo, where infected wild vultures keep finding their way onto the property. 'We may have to live with this.' Spring surge Avian influenza wings its way around the world in the bodies of migrating birds, especially in water birds such as ducks, geese and gulls. Some of these birds, which can carry the virus without showing symptoms, share summer habitats in the Arctic, where they may swap pathogens, picking up new flu strains. 'It's like bringing the kids to day care from different suburbs,' said Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. 'As they commingle, that's where the virus moves around on a global scale.' As infected birds migrate, they shed the virus in their feces, mucus and saliva, seeding infections in flocks of farmed fowl, in which some flu strains can be fatal. The current outbreak began in late 2021, when a highly pathogenic strain of flu known as Eurasian H5N1 was detected in birds in Eastern Canada. The virus made its way down the Atlantic coast to Florida and then exploded this spring, when migrating birds carried the pathogen north and west. Along the way, it not only infiltrated hundreds of commercial flocks but also began felling wild birds, taking out entire families of owls and triggering die-offs of geese and gulls. 'We've never seen anything like this before,' said Ashton Kluttz, the executive director of the Bird Rescue Center in Sonoma County, Calif., which created extra makeshift hospitals to handle the patient load. (The virus also found its way into mammals, from foxes to seals.) Scientists are not yet certain why the virus is taking such a high toll on wild birds this year. It may be that the virus has changed to become more contagious among wild species or better adapted to them. A cold, wet spring might also have given the virus more opportunity to take hold in wild populations, Dr. Poulsen said. Rehabilitation centers, sanctuaries and zoos have scrambled to put new precautions in place, moving vulnerable birds inside and suspending public programs. After Tri-State Bird Rescue & Research, in Delaware, identified its first case in February—triggering a three-week quarantine—it adopted new disinfection protocols and stopped accepting waterfowl from other rehabilitation centers. 'We have—fortunately, knock wood—not had an outbreak at our center,' said Lisa Smith, the rescue's executive director. But, she added, 'We know the virus is still out there.' Fall flights Cases ebbed in many places this summer, but the virus never completely disappeared. Now, it's on the move. Blue-winged teal, a type of duck, are among the first species to fly south in the fall. In mid-September, three hunter-harvested teal tested positive for the virus in Mississippi, marking the first detections in that state. The finding affirms that, 'Yes, the virus persisted in northern latitudes through the summer,' Mr. Richards said. 'And it's coming back on the wings of wild waterfowl.' Wisconsin began to see a spike in wild bird infections around Labor Day, Dr. Poulsen said, and recently documented its first poultry outbreaks since May. 'We were really hoping that we were out of the woods,' he said. The virus appears to be making a comeback in other northern regions, including Minnesota, North Dakota and Alberta, Canada. So far, experts have said, the surge has been smaller than it was in the spring. 'But there's lots more geese and ducks to come down out of the Arctic,' said Margo Pybus, a provincial wildlife disease specialist at Alberta's Fish and Wildlife Division. Farther south, wildlife facilities are preparing for a flood of fall migrants. Southern California was spared in the spring, but Dr. Hendrik Nollens, the vice president of wildlife health at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, does not expect to be so lucky this fall. The San Diego Zoo and its sister facility, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, covered their outdoor aviaries and removed food and water sources that might attract avian interlopers, even going so far as to drain a pond popular with wild ducks. They also moved 900 birds into more protected habitats—a herculean effort that involved relocating hundreds of flamingos, Dr. Nollens said. To pull off the feat, employees guided many of the flamingos into enclosed trailers, which delivered the animals to covered or indoor habitats. Staff members modified these new spaces to suit the leggy wading birds, adding feeding pools, trimming low-hanging tree branches and raising the sprinklers designed to keep their feathers in fine fettle. When the flamingos will return home is unclear. 'When do we stop doing these things is actually a tough challenge,' Dr. Nollens said. 'We don't know what's going to happen from here.' The long haul The signs from Europe, where the outbreaks began earlier than they did in North America, were not encouraging. There, the virus has persisted through multiple migration cycles, fueling 'the largest avian flu epidemic ever observed on the continent,' according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Although the scope and scale of future outbreaks is hard to predict, scientists said that they expected the virus to persist through the winter, then to travel north again in the spring. 'I don't see any reason to suggest this is going to go away anytime soon,' Mr. Richards said. And if the virus does stick around? 'It is going to have huge implications for anybody with either permanently captive or transitory captive wildlife in their care,' Dr. Hall said. The Raptor Center plans to continue testing all incoming patients for the virus indefinitely and is considering building a more permanent triage and quarantine area, she added. In California, the Bird Rescue Center recently decided to add an avian influenza unit to its new facility, which is not slated to open until at least late 2023. The Oregon Zoo, which moved many of its birds indoors in August, does not want to keep the animals cooped up for long. 'It's just not good welfare,' said Dr. Carlos Sanchez, the zoo's head veterinarian. 'They need the space to move. They need the sun.' So employees are working to reopen aviaries with new precautions in place, such as foot baths where visitors can disinfect their shoes. In the long run, managing the risks may require facilities to be watchful and nimble, tightening and loosening precautions as outbreaks flare and fade. At the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium, for instance, employees will return to wearing full P.P.E., as they did this spring, if the virus is reported in the surrounding county, said Dr. Justin Rosenberg, an associate veterinarian at the zoo. After the spring surge, combined with more than two years of coronavirus-related precautions, there is definite 'preparedness fatigue,' Dr. Rosenberg acknowledged. But the zoo is eager to protect its avian charges, which include flamingos, ostriches and a 3-year-old duck with 'one of the best names that I have encountered,' Dr. Rosenberg said.

{"id": "204", "fulltext": "Chicken and egg producers call for housing order for poultry and captive birds to be extended across UK Poultry farmers have called for a UK-wide housing order to be brought in as soon as possible, after an upsurge in bird flu outbreaks in the past month. A compulsory housing order for all poultry and captive birds in Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of Essex came into force on Wednesday. It applies to everyone who keeps birds—both commercial flock keepers and non-commercial premises such as back yards, hobby flocks or pets. It comes after a significant increase in bird flu cases in the east of England region, with 27 outbreaks in the past month alone across the three counties. Christmas goose producers are among those to have been badly affected. The UK’s chief vet, Christine Middlemiss, said she expected to see the number of bird flu cases on farms to continue to rise over the coming months as migratory birds return to the UK. In the past month there have also been outbreaks in Somerset, Oxford, Staffordshire, North Yorkshire, Lancashire, Devon and Cheshire. In November last year, the chief veterinary officers for Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland agreed to bring in a compulsory housing order across the UK. This was only lifted by the chief vets from the four devolved nations in May this year. Farming groups are calling on for the new regional compulsory housing order to be extended across the whole of the UK as soon as possible. The sheer persistence of avian influenza over the past year, coupled with soaring energy and feed costs, has put the whole British poultry sector under huge emotional and financial pressure. Given the recent rise in avian influenza cases and the distress they cause for farming families, the implementation of housing measures in the east of England is a necessary step. The number one priority for poultry farmers has always been the health and welfare of their flock. That is why the National Farmers Union is now urging the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to consider expanding the regional housing measures on a national basis to reflect any increase in the levels of risk across the country,” said NFU poultry board chair James Mottershead. The British Poultry Council said a compulsory housing order for all farmed birds was necessary as soon as possible to prioritise the wellbeing of our farmers, the viability of their businesses and the safety of all birds. UK egg producers also said they would like to see the initial compulsory housing order extended across the UK. Free-range egg producers said their support was conditional on the UK aligning with EU proposals to allow eggs to continue to be labelled as “free range,” even if the birds are not allowed outside. The European Commission has put forward plans for scrapping the time limit on the marketing of eggs as free range if chickens are forced to be housed to reduce the risk of outbreaks of bird flu. Over the last year, the UK has faced its largest ever outbreak of bird flu with more than 160 cases confirmed since late October 2021. “We’ve been seeing unprecedented levels of the virus around the UK this year, and usually numbers increase as winter approaches, so the situation could get even worse,” said Prof Wendy Barclay, head of the department of infectious disease at Imperial College London. “The outbreak is being closely monitored by the Animal and Plant Health Agency and Defra, but it is clear that farmed birds that are exposed to wild birds are vulnerable,” she added. Defra said any decision on when to reintroduce national housing measures would be based on the latest scientific and ornithological evidence and veterinary advice. The UK Health Security Agency continue to advise the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency advice remains unchanged, that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers.

The presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 was confirmed by Wales' interim chief veterinary officer, Gavin Watkins, at the site. It is the first confirmed case of avian influenza in Wales since 1 October. UK health agencies have advised that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and food standards agencies have said bird flu poses a very low food safety risk. A 3km protection zone and 10km surveillance zone have been declared around the infected premises to limit the risk of the disease spreading, the Welsh government said. It added that bird movements and gatherings are restricted within these zones and all holdings that keep birds must be declared. Bird keepers have been urged to remain vigilant and ensure they have high levels of biosecurity in place. Farmers are advised to consult a vet in the first instance if birds become unwell and if avian influenza is suspected it must legally be reported to the Animal and Plant Health Agency.

{"id": "206", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium has closed several exhibits and taken other precautions after one of its pelicans died from the bird flu. The zoo said one of its pink-backed pelicans that died on Thursday tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza. A second pelican became ill Friday and was euthanized. As a precaution, the zoo has closed its Lied Jungle, Desert Dome and Simmons Aviary exhibits to the public for at least 10 days. The Omaha zoo was one of many across the country that closed down its aviaries and moved birds inside whenever possible to help protect them from avian influenza that is primarily spread by the droppings of wild birds. The zoo reopened its aviary in June after bird flu cases waned, but some cases continued to be reported across the country throughout the summer, and the outbreak has started to make a resurgence this fall. More than 47 million chickens and turkeys have been slaughtered in 42 states to limit the spread of bird flu during this year's outbreak. Officials order entire flocks to be killed when the virus is found on farms. More than 6 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered last month to limit the spread of the disease. The Omaha zoo also took precautions to protect its birds by limiting staff access to them and requiring workers to clean their shoes before entering areas where the birds are kept. The zoo said its pelicans live outside, so they do come into contact with wild birds. But the pelicans don't come into contact with other zoo birds and no other birds in the zoo's collection have shown symptoms of bird flu. \"It is very important that Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium immediately tighten our protocols to protect our birds and guard against any potential spread of avian influenza,\" Sarah Woodhouse, the zoo's director of animal health, said in a statement. \"This is important both to prevent infection of other zoo birds, and to prevent the virus from being dispersed off zoo grounds.\" Unlike on farms, zoos are generally allowed to isolate and treat an infected bird as long as they take precautions to protect the other birds in their collections. Health officials emphasize that bird flu doesn't jeopardize food safety because infected birds aren't allowed into the food supply and properly cooking meat and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.

{"id": "208", "fulltext": "Emmanuel the emu, who went viral on TikTok for hilariously pecking his owner's phone as she filmed educational videos about farming, is fighting for his life amid a deadly outbreak of avian influenza that has killed most of the birds on the farm where he lives, his owner said. Emmanuel is experiencing nerve damage in his right leg and can't eat or drink on his own after contracting the disease on Wednesday, content creator and hobby farmer Taylor Blake shared late Saturday on social media. Blake, whose family owns Knuckle Bump Farms in South Florida, said the farm lost more than 50 birds in three days, all but Emmanuel and Rico the swan. Emmanuel, the roughly 5-foot-8, 120-pound emu, whom The Washington Post interviewed in July, faces 'a long road ahead' to recovery, Blake said. But he is a 'fighter,' she added. The United States is in the midst of a months-long avian influenza outbreak that experts have said is the most severe since 2015, when a 'highly pathogenic' strain of the disease affected more than 49 million birds. The Department of Agriculture called it 'the most costly animal health emergency' in its history. Blake said she suspects the outbreak of avian influenza at the farm was spread by throngs of wild Egyptian geese, a type of aquatic bird known as waterfowl, who routinely fly in 'under the cover of darkness.' She said she believes they spread the disease among the domesticated birds there. 'The virus hit them extremely hard and very quickly,' Blake wrote on Twitter as she described the extent of her family farm's loss: 'Every single' chicken, duck, goose, female black swan and turkey at the farm died in just three days. Emmanuel's videos have reached millions of people on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter. Blake and a puppet of Emmanuel were featured on 'The Tonight Show' with Jimmy Fallon in July, and Knuckle Bump Farms began to sell merchandise with the emu's face on it. Now, Blake wants to use what happened to her farm to raise awareness about the disease. She said she is 'dedicated' to ensuring that Emmanuel survives it, describing a sling she and girlfriend Kristian Haggerty built so the emu could 'start physical therapy.' In a video posted late Saturday, Emmanuel appeared alert, at one point looking straight into the camera as Blake showered kisses on his head. Avian influenza is a viral disease that typically spreads from wild birds to domesticated birds through bodily fluids, including saliva and feces. In its highly pathogenic form, it is extremely infectious and deadly and cannot be treated. The virus affects birds differently: Some are simply found dead with no signs of illness, while in others, it can lead to neurological damage, including seizures, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. While experts say the risk of it spreading from birds to humans is low, it can happen and can cause severe illness or death. In April, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that a person in Colorado involved 'in the culling (depopulating) of poultry with presumptive H5N1 bird flu' had tested positive for the virus, experienced symptoms and then recovered. It said the health risk to the general population remains low. The current outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza began in January 2022 in Canada and is believed to have spread from Europe. Wild birds migrating to the United States are thought to have brought the virus to dozens of states, including, for the first time, Florida, where the outbreak has been 'unprecedented,' the commission said. Blake said Saturday that she had been in contact with Florida officials, who she said told her that standing water left behind by Hurricane Ian, which battered the state in late September, had 'made the virus run rampant.' Florida wildlife officials could not be immediately reached for comment early Sunday. Various studies have shown that the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza spreading increases with proximity to contaminated bodies of water. In a previous interview with The Post, Blake described how she began posting videos with the animals at Knuckle Bump Farms in 2018 to entertain and educate people about farm life. The first time Emmanuel interrupted her as she was filming a video on the farm, Blake was irritated and didn't post it. About a month later, she was re-watching the video on her phone and thought the interruption was funny. 'I just posted it, not thinking anything of it,' she said at the time. It 'completely spiraled from there.' Blake said Emmanuel has a genuine 'obsession with the camera' and with her. 'No matter where I am, he always has to be right next to me.' Soon after Blake posted about Emmanuel's condition on Twitter, messages of support began to pour in from well-wishers who have grown to love Emmanuel and his relentless pursuit of his owner's cellphone. 'DONT YOU DARE DO IT Emmanuel Todd Lopez. You are the king of birds and YOU WILL SURVIVE!!!,' one said, using Emmanuel's full name and echoing Blake's standard rebuke for the rebel bird. 'We love you Emmanuel! You were put on this earth to bring joy to the world,' one wrote.

Scientists believe wild migratory birds brought the virus to North America at the beginning of the year and have spread the virus to more than 40 wild bird species. While chickens and turkeys with the virus quickly die, some waterfowl with the virus can remain healthy and carry it long distances. The flu strain historically has posed almost no risk to humans, but public experts remain concerned about the possibility that it could jump across species. \"Because humans have no prior immunity to these viruses typically, if they were to be infected and spread the virus to other humans, then we could have another pandemic virus on our hands,\" Todd Davis, an expert on animal-to-human diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told NPR earlier this year. The United Kingdom is also dealing with a bird flu outbreak—its largest ever—and declared an Aviation Influenza Prevention Zone on Monday, requiring bird keepers in Great Britain to follow strict biosecurity measures.

Three other emus, named Elliot, Eliza and Emily, also died. 'The virus hit them extremely hard and very quickly,' she tweeted. 'I tried my best to save them, but I was unsuccessful.' Avian flu, also known as bird flu, can be spread by wild birds that show no signs of illness, according to the Agriculture Department. As they migrate, they can infect domestic birds in backyards and farms. More than 530 flocks in 42 states are confirmed to have had avian flu this year, according to the USDA. The virus has a mortality rate of more than 90% in chickens, often killing them within 48 hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Humans aren't typically infected with avian flu, though there have been rare cases of human infection, the CDC says.

{"id": "213", "fulltext": "LONDON (AP) British authorities said Monday that all poultry and other captive birds in England must be kept indoors from next week after bird flu was detected in dozens of farms across the country, as well as in wild birds. The U.K. is facing its worst ever outbreak of avian influenza, with over 200 cases confirmed since October 2021 and millions of birds culled. The mandatory measures, which come into force on Nov. 7, legally require all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity rules to protect their birds, whether pets, commercial farm poultry or just a few birds in a backyard. We are now facing this year the largest ever outbreak of bird flu and are seeing rapid escalation in the number of cases on commercial farms and in backyard birds across England,\" the U.K.'s chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said in a statement. \"The risk of kept birds being exposed to disease has reached a point where it is now necessary for all birds to be housed until further notice,\" she added. The measures were already in force since late September in areas including Suffolk and Norfolk in eastern England. Authorities say the risk to public health from the virus remains very low. But the outbreak has led to concerns about the supply of turkeys for the Christmas season.

{"id": "214", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Iowa agriculture officials said Monday that another commercial egg farm in the state has been infected with bird flu, the first commercial farm case identified since April, when a turkey farm was infected. The latest case is in Wright County in north central Iowa about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Des Moines housing about 1.1 million chickens. Iowa has had 15 commercial farms infected this year, including turkeys, egg-laying hens and other chickens. In addition, five backyard flocks have been infected. Because the virus is highly contagious, all birds on an infected farm are killed and disposed of to avoid the spread of the disease. Iowa has been hardest hit with bird losses at more than 13.3 million this year before the latest farm was found infected. Nationally more than 47.7 million birds have been affected in 43 states that includes 251 commercial flocks and 328 backyard flocks, U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show. Most of the Iowa cases were during the spring migration of wild birds in March and April with one reported in early May. The virus hadn't been detected again until a backyard flock was infected on Oct. 20 and then the latest infection was confirmed on Monday. Federal and state agriculture officials had been concerned that it could return with the fall migration of wild birds, which often carry the virus but aren't sickened by it. The virus can spread through droppings or the nasal discharge of an infected bird, which can contaminate dust and soil. \"We have been preparing for the possibility of additional outbreaks and are working closely with USDA and producers to eradicate this disease from our state,\" said Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig. \"With migration ongoing, we continue to emphasize the need for strict biosecurity on poultry farms and around backyard flocks to help prevent and limit the spread of this destructive virus.\" Eds: UPDATES: Links audio.

It's the second case of highly pathogenic avian influenza this fall, likely sparked by millions of migrating birds that can carry the deadly virus. Earlier this month, officials reported a positive test in a Dallas County backyard flock with 48 birds. It was the first reported outbreak in Iowa since May 2. Avian influenza continues to be a significant threat across the country, said Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig in a statement.

{"id": "217", "fulltext": "Reduced flock sizes and rising costs put pressure on supplies but retailers say they are working to minimise impact. British egg producers are warning of possible shortages, as farmers leave the industry or reduce the size of their flocks in the face of spiralling costs and uncertainty sparked by the spread of bird flu. A third of farmers surveyed in recent days by the trade body the British Free Range Egg Producers Association (BFREPA) reported they had reduced the number of hens in their flock because egg prices meant they were unable to cover their costs. Meanwhile, a quarter of the 165 farmers who responded told the BFREPA they had stopped production either temporarily or permanently. Farmers have been grappling with soaring costs, including the price of feed for their hens, as well as higher energy and transport bills. The association represents about 550 egg businesses, who account for about 70% of the UK's free range and organic egg production, supplying the country's largest retailers. Several of those surveyed who had reduced their flock said they were 'seriously considering not restocking' while another farmer added 'trying to cut costs to survive.' In March, the egg industry called on the UK's big retailers to increase the price of a dozen eggs by 40p to prevent the collapse of hundreds of egg producers. The BFREPA said the average price of eggs had since increased by about 45p, but only a quarter of that 'between 9p and 10p' had been passed on to farmers, which was not enough to cover their higher costs. The egg industry body, the British Egg Industry Council, said cost pressures had led to a temporary reduction in the size of the British flock, but it expected numbers to increase again as cost pressures ease. It said the pressure on egg supply had been caused by several factors: 'These include hens lost as a result of avian flu; cost of production rises, which mean that producers are struggling to break even; a reduction in the number of colony hens as retailers move towards cage free; and strong demand from consumers.' The council added the industry was working closely with retailers to ensure that producers can meet consumer demand. The Guardian understands that supermarkets are not facing immediate egg shortages. Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers were managing their supply chains and continuing to 'work hard to ensure minimal impact to customers despite ongoing supply chain pressures.' The cost pressures come as producers are coping with the UK's largest-ever outbreak of avian influenza, raising concerns about reduced output. Keeping hens indoors also leads to additional costs for farmers. The outbreak, which has been running for more than a year, has accelerated in recent weeks, with nearly 100 confirmed cases of bird flu H5N1 since the start of October. Officials have said the disease circulates among wild birds, but it is deadly for captive birds including hens and turkeys. Any outbreak is also devastating for farmers as it prompts a cull of any remaining birds on site. In an attempt to curb the spread of avian influenza, poultry and other captive birds in England are required by law to be housed indoors for an indefinite period. A prolonged housing order may also lead to free range eggs having to be relabelled for sale. UK law states that eggs can still be marketed as free range for the first 16 weeks of a housing order; if the hens are still required to be kept indoors after that time, the eggs will need to be relabelled as 'barn eggs.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 4}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 2}]}
{"id": "218", "fulltext": "Scrambled tofu, chickpea meringues and sweet potato cakes are healthier and cheaper substitutes UK supermarkets have declared an egg crisis as a result of avian flu and the summer heatwave, but those who want their regular fix of eggy options don't have to suffer. The solutions that supermarkets have mooted so far include egg rationing and higher prices, but there is another alternative that vegan chefs have been recommending for years: plant-based substitutes. Eggs are an important ingredient because they serve multiple purposes in cooking and baking. They provide richness, structure and texture, as well as emulsifying and binding. They're also a good source of protein and vitamins. There are lots of effective substitutes that can enable consumers to avoid the egg shortage, as well as providing health benefits, reducing carbon emissions and eliminating the negative impact on animal welfare of industrial farming. Alexis Gauthier, who runs Michelin-starred vegan restaurant Gauthier Soho, says in classical French cooking, egg use is split into whites and yolks. Egg whites, which are high protein and react easily to heat, are used for binding ingredients together and setting, while yolks are high in fat and cholesterol so they add creamy smooth richness to dishes. Here are the egg swaps the chefs recommend. Breakfast One of the best known replacements for eggs in vegan cooking is the tofu scramble, which has a similar texture to scrambled egg, although it is usually mixed with spices to boost flavour. At Gauthier's casual restaurant 123V, he uses silken tofu to recreate scrambled eggs, adding turmeric for colour and kala namak, a black Himalayan salt readily available in south Asian supermarkets which has a subtle sulphurous aroma that resembles the taste of egg. Roxy Pope, co-founder of So Vegan, says tofu is a fantastic source of protein and calcium while fortified plant-based milks can be added to create a runnier texture and incorporate vitamin B12. Bettina Campolucci Bordi, a plant-based chef, says you can also experiment with texture by choosing silken or firm tofu. She recommends trying a chickpea scramble by squishing half a tin of chickpeas and leaving the remainder whole for texture, and cooking up with vegetables and a tomato sauce. In the mornings, she also makes a chickpea omelette out of gram flour, bicarbonate of soda and apple cider vinegar, served with seasonal vegetables quick, easy and much cheaper than eggs. Burgers, patties and fritters These dishes all use egg as a binder to stop the ingredients falling apart when they're being fried. The chefs recommend instead using a flax egg which is made of ground flaxseeds soaked in water until they become gelatinous. Ben Pook, co-founder of So Vegan, suggests combining this with oats and chickpea flour, which soak up moisture and prevent patties falling apart. Flaxseeds are also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which improve heart health. Cakes and baking Eggs make cakes taste rich and moist, but there are lots of hacks vegan bakers use that you can try. Valentina Fois, who runs Lele's vegan food consultancy, uses a ripe banana or chia seeds in her cakes, while Campolucci Bordi says any puree will work, including sweet potato, carrot or apple. Adding a dash of apple cider vinegar will make baked goods fluffier. Aquafaba, the juice from a tin of chickpeas, is commonly used as an alternative to egg whites, although results can differ. Pope uses them for meringues, but warns they won't stay as crispy for long, so should be eaten quickly. Food influencer Samah Lakha makes a chocolate mousse using aquafaba instead of egg whites, although she says it is a better substitute for texture than taste. Coconut milk, cashew butter and vanilla combined with maple syrup for sweetness will help dial up the richness, and can make an effective vegan custard thanks to the ingredients' high fat content, she adds. Fine dining If you want to experiment with fine dining techniques, Gauthier uses potato protein to recreate egg white he recommends Sosa's products in dishes such as macaroons. Instead of egg yolks, he uses pea protein bought from Yumgo in combination with rapeseed oil and rice flour to create curds, shortbreads and creamy sauces.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 1}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "UK supermarkets have declared an egg crisis as a result of avian flu and the summer heatwave"}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 0}]}
{"id": "219", "fulltext": "If the H5N1 virus jumps into the human population and more dangerous strains emerge, it could set off a new pandemic. Lockdowns are a horrible experience, but fortunately one that is in the past now. Unless, that is, you're a domestic bird in Britain. Since 7 November, a UK directive has instructed all farmers to keep their birds indoors as part of a stringent measure to stop the spread of avian flu, or the H5N1 virus. This measure is intended to avoid infection of domestic birds from wild birds, and will result in tens of millions of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys being brought inside for the foreseeable future. We've also seen island birds affected, resulting in the shutdown of human visitors to the Isle of May in Scotland for five weeks, among other measures. Avian flu is known as one of the most infectious diseases: the R number, which was often discussed for the spread of Covid-19, can be as high as 100 for avian flu, meaning one bird can infect as many as 100 others. And the past few months have seen exponential spread of the virus, with Britain and Europe hit especially hard. A lab in Surrey that tests samples says it has seen a 600% increase in cases in the past three months. Why is this outbreak causing concern not just among scientists but also poultry farmers and government officials? Currently, avian flu outbreaks have been limited in humans because the virus doesn't spread easily between us. But this is a ticking timebomb. A mutation that makes this virus circulate more easily between humans is possible. This would be a gamechanger and raise the risk to humans considerably. And the more chances the virus has to jump into a human and mutate, the more likely it is a dangerous strain will emerge that could set off the next pandemic. While humans have been infected by birds, they are usually workers on poultry farms and those in close contact with infected birds, and even these instances have been rare. For example, on 3 November, two farm workers in Spain tested positive; it was the second known infection of humans in Europe since 2003. Infection is usually through handling sick or dead birds. Infected birds have the flu virus in their saliva, blood, mucus and faeces, and humans can get infected if they get this virus into the eyes, nose or mouth, or inhale droplets in close range (you can't get infected with avian flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs). And this virus is not mild. The fatality rate is thought to be high in humans: the World Health Organization estimate is roughly 60% for H5N1. We currently have no vaccine to use in humans; nor does the seasonal flu vaccine work against avian flu. But while the chance of human transmission is a future worry, right now the virus is affecting people's livelihoods and farms, and putting hundreds of millions of domestic and wild birds in danger. Outbreaks in chickens can kill the entire local population; in other birds, such as ducks and geese, the disease is often mild or even asymptomatic. Ducks have even been called the 'Trojan horses' for the virus, given their ability to carry it and infect others while remaining unaffected themselves. Bird flu is highly infectious and poses a high risk to chickens and turkeys. As a result, if a farm tests positive for bird flu, the entire flock is culled. This can lead to hundreds of thousands to millions of pounds in lost income, and places enormous strain on poultry farms. It also has implications for the price and availability of turkeys and chickens going into Thanksgiving and Christmas. And, of course, it is a tremendous loss of bird life. The heart of the issue is how we raise and treat animals, and their interactions with humans. Poultry are often kept in difficult conditions where they are packed into close quarters and diseases easily pass through them. Some experts think that this more infectious strain developed in an industrial factory environment, where animals are kept in close quarters and viruses have the chance to circulate and mutate. And this is not just an issue with avian flu, but other infectious diseases as well. In places such as China and India, antibiotics are freely given to animals in order to prevent infection (especially in industrial farming) and to make them as large as possible. A survey of chicken farmers in China found that they all used antibiotics. The rationale here is cheap and fast meat to meet the growing demand in emerging economies. But this creates its own problems. Feeding antibiotics to animals can lead to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, and then humans such as farmers becoming infected with antibiotic-resistant infections. These then circulate in humans and reduce the effectiveness of one of the most powerful drugs in modern medicine. Chemotherapy, infections and surgeries of all kinds have become safer because of antibiotics. If the drugs don't work, these procedures become high-risk and life-threatening, as they used to be in the pre-antibiotic era. And as we've learned, all it takes is for a person to get on a plane with a novel infectious disease for it soon to become a problem for everywhere else in the world. The major infectious disease threats in humans tend to come from animals: think of Sars-CoV-2, Sars, Mers, Ebola — the list goes on. There are more than a million viruses circulating in the animal kingdom, and it would be a fool's errand to try to stop that circulation. But we can limit the chances these have to jump into the human population, and limit their circulation in domestic animals. This requires taking the animal-human interface seriously, and knowing that while it's a major economic, animal welfare and farming problem now, the situation becoming even worse is just a mutation away. * Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 20}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "A mutation that makes this virus circulate more easily between humans is possible.

{"id": "220", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — An Iowa agriculture official on Thursday limited the movement of live birds in the state as a response to a return of bird flu with the fall migration of wild birds.

The order is effective for at least 30 days and will be in effect until 30 days have passed without a positive confirmation of bird flu in Iowa.

{"id": "221", "fulltext": "Hard-hit producers who have lost tens of thousands of pounds after culling stock now fear they may not be able to continue. It is eerily silent on Steve Childerhouse's poultry farm near Attleborough in Norfolk. At this time of year, he'd usually be working flat out, feeding his turkeys and geese for the busy Christmas period. But this year the sheds are empty, after avian influenza hit his farm in late September, wiping out all of his 11,000 free-range turkeys and 2,500 geese destined for local festive dinner tables. In one fell swoop, a bird flu outbreak has devastated the 51-year-old's livelihood. After almost 40 years—he started raising geese as a boy—Childerhouse is still coming to terms with the loss. 'I wouldn't wish it on anybody,' he says, recalling how quickly the infection spread through his flock. He believes the disease was brought to his farm by wild birds, who initially passed it on to his geese. The highly infectious bird flu that has been sweeping across Britain for more than a year now, and gained pace in recent weeks, is deadly for farmed animals such as turkeys and geese. However, any outbreak is also catastrophic for the farmers, as any remaining birds on the site have to be culled. At present the disease doesn't pass easily from birds to humans. 'I've never seen anything like it and I don't want to see it ever again,' Childerhouse says. 'We had taken these birds from day-old chicks.' He is reeling not just from the financial hit, but from the emotional rollercoaster of dealing with bird flu, which he likens to grief. After the cull, he had to inform all the local butchers and farm shops that usually sell his birds, and warn all of his regular workers that he would not be able to offer them much-needed seasonal jobs this year. It's the Covid of poultry, except that turkeys and other poultry don't get sick and recover; they just die. Paul Kelly, farmer Childerhouse has already decided he won't go back into rearing geese, and in the meantime is looking for work elsewhere. The UK's worst-ever outbreak of bird flu has prompted fears about the availability of British turkeys and geese this Christmas. The newly appointed farming minister, Mark Spencer, told the Observer it would be 'quite a challenge' for consumers to get hold of a British goose 'because there's been such devastation in the sector.' He insisted, however, that there should be enough turkeys to go around, thanks to robust supply chains. Nearly 9 million turkeys are eaten in the UK each Christmas, of which about 90% are British, according to the British Poultry Council. The sector relies on seasonal supply to rear, slaughter and process birds in time for all of those festive meals. The industry body says the free-range sector has taken the biggest hit from bird flu, with about 35% of producers—which between them rear more than a million birds each year—directly affected. There have been 100 confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in England since the start of October. The outbreak has now been running for more than a year, since October 2021, and in that time there have been more than 230 cases. It has led, so far, to the culling of 3.5m birds on UK farms and piled pressure on Britain's egg producers, at a time when soaring energy and feed costs are causing many to leave the sector. Bird flu cases usually drop during the summer months, but that did not happen this year. The disease has been most acute in East Anglia, especially Childerhouse's home county of Norfolk. It is currently spreading northwards and westwards, with several confirmed cases in Lincolnshire, Cheshire and North Yorkshire, and also north Wales and Anglesey. This wave of avian influenza is also spreading around Europe. Experts suspect the illness is now endemic in wild birds, creating a year-round risk of infection. There is as yet no available vaccine against bird flu. At the end of last month, among other measures, the government ordered that all poultry and other captive birds in England be housed indoors. This was an extension of the housing order that had been in place in Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of Essex since mid-October. However, many in the poultry industry believe this move came too late. They had been calling for several weeks for a nationwide poultry housing order after an upsurge in outbreaks. More cases on farms are expected as more migratory birds return to the UK for winter. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it had announced 'a package of support including quicker compensation packages, as well as stepping up biosecurity rules to minimise the risk of the disease spreading.' The package also included a change to the rules of the bird flu compensation scheme available to farmers: they are now eligible for compensation payments from the start, rather than the end, of a planned culling. And in a move designed to give them more certainty over business planning, poultry farmers are now allowed to slaughter their animals early and freeze them, so the birds can be defrosted and sold to consumers in the run-up to Christmas, labelled 'previously frozen.' Third-generation turkey farmer Paul Kelly has already started processing some of his birds, several weeks earlier than usual, to dodge rising bird flu cases. 'It's the Covid of poultry, except that turkeys and other poultry don't get sick and recover; they just die,' he says from his farm in Essex. 'I can honestly say this is the worst year I have had to deal with in my entire business career.' Kelly calls the government's compensation scheme 'not fit for purpose.' He lost 9,000 of his 65,000 Christmas turkeys after an outbreak of bird flu at one of his sites, although his premium KellyBronze birds were not affected. Unlike other livestock, under current legislation farmers are only compensated for the number of birds that are fit and healthy at the start of a bird flu cull. 'Our industry is saying this is many years out of date and isn't fit for purpose,' Kelly says. Hundreds of birds can succumb to the illness between the farm notifying the authorities of an outbreak, and officials arriving to start the cull. Poultry is an 'unsupported sector' according to Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers' Union. She warns that, with bird flu coming on top of 30% cost price inflation, farmers are struggling. 'We've got to make sure that we do not lose the critical mass of poultry producers, for eggs and meat,' Batters adds. 'We've got to take special action. We have severe market failure on the back of a disease. The compensation package has to be enough to give farmers the confidence to keep producing, because they are also facing inflationary costs.' Howard Blackwell is another Essex turkey farmer who finds himself literally and figuratively at a loss after a bird flu outbreak among his flock of 5,500 turkeys and 1,800 geese in early October. The 59-year-old introduced turkeys to the arable farm set up by his grandparents at Coggeshall, near Braintree, in 1983, as an extra source of income. But he estimates that he will have lost nearly £100,000 as a result of the outbreak, and is currently unclear how much compensation he will receive. His farm shop and wholesale meat business have been allowed to continue operating, but under stringent restrictions. Bird flu is not a one-season worry for Blackwell and other affected farmers. The complex and costly clean-up operation required after an outbreak, which can include a legally enforced 12-month delay in restocking with birds, means he is not sure whether he will even be allowed to rear poultry next year. Until there is a bird flu vaccine, Blackwell is fearful for the future. 'It's like Russian roulette. If you haven't got a vaccine, you could restock and it could happen again.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 9}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 5}]}

This means that there are less chicken and fewer eggs in the supply chain, with egg supply particularly affected at the moment. Egg farmers have warned that the shortages are likely to worsen. The British Free Range Egg Producers Association said: \"Many of our members are losing money on every egg laid, and our data shows that even those who are making a small profit do not see a long-term future. Fewer hens means fewer eggs and we warned in March that eggs could be in short supply by Christmas. On top of this, avian influenza has resulted in the culling of laying hens too.\" They are also asking Sainsbury's for an urgent meeting after the retailer confirmed it is stocking eggs imported from Italy. Robert Gooch, BFREPA Chief Executive, said: \"We have been warning for months that failing to pay farmers a price which allows them to make a profit would result in mass de-stocking or, worse still, an exodus from the industry.\" Now, I thought those tweeting about @Tesco and a lack of eggs were joking. Not so. Just after 8 this morning in my local store. The egg bay is very empty indeed. pic.twitter.com/MkEY4pQ4gR —Brian Winter (@brianwinteruk) November 15, 2022 They added that, due to farmers leaving the business and the effects of bird flu, 227,350 free-range birds, 24,000 organic and 447,000 caged birds had been lost since 1 October —more than 743,000 this season. In the 2021 season, 1.8 million chickens were lost. Another major issue affecting egg supply is the price of farming; feed and housing costs have rocketed but supermarkets are not matching these increases in their payments to suppliers. This is causing some egg farmers to leave the business. Sources at the Waitrose supermarket chain seemed more optimistic about their egg supply than rivals. While they are \"monitoring the situation\" they do not expect shortages or rationing in the near future. Bird flu is hitting products across the supply chain. Oxo, the stock company, warned that its free-range products are no longer that, because chickens are being housed inside.

It is believed that the cub, which was located in Bartlett Cove in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve west of Juneau, is the second bear diagnosed with the highly pathogenic bird flu, the Juneau Empire reported. Bird flu passes really easily to poultry, but mammals aren’t really susceptible to it,” said Dr. Kimberlee Beckmen, a wildlife veterinarian for the department. “It’s difficult to get, but we suspect the cub probably ate a bird that died from avian influenza.” The bear likely became ill because it was a small, young animal with a weak immune system, she said. Since the virus was first detected in an adult female black bear in Canada in June, Alaska state officials have tested scavenging animals for it. So far, it’s only been found in two other animals, both red foxes in Dutch Harbor and the western Alaska community of Unalakleet. Finding bird flu in the bear and foxes is not an indication it’s likely to spread to other animals or to people, Beckmen said. “This particular strain, people are pretty much immune to it,” she said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this strain of bird flu poses a “very low” risk to humans, and only one person in the U.S. has been diagnosed in this outbreak. However, the flu has hammered the state’s wild bird population. People in Glacier Bay last month noticed that the cub, one of three accompanying a sow, had difficulty walking, according to state wildlife officials. The sow abandoned the cub and a biologist picked it up. However, it began suffering seizures, as did the Canadian bear previously diagnosed with the illness. The Alaska bear was euthanized by a state biologist. Later testing confirmed the presence of the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza.

As the virus sweeps through commercial and backyard chicken and turkey flocks, agriculture officials are encouraging poultry producers to look out for signs of infection and report any cases to state or federal officials. Nebraska, where 6.8 million birds have been affected by the outbreak, is the second worst-hit state behind Iowa, where 15.5 million birds have been culled.

It's the largest outbreak since 2015, when 50 million birds died. There's little chance of humans contracting the virus. Human cases are extremely rare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as properly cooking poultry and eggs will kill bacteria and viruses. The bird flu outbreak has also contributed to the rise in consumer prices for eggs and poultry meat, on top of hiked-up costs from inflation.

Just like on other farms where bird flu has been found this year, all the chickens on the Nebraska farm will be killed to limit the spread of the disease.

Nebraska is second only to Iowa with 15.5 million birds killed with 6.8 million birds now affected at 13 farms. In most past bird flu outbreaks the virus largely died off during the summer, but this year's version found a way to linger and started to make a resurgence this fall with more than 6 million birds killed in September. The virus is primarily spread by wild birds as they migrate across the country. Wild birds can often carry the disease without showing symptoms. The virus spreads through droppings or the nasal discharge of an infected bird, which can contaminate dust and soil. Commercial farms have taken a number of steps to prevent the virus from infecting their flocks, including requiring workers to change clothes before entering barns and sanitizing trucks as they enter the farm, but the disease can be difficult to control. Zoos have also taken precautions and closed some exhibits to protect their birds. Officials say there is little risk to human health from the virus because human cases are extremely rare and the infected birds aren't allowed to enter the nation's food supply. Plus, any viruses will be killed by properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

Numerous pelicans were found dead over the weekend along Venezuela's coast as the species arrived amid their annual winter migration. Other outbreaks among pelicans prompted bird flu alerts in Peru and Ecuador. Avian flu has been striking migratory birds across North America and in many other countries in recent months. The pelicans' bodies appeared on beaches and waterfronts, mangrove forests and up in the trees in the northwest state of Anzoátegui. Tests turned up positive cases of bird flu. As a preventative measure, the government imposed a 90-day quarantine on five states: Anzoátegui, Sucre, Nueva Esparta, Miranda and La Guaira. Agriculture Minister Wilmer Castro Soteldo suggested in a statement that the National Institute of Agricultural Health will work to avoid its spread to birds of other species, especially those eaten by humans. These rules prohibit moving live birds and fertile eggs from the quarantined states, and entire flocks that may have had contact with infected birds must be sacrificed, the statement said. The infected pelicans arrived in Venezuela amid their species' annual winter migration, the government said. Peru and Ecuador also are under alerts for bird flu outbreaks. The absence of live birds is already evident in the markets of Caracas.

The infection risk to humans is low, but authorities recommend care be taken to minimize risk even further. Waterfowl hunters are encouraged to harvest birds that act and look healthy; avoid eating, drinking or smoking while handling harvested birds; wear disposable gloves while processing the birds; harvest birds outdoors or in a well-ventilated area and wash hands, utensils, and surface areas thoroughly after processing the birds.

With an international agreement on the use of vaccinations likely to be one or two years away, the situation will probably worsen this winter as outbreaks of bird flu continue to rise. Globally, the disease and related culling has killed 140 million poultry since October 2021, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health. This includes almost 48 million birds in Europe and the UK combined and just over 53 million in the US. 'If an industry can only remain by culling millions of animals it is not sustainable,' said Arjan Stegeman, professor of veterinary medicine and epidemiologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Stegeman fears the next bird flu season may again be severe, suggesting culling will continue and there are similar concerns in the UK and US. Dr Christine Middlemiss, the UK's chief veterinary officer, said: 'We are seeing a growing number of bird flu cases. Unfortunately, we expect the number of cases to continue to rise over the coming months.' The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said although it cannot predict exactly what we will see in the coming months or years 'we believe it's important for people to plan for an elevated [avian flu] risk.' Costs and compensation in the US for this year's outbreak total almost $570m (£465m), the USDA said. An EU source, who preferred not to be named, said: 'According to the information provided, member states have spent about €240m (£208m) to combat avian influenza outbreaks.' Responding to a recent parliamentary question Defra said £2.48m has been paid to compensate for healthy birds culled due to avian flu since 1 October 2022. No compensation is paid for birds who get sick or die from avian flu. At least 4 million birds in the UK have been culled or died from bird flu during this outbreak. Protecting poultry by keeping them indoors and culling sick flocks are now the main bird flu control methods. Neither the USDA, EU or the UK government answered questions about the acceptability or morality of mass culling as a disease management tool. 'It is becoming almost normalised now that millions of birds are being culled, which is plain wrong,' said Dan Crossley, executive director of the the Food Ethics Council. Stegeman said the current scale of culling was 'unethical' but that culling was currently unavoidable because avian flu 'is really lethal for the flocks and 99% are going to die anyway.' Culling, however, will not stop the spread, he said. 'Twenty years ago, culling for avian flu was acceptable because it was rare and it made sense to cull birds because you also stopped the virus. Now we have the disease in wild birds so you can cull, but that's not going to help stop the spread of the virus. This is a human-made problem that has arisen in south-east Asia because the H5N1 avian flu virus was not controlled properly. It started in 1996 in China, where the duck and poultry [sector] expanded rapidly, and then it spilled over to wild birds.' According to Dr Steven McCulloch, a senior lecturer in human-animal studies at the University of Winchester, the muted nature of public concern was probably due to 'a lack of knowledge and awareness of the scale of culls, and a lack of visibility because compared to the burning pyres of cattle we had with the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001' the birds are kept in sheds. The president of the British Veterinary Association, Malcolm Morley, said culling was only acceptable because influenzas 'don't tend to become endemic [achieve constant presence in a community]; we tend to get outbreaks and then they die off.' In Italy, footage of a mass cull posted on the YouTube channel of animal charity Essere Animali appeared to show a botched operation in which live chickens were moved by digger into a container, before gases such as CO2, argon or nitrogen were added. 'The right method would be to fill the container with gas first then put the chickens in, so they die in a few seconds,' said Francesco Ceccarelli, the charity's investigations director. Containerised gassing is one of the UK's preferred culling options, along with whole-house gassing. Richard Webby, a virologist at St Jude Children's Research hospital who studies influenza in birds and other animals, said that although culls are a standard response in many countries, they were not 'the moral way forward in a context where bird flu is endemic in wild birds now.' Both Webby and Stegeman believe vaccines are needed, but they are controversial. 'We are not going to get rid of H5 [bird flu] by vaccination, but it will reduce the scale of the culling, we hope,' said Webby. Vaccination trials on commercial poultry are now under way in Europe, but there are, as yet, no international agreements on their use. The European Commission said it had asked the European Food Safety Authority to issue a new scientific opinion on vaccination against bird flu, which is expected to be available after summer 2023. The chicken industry is wary of trade restrictions damaging the poultry trade and suggest getting agreement on the use of vaccinations could take up to two years. The UK government said despite vaccines' ability to reduce mortality, disadvantages include the possibility of some vaccinated birds transmitting the disease without showing signs of sickness, making it harder to detect and eradicate the virus. The USDA said: 'At this time [vaccines] would have detrimental impacts on poultry trade while still necessitating response activities such as quarantine, depopulation, and surveillance testing.'

(AP) Four new cases of bird flu at Iowa turkey farms in the past few days will push the number of birds slaughtered nationwide this month to limit the spread of the virus up to nearly 700,000. The latest cases announced by the Iowa Department of Agriculture only add to the toll of this year's ongoing outbreak that has prompted officials to kill more than 53 million birds in 47 states. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock is killed to help control the disease. Iowa officials said the latest cases found since Friday involved 240,000 birds on turkey farms in Sac, Buena Vista, Cherokee and Ida counties all in the northwest corner of the state. Iowa leads all states with nearly 16 million chickens and turkeys slaughtered this year more than double the next closest state of Nebraska largely because it is the nation's largest egg producer and egg farms can include millions of chickens. Several other bird flu cases have been confirmed this month at other turkey farms in Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota and Missouri. An upland gamebird producer in Colorado also had to slaughter 18,000 birds to limit the spread of the virus. Experts believe the virus that causes bird flu is spread primarily by wild birds as they migrate across the country. The virus spreads easily through droppings or the nasal discharge of an infected bird, which can contaminate dust and soil and be carried onto farms on boots and clothing or on truck tires. Even though wild birds can often carry avian influenza without developing symptoms, the virus has killed a large number of eagles, vultures, ducks and other wild birds. Farmers take measures like requiring workers to change clothes before entering barns and sanitizing trucks as they enter the farm, but the disease is difficult to control. This year's outbreak is different than most past ones because the virus found a way to linger throughout the summer when warmer temperatures usually largely kill off the virus. The U.S. Department of Agriculture resumed reporting large numbers of birds infected in September when more than 6 million birds had to be killed. That was followed by another 2 million in October and nearly 4 million more in November. Bird flu doesn’t represent a significant threat to human health because human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation’s food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.

Wholesale prices of Midwest large eggs hit a record $5.36 a dozen in December, according to the research firm Urner Barry. Retail egg prices have increased more than any other supermarket item so far this year, climbing more than 30% from January to early December compared with the same period a year earlier, and outpacing overall food and beverage prices, according to the data firm Information Resources Inc. For supermarkets, eggs are a staple product that most consumers pick up on trips to the grocery store, similar to milk and butter. To maintain store traffic, grocers said they have been sacrificing some profits on eggs to keep prices for consumers competitive. Some suppliers are projecting potential relief in price by February or March, but cold weather could hamper production in the near term, executives said. \"We are trying to keep eggs relatively accessible,\" said Dan O'Neill, director of center store and perishables at Angelo Caputo's Fresh Markets, a chain of eight stores in Illinois. Angelo Caputo's bought extra-large eggs for $5.09 a dozen recently, up from $1.30 at the start of the year, Mr. O'Neill said. The grocer has for months been selling eggs for slightly above cost, he said, as wholesale prices have increased. Grocery prices have continued to increase this year because of what companies have said are higher costs of labor, ingredients and logistics, helping supermarkets generate higher sales and profits. Those factors have propelled egg prices, too. As eggs get more costly, some supermarkets are selling more organic eggs that are sometimes less expensive than conventional varieties, while suppliers say consumer demand has remained steady despite higher prices. Cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have so far this year led to the deaths of about 58 million birds, the deadliest outbreak in U.S. history, according to Agriculture Department data. Entire poultry flocks are destroyed after an infection is confirmed, to help limit the outbreak's spread. More than 40 million egg-laying chickens have died in the current outbreak, according to USDA data, with the total supply of egg-laying chickens falling more than 5% to about 308 million from the start of January to December. Despite a tight egg supply and high prices, shortages are still a long way off, said Emily Metz, chief executive of the American Egg Board, which represents egg producers. Egg supplies have been more stable this year compared with the previous major U.S. avian-influenza outbreak, in 2015, she said, as the time it takes for farms to recover from an outbreak has shrunk to roughly three months from six to nine months. The current outbreak has largely been attributed to wild birds spreading the virus to farms as they migrate across the country, agriculture-industry officials have said. While the 2015 outbreak ended in June, cases this year continued to pop up throughout the fall. Food-industry officials said they fear the current outbreak could continue. \"There's definitely a lot of cause for concern,\" said Karyn Rispoli, who determines egg pricing at Urner Barry. Wholesale egg prices have been rising for nine consecutive weeks, according to Urner Barry. Strong demand has driven prices higher in recent months as people bake more and eat warmer breakfasts during cooler weather, Ms. Rispoli said, though some consumers are starting to buy less. Steve Schwartz, director of sales and marketing at Morton Williams Supermarkets in New York, said: \"Every week you get an egg quote, it's more and more.\" There aren't many substitutes for eggs, grocery executives said. Specialty eggs, such as organic eggs that are sold to retailers and distributors on a fixed-price basis, can be about $1 cheaper a dozen, but there are only so many available brands of eggs for operators to secure, they said. \"Some of those replacement products are just as rare or expensive,\" said Max Bowman, chief financial officer of the largest U.S. egg producer, Cal-Maine Foods Inc., at a November investor conference. KeHE Distributors has been trying to secure a wider variety of egg brands, as well as plant-based egg alternatives, said Jennifer Onoja, a senior category manager of dairy, nondairy and refrigerated beverages at the grocery distributor. Eggs cost the company 20% to 50% more this year. \"These are essential categories that are staples in your refrigerator,\" she said. After the major outbreak in 2015, the USDA upgraded its virus testing and detection systems, training and equipment, officials have said. Some farmers invested in new biosecurity systems for their barns meant to disinfect anyone who walks into the tightly sealed poultry houses. Despite the changes, farmers and USDA officials have struggled to halt this year's outbreak. \"All signs are pointing to that this will be something the industry has to deal with,\" said Ms. Metz of the American Egg Board. \"We continue to manage it and improve in how we manage it.\" Write to Jaewon Kang at jaewon.kang@wsj.com and Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com Egg Prices Surge to Records as Bird Flu Hits Poultry Flocks", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 7}, {"key": "affirm_keyword_statement_1", "statement": "While the 2015 outbreak ended in June, cases this year continued to pop up throughout the fall.

{"id": "237", "fulltext": "In the past year, avian flu has ravaged colonies of seabirds in the UK. Gwen Potter, a National Trust countryside manager working on the Farne Islands, was among those who donned hazmat suits on the frontline. In May last year, our seabirds were starting to settle, having flown here from all over the world. It is an explosion of life, sound and smell and it looked as if it was going to be a really good year. On the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland, the most numerous bird is probably the puffin, we've also got a lot of guillemots, razorbills, kittiwakes, arctic terns, sandwich terns, common terns, loads of other fantastic seabirds. It's such a spectacle seeing all these birds fly in. The cliff-nesting birds are jostling for space, they're really crushed up against each other. You never take it for granted when you see the first birds coming back. Some have particular behaviours that you only see then. Kittiwakes, for example, do something called food begging. It's a display to their partner where they kind of fluff up their wings and go 'cheep cheep cheep' and show off their really bright throats. It is really cute. In a good year, we have 100,000 pairs. They start pairing up when they come back, and I always wonder if they were with the same partner last year; many of the species mate for life and might not have seen each other over winter. Humans don't belong everywhere, and this island is for birds. It is a privilege to be there and witness it. The first bird flu reports came in from north Scotland in May. It did make our ears prick up because it is not something we've seen before in our seabird colonies. Bird flu tends to thrive in cooler temperatures and isn't generally a problem during the summer, at least not in this country. Then it just started moving down the coast. We started to get really worried, as it got closer and closer. The razorbills went, then shags started to die. That was horrendous. One ranger saw a shag dead on its nest, chicks underneath. By the time it got to the Bass Rock off the coast of Edinburgh, we were hearing about gannets dying en masse. Then we saw one or two gannets on the Farne Islands, which you don't normally see. They were sitting on the edge looking out to sea. They didn't look right. It's hard to tell from a boat, but they looked ill. They probably came from the Bass. Initially, it was a couple of birds, and then a couple of days later, it was a lot. I went to the outer islands and saw an area of cliff usually covered in guillemots. There was one sitting there in the middle of it, and then just dead birds and rock. Some adults died where they were nesting, and there were lots of dead chicks, too. Whether they died of the disease or their parents died and they starved as a result, we don't know. I remember seeing one chick on its back, struggling with its little stubby wings helplessly flapping. The razorbills went, then shags started to die. That was horrendous. One of the rangers saw a shag dead on its nest with live chicks still underneath. We were thinking we must be able to do something about this, there must be some guidance, or some way to prevent it spreading, but everything was geared towards poultry farms. There was no information on wild birds. We were working in a highly ventilated environment so we found some PPE and decided we had to pick up the bodies to try to save as many of the live ones as possible. It would have been even harder to do nothing. Initially, we wondered: 'What do we do with the carcasses?' We couldn't bury them and didn't want to chuck them in the sea. In the end, we managed to get a company to come and collect and incinerate them. We figured that was the safest option, as we couldn't leave them. It was horrendous picking them up. It was really hot, and we were wearing hazmat suits with goggles. Some of them were not in good condition when we collected them, they were already rotting and smelt awful. In total, we picked up around 6,000 dead birds. We just couldn't keep up. What we collected was the tip of the iceberg. Going out to areas that we would never normally go to during the breeding season was shocking, too. I knew cliff nesters would be badly affected but I thought other birds such as fulmars and puffins might be OK because they tend to give themselves a bit more space, but they weren't. We found quite a few dead puffins, both adults and pufflings. The ones we found were those which were outside the burrow where they nest, we don't know how many were dead inside the burrow. I remember thinking that for the puffins to get it, it must be so virulent, so deadly. It is hard to describe. When you're watching a nest or tracking a nest, you realise each bird has its own personality, it is an individual with a life. Dare I say, a soul. It has its own agency. So when you see that bird that you've followed, struggling for life or dead, it's horrendous. There's nothing you can do to help, you know it's not going to recover and they don't die quickly. Often, sick birds gathered together in particular areas. On Brownsman, which is one of the outer group of islands, the sick kittiwakes would take themselves away from other birds and gather around a specific pond. All the birds sitting around that pond were dying. We saw hundreds of carcasses of birds washing up in the waves, too, including kittiwakes and guillemots, which must have died at sea. Picking up a tiny chick is horrible, because that chick has had no life. But then it is also horrible with an enormous gannet or a shag, they're hard to get into a bag. Whatever size or age a bird is, many of these birds have travelled across the globe to be here. The amount of things they have faced out there, and then they come to die, here, like this. We want to protect them and we can't. The biggest test of the impact will be how many come back next year and there is no sign of it going away. For the rangers, it can be psychologically really devastating. If it sweeps through again, I can't see how some populations are going to be able to recover. For the great skuas, they think it could be an extinction-level event. Some of these birds on the island exist in tiny numbers. The terns worry me in particular, but shags are red list, kittiwakes are red list, puffins are red list. Some of them are vulnerable on a global scale to extinction. Seabirds face enough threats without this, it's not good. As told to Phoebe Weston.

{"id": "238", "fulltext": "Ministers considering change that would class eggs laid by hens kept in barns for months under restrictions as free range Free-range egg rules in the UK could be relaxed in response to the European Union preparing to overhaul regulations after the biggest avian flu outbreak on record. Ministers are understood to be considering a change to the rules that would mean eggs laid by hens kept in barns for months on end could be classed as free range. Currently, eggs cannot be classed as free range if birds are indoors for more than 16 weeks. Farmers have that grace period in both the EU and UK, which means eggs can still be labelled as free-range if a government-issued housing order for birds is in place up to 16 weeks. Subsequently, labels need to be added to packaging making it clear that those are now classified as barn eggs. Whitehall sources told the Daily Telegraph that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is considering changing the regulations in order to keep farmers competitive with Europe. In 2022, the UK experienced its largest outbreak of bird flu and experts have warned that infections could rise even higher over the winter. The outbreak has led to the death of 97 million birds globally, and 3.8 million in the UK, according to government data in November. In October, poultry producers from as far north as Norway's Svalbard islands to southern Portugal collectively reported almost 2,500 outbreaks of the disease since last year. In the event that proposed changes to EU regulations are adopted, farmers in the bloc would be able to continue labelling eggs as free-range during avian flu outbreaks even if chickens had been kept indoors for more than 16 weeks. The European Commission put forward a proposal in September, which stated 'where temporary restrictions have been imposed on the basis of EU legislation, eggs may be marketed as free-range notwithstanding that restriction.' The proposal, which is awaiting approval by the European parliament, means eggs could be classed as free range even if hens are forced to spend months indoors due to government rulings. In September, egg producers in the UK said it was essential that the government now followed suit to avoid British suppliers being undercut by EU imports. Robert Gooch, chief executive of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association, said at the time: 'It's very necessary that the UK aligns with the EU, otherwise retailers will import eggs labelled as free range from housed hens in the EU in the event of an AI epidemic when there are none on the UK market.' In past years, outbreaks of avian influenza declined with warmer weather and the end of the wild-bird migration in the autumn and winter months. But outbreaks have continued across the UK and elsewhere in Europe for far longer this year. Last year, almost two-thirds of the 11.3bn eggs produced in the UK were free range. About 70% of the eggs sold in British supermarkets are free-range, according to market research company Kantar, almost double the level in 2014.

{"id": "239", "fulltext": "Expert warns impact of H5N1 virus across the world is on a scale akin to the devastation wreaked by the use of DDT pesticides in the 1950s and 1960s. The planet is experiencing a new 'Silent Spring' of wildlife destruction because so many wild birds have died from avian flu, according to a leading scientist, who said the past year has seen the most significant and sudden loss of birds in decades. James Pearce-Higgins, director of science at the British Trust for Ornithology, said: 'The last time we experienced such large-scale and rapid losses of wild birds in the UK would be the impacts of DDT on birds of prey in the 1950s and 1960s associated with the Silent Spring narrative, or the widespread declines of farmland birds during the 1970s and 80s as a result of agricultural intensification.' The Silent Spring narrative refers to the seminal 1962 book by Rachel Carson about how pesticides, particularly DDT, were killing birds. DDT caused egg shells to become so thin that adults crushed them during incubation, leading to nest failure and the deaths of thousands of birds. The World Organisation for Animal Health estimates that more than 50,000 wild birds have died of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 since October 2021, mainly in Europe and America. But experts say this is likely to be a huge underestimate. In the UK alone, numbers could be in the hundreds of thousands, although conservationists say the true impact is still unknown, and most are unwilling to speculate. In the UK, the effects of avian flu started in the northernmost islands of Scotland in spring, spreading south down the east coast of England reaching as far south as Sussex, with colonies of nesting seabirds the worst hit. Already there are more than a dozen outbreaks dotted across the country among wintering waterbirds. This suggests it is already widespread and will be found in breeding seabird colonies again next year, said Pearce-Higgins. There were more than 3,500 virus detections in wild birds across Europe in the 2021-2022 season, with reports from 37 countries that it was being seen in 63 wild bird species, according to an avian influenza overview published by the European Food Safety Authority. For wild birds, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the UK had the most reported cases, with most coming from coastal areas because seabirds were the worst affected. The first US case in this current outbreak was in an American wigeon duck in South Carolina on 14 January 2022. Since then, there have been 3,700 positive tests in 47 states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet testing should not be taken as an indicator of impact, because only a fraction of birds that die will be collected and sent for laboratory testing, researchers say. 'Reported numbers are likely a vast underestimate,' said Michelle Wille from the University of Sydney. 'For example, of the approximate 8,000 sandwich terns that died in the Netherlands, only a handful are included in the official numbers—in this case a more than 200x difference between reported numbers and observed. The lack of appreciation for the scale of wild bird mortality is concerning as there may be species/population level ramifications.' Globally, most reports are coming from Europe, and then America, according to UN mapping data, but the disease has also spread through Africa and Asia. In November this year, bird flu was found in South America, with concerns that it will reach the Galápagos. Scientists suspect that a migratory Franklin's gull brought the subtype H5N1 from the US. More than 13,000 seabirds died, including more than 5,500 pelicans in Peru. It has since spread to five countries in South America, according to the Pan American Health Organization. 'The high-pathogenicity avian influenza outbreak recently reported for coastal Peru is a severe situation. Evidence has shown the possibility of the virus spreading among other groups of birds,' said Luis German Naranjo, the conservation director at WWF Colombia. The UK has about 60% of the world population of great skua and northern gannets. Both have seen 'unprecedented levels of mortality' said Pearce-Higgins, with population impacts likely to last decades as they are long-lived, slow reproducing species. Experts say the picture will become clearer in the coming years, as we see how many migratory seabirds come back to breed, giving a better idea of how many died.

{"id": "240", "fulltext": "Wild bird populations have been decimated across the UK and scientists fear there is more to come in 2023. It is more than a year since avian flu began to devastate wild birds in large numbers, and conservationists are fearful of what 2023 will hold. The highly infectious variant of H5N1 has caused Europe’s worst bird flu season and has spread across the globe with little sign of slowing. In the UK, there were reports of some great skua dying from the H5N1 variant in the summer of 2021 but the mass die-offs started in the autumn and winter. More than a third of Svalbard barnacle geese in the Solway Firth, on the border of England and Scotland, 6,500 out of 43,000 died last winter. A year later, there has been no letup, with Greenland barnacle geese on the Scottish island of Islay (the other main site where these geese overwinter) dropping dead in increasingly large numbers. 'I’m sitting with a sense of dread that it definitely will get worse as I see more reports coming in from reserves across the UK,' says Claire Smith from RSPB Scotland. 'I’m haunted by the numbers of dead great skua that I saw on Shetland in the summer and I’m avoiding going birdwatching on the coast.' From April to mid-August 2022 avian flu ravaged colonies of seabirds in the UK, peaking in June at the height of the breeding season. These birds had previously been affected by H5N1 at very low levels. Seabirds generally migrate over summer, so numbers dropped again, but already there are outbreaks across the country among wintering waterbirds (which typically gather in large flocks, making them more vulnerable at this time of year). There have been cases in the south-west, the Midlands, East Anglia, Wales and the Isle of Man, each with numbers in the tens or low hundreds of dead water birds, with greylag geese, pink-footed geese, Canada geese and mute swans among the most affected. Red-listed herring gulls across the north-east are already being impacted, with dead puffins washing up in Norfolk, which is unusual at this time of year when there is no stormy weather. They are yet to be tested, but the presumed cause of death is bird flu. Cases in other groups of birds have been reported all over the country, and the RSPB called for a temporary ban on the release of game birds this year, to lessen the risk of spreading avian flu, but this was not taken up by government. Positive tests in peregrine falcons, buzzards, wild tawny owls and rooks have been recorded in recent months. Although there are not the same big die-offs, there are a lot of cases over a wide area, with more in urban and semi-urban areas. Positive tests are not an indication of the actual number of birds affected because few carcasses are found, let alone tested. 'We can expect HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] to persist into the next breeding season and beyond, with unpredictable consequences,' a report from the International Seabird Group conference warned in November. This will be the equivalent to our Covid pandemic, because we’re dealing with major outbreaks, major fatalities – Prof Kin-Chow Chang, University of Nottingham. It is a case of waiting to see what happens next, says Prof Ian Brown, head of virology at the government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). Commercial hens can be shut up, but you cannot control the movement of wild birds. 'That horse has bolted,' he says. 'It is unusual that this particular event is dominated by one particular strain over such a big geographical area. I can’t remember any time since 1996 [when H5N1 started], where a single strain has caused so much global spread.' Bird flu is highly infectious, with scientists saying one bird can infect as many as 100, with the virus present in faeces, mucus, blood and saliva. 'You need a very tiny quantity – a teaspoon of faeces will probably be enough to kill an entire house of chickens or turkeys,' says Brown. The most common transmission between wild birds and poultry is probably indirectly, through birds in the nearby environment. Unpublished studies have shown that at 4C, the virus can stay in the environment for six weeks, according to Brown. It could be someone walking across a field and treading in infected bird droppings, and then failing to disinfect their boots before going into the poultry house. Or it could be transferred on bedding, or possibly via rodents. Brown says that more than 99% of cases in poultry in the UK have come from wild birds. Apha knows this by working out the genome of a virus and comparing what it looks like in wild birds with its appearance in poultry. The researchers also look at the affected farm and possible routes of infection into poultry houses. Prof Kin-Chow Chang, from the veterinary school at the University of Nottingham, agrees commercial populations are getting it either directly or indirectly from wild birds. 'The virus is very infectious, it doesn’t need a lot to start an infection,' he says. Little is known about the number of birds with antibodies. Because vaccinations for wild birds are not considered a feasible option, they will need to get some sort of herd immunity. Brown says: 'There is a very small proportion of birds that can get infected, can recover from infection and then have immunity which means they won’t get that virus again. And over time that would build, but we don’t understand that at all. We need to do further work. That research is being commissioned and happening across the world.' The present variant of H5N1 originated in south-east Asia, where it was found in commercial geese. For the past four years, these strains of avian flu have been highly pathogenic, meaning they cause severe disease and death. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh are trying to work out why the current strain is causing longer and larger outbreaks than those that came before, which will also help understand how the disease will evolve and spread in the future. It could be down to changes in the surface proteins on the virus, meaning they can more easily attach to wild birds, or it may be more stable in the environment, so the virus could live in a pond over summer rather than breaking down in warm temperatures and sunlight as have previous bird flu viruses. It may become less damaging when sufficient numbers of birds have been infected, or the virus could evolve again, making it easier to spill into other species including mammals and humans. In August 2022, Defra said that mitigation strategies 'are not very effective in reducing transmission within seabird colonies.' However, there are other ways to reduce the pressures seabirds are under, as they have already been hit by a range of threats including habitat loss, overfishing and the climate crisis. Since 1986, the UK’s population of breeding seabirds has fallen by almost a quarter. Reducing these other pressures would make them more resilient to bird flu, says Smith. The RSPB says it is generally not picking up dead birds on its reserves because it risks the health of the people doing it, and causes disturbance among living birds which could spread the disease further. Visitors are asked to keep dogs on leads and to clean their shoes thoroughly before and after visiting. However, other wildlife groups, such as those working for the National Trust, have decided to collect carcasses because it could result in the disease spreading further if they are scavenged by others. Conservationists are calling for better monitoring and surveillance of the disease in wild birds, as well as clearer arrangements for carcass collection. Chang says: 'This will be the equivalent to our Covid pandemic, because we’re dealing with major outbreaks, major fatalities, and possibly major disruption to the domestic poultry production market as well.'

{"id": "241", "fulltext": "From the Scottish Highlands to the Cornish coast, Guardian readers have witnessed the ravages of the disease on wild species The world is experiencing its worst ever outbreak of avian flu in wild birds, with thousands dead and dying along coastlines, in gardens and cities. These Guardian readers from the UK were among those who got in touch to tell us about what they have witnessed: Retiree Allan Davidson said that by midsummer in 2022 miles of beautiful beaches near his home in Golspie, Sutherland, in the Scottish Highlands, were littered with dead seabirds, mainly guillemots and gannets. 'Most died out at sea and had been swept in to shore. Some would simply stand, comatose, oblivious to my presence. I would find them lifeless the next morning in the same spot I left them,' he says. 'What struck me was that the vast majority of the dead birds I encountered had been fine, healthy creatures in excellent condition. They were not emaciated or undernourished. No one was accepting responsibility for what was becoming a ghastly unnatural event of our making. Armed with a spade, several pairs of rubber gloves and a pair of wellies, I started at one end of the beach and spent four beautiful mid-summer evenings burying 98 guillemots, gannets, little gulls, herring gulls and one great skua.' He says he contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) and notified them of what he'd done. For David Mynne, an actor from Penzance, it is the lack of birds he finds strange. 'I live on the coast and have spent my life surrounded by squawking gulls. They fill the air with their noise, from sunrise to sunset, but now there is nothing. Not a sign of a gull anywhere. After a lifetime of the ceaseless, noisy chatter this feels distinctly weird.' Jo Clear works for the NHS and lives near Boldon pond in South Tyneside, where a pair of nesting swans raise cygnets each year. She says: 'The local kids, and anyone who walks past, enjoy watching them grow from fluffy babies to fully fledged birds. They waddle up and down a busy road, and the council even has a sign up saying Caution Swans nesting to make sure drivers slow down.' Last December, however, she drove past and noticed two people in hi-vis jackets by the pond. 'They were taking the dead swans away the seven cygnets and their mother. Only the male was left. They'd all had avian flu. All winter the male swam alone and serene up and down the pond. The whole village felt sorry for him. This spring, though, he found a new mate. They've had three cygnets this year. Fingers crossed they avoid avian flu. It has brought a bit of hope to everyone, and so the new female is called Hope.' Jenny Aitchison, a retiree from Aberdeen, says she has seen 'probably thousands' of birds affected by avian flu. 'Over the summer and autumn, I saw children chasing sick birds, dogs rolling on carcasses and people swimming only feet away from floating dead birds. When I spoke to people about avian flu, none had heard of it. Sepa and the local council advised reporting of large numbers. I did this after one beach visit where I saw over 100 bodies. I returned a month later, and the same birds were still there in an advanced state of decomposition with terns and gulls scavenging on the bodies.' Sue Wilkinson, a retiree from Topsham, near Exeter, was picking raspberries in her garden when a Canada goose skimmed past her head and landed a foot away, crushing some raspberry canes. 'I screamed and ran inside,' she says. 'My husband managed to manoeuvre the goose on to the lawn, using a rake to encourage it. It walked round in circles for a while, looking dazed, and eventually lay down in a corner of the garden. The next morning it was dead. We contacted the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they said they weren't interested unless there were three dead birds. We also contacted the RSPB, the RSPCA, a swan sanctuary and the local council without success. We were told to put it in the dustbin but didn't want to handle it or leave it there for 10 days before the next collection. In the end, we paid someone to remove it.' Geoff Humble, a member of university admissions staff in Leeds, says he saw dozens of gannets washed up on the German island of Spiekeroog this summer. 'It was awful,' he says. 'On some stretches, a bird lay every few metres in the sand. The lifeguards were burying any they came across, but said they had seen hundreds.' Its neck was contorting and it was unable to fly away from me. I knew immediately that it was dying Heidi Stern Heidi Stern, a project manager from Saddleworth, near Oldham, has struggled with poor mental health for decades and took up photography to improve her wellbeing. She was at one of her favourite nature reserves when she spotted a sick bird. 'While walking between hides I noticed a large greylag goose very close to the path,' she says. 'I approached to take a photo then realised its neck was contorting and it was unable to fly away from me. I knew immediately that this goose was dying of the dreaded disease.' She called the local RSPB warden so it could be removed. 'I stood and waited with tears rolling down my face,' she says. 'Frampton Marsh is a haven, a place of beauty and tranquility where I could escape in times of crisis. Now it's having a devastating crisis of its own, one which essentially we can do nothing about. What a tragic state of affairs we are in, politically, economically and now it feels like even the beautiful birds we are surrounded by are suffering a heartbreaking catastrophe of their own.' Kate Hardy, from Essex, works in healthcare and loves bird-watching. She says she started the year exploring the Highlands of Scotland, visiting black grouse breeding grounds, watching long-tailed ducks and getting dive-bombed by great skua. 'The end of the year makes for a devastating contrast,' she says. 'Those same shores sources of such keen pleasure for me are now laden with the corpses of gannets and other precious seabirds. One of the most devastating sights for me was the colony of sandwich tern off Blakeney Harbour [in Norfolk]. I watched affected birds falling into the sea, with other birds from the colony swirling around them in obvious distress.

{"id": "242", "fulltext": "Experts say record waves of avian influenza have been setting off alarms, with fears virus could adapt to spread among people. Multiple waves of avian influenza have left a trail of devastation across the globe, leading to the deaths and culling of more than 300 million chickens, ducks and geese and an unknown number of wild birds between 2005 and 2021. Today, with parts of Europe and North America in the midst of the worst outbreak on record, a global cohort of researchers is keeping cautious watch amid concerns about the impact the disease could have on humans. 'There is concern about it having pandemic potential,' says Wendy Blay Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University. 'Before Covid was on anybody's radar, this was the one that we were all watching very closely.' The virus is currently considered a low risk to humans, she says. 'But anything that has the ability to replicate and evolve rapidly, and anything that has that ability to infect a lot of different hosts is kind of on borrowed time.' Much of the focus of experts is on H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza that has fuelled, in part, the surge in cases around the world. First identified at a goose farm in Guangdong, China in 1996, the virus has turned up in at least 63 species of wild birds and has shown itself capable of infecting mammals such as bobcats, harbour seals and bears. If it has become established in wild birds, it is far more complex to control it and predict where it will go next, says Nichola J Hill, University of Massachusetts. The more the virus spreads, the greater the chances are that it may spill over into humans, says Thijs Kuiken, a professor in the department of viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam. Once the virus infects humans, the concern is that it could further adapt to allow human-to-human transmission. 'The chance of this happening is very small, but the impact if it does happen is very big, because it means that we then have a new influenza pandemic,' he says, pointing to the 1918 flu, believed to have killed as many as 50 million people, as an example of a pandemic that has been linked to an avian influenza and originating in birds. As H5N1 crisscrosses the globe, its impact on humans has set off alarms; between 2003 and October 2022, the virus turned up in 865 humans in 21 countries, resulting in 456 deaths. While the cases, most of them in Africa and Asia, were linked to the handling of infected live poultry rather than human-to-human transmission, the figures suggest the virus has a high case fatality rate in people who become infected, says Kuiken. Public health officials are taking few chances. In the UK, where a duck breeder tested positive for the virus in late 2021 after handling infected poultry, the Health Security Agency has been working to develop an 'off the shelf exercise' to prepare for an outbreak of avian flu among humans, the UKHSA told the Guardian in an email. In the Canadian province of British Columbia, public health officials recently warned doctors to watch out for avian flu infections among patients, after a spike in cases among poultry at local farms. The virus would probably require more than one or two changes to enable human-to-human transmission, says Ian Barr, the deputy director of the WHO's Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne. 'We never really know with these viruses but they've been with us for 18 years in various forms and they haven't yet gained that function of being easily transmissible to man,' says Barr. 'So, hopefully the virus finds that a difficult thing to do, but it's something which we're not entirely knowledgeable about.' He described it as a game of numbers. 'The more viruses that are out there, the more species that they infect, the longer they hang around for, then the more chance there is for something to mutate or go awry or reassort with an unwanted consequence.' Efforts to halt the spread of this strain of virus have been complicated by its prevalence in wild birds, says Rebecca Poulson of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia. 'We know birds move incredibly long distances,' she says. 'And if these birds are infected and are shedding these viruses as they move across the landscape, they can disseminate it quite far and wide in a really short amount of time.' The presence of the virus in wild birds and farmed poultry has allowed it to ping-pong between populations and amplify its spread, says Nichola J Hill, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. 'I think we used to cling to this idea that we can control the virus in poultry, we're set, no problem,' she says. 'And now we're facing a new era because if it has become established in wild birds, that's a far more complex situation in terms of figuring out how to control it and predict where it will go next.' What is clear, however, is the role our food system has played in getting us to this point, she says, citing the high densities of poultry seen in commercial farming and the genetic similarity of most of the animals. 'All of these amount to a situation which is ripe for the virus to get a foothold and then evolve towards virulence.'", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 25}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_2", "statement": "'The more the virus spreads, the greater the chances are that it may spill over into humans,' says Thijs Kuiken, a professor in the department of viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam."}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_3", "statement": "'Once the virus infects humans, the concern is that it could further adapt to allow human-to-human transmission.'"}, {"key": "affirm_humanspread_statement_2", "statement": "The more the virus spreads, the greater the chances are that it may spill over into humans."}, {"key": "affirm_humanspread_statement_3", "statement": "The more viruses that are out there, the more species that they infect, the longer they hang around for, then the more chance there is for something to mutate or go awry or reassort with an unwanted consequence."}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 14}, {"key": "deny_keyword_statement_2", "statement": "The chance of this happening is very small, but the impact if it does happen is very big, because it means that we then have a new influenza pandemic,"}]}
{"id": "243", "fulltext": "An avian flu outbreak and increasing costs of fuel, feed and packaging have contributed to an egg supply shortage and high prices in some parts of the country. A grocery staple that for decades has been a relatively cheap and reliable item has now become an elusive and even lavishly priced commodity. At a Whole Foods in Manhattan on Wednesday, shelves were empty for the cheapest eggs -- $3.39 for a carton of 12 large brown Grade A eggs. What remained were more expensive options like organic, cage-free eggs for more than $7. Even then, the customers were limited to two egg cartons, according to a sign on the refrigerator door, 'due to a nationwide shortage of eggs.' Other grocery stores, like certain locations of Kroger across the United States and Lidl in Britain, have also limited egg purchases. Prices of eggs across some countries are rising sharply. One factor behind the shortage and the sharp rise in egg prices is an outbreak of avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, a highly contagious virus that is often fatal to chickens. Since the outbreak was detected last February, more than 57 million birds in hundreds of commercial and backyard flocks have been affected by it, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Infected or exposed flocks are culled to prevent the virus from spreading, a measure that has resulted in the depopulation of more than 44 million laying hens in the U.S. since the outbreak, according to the Agriculture Department. The depopulations at commercial facilities have decreased the domestic egg supply by about 7.5 percent on average each month since the outbreak began, the department said. Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman with the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said that after facilities are sanitized and restocked with healthy laying hens, it takes about four to five months for them to 'reach peak productivity' of about 24 eggs per month. The virus has also been detected around the world, including in Canada and countries in Europe and South America, according to United Egg Producers, the trade group that represents most commercial egg farmers in the United States. Emily Metz, president and chief executive of the American Egg Board, said in an interview on Wednesday that while bird flu has played a role, increasing costs of fuel, feed and packaging have also contributed to pricier and scarcer eggs. 'Is avian flu a factor? Yes,' Ms. Metz said. 'Is it the only factor? No, and I would argue it's not even the biggest factor in where these prices are right now.' Combined, the avian flu and other rising costs have created scenes of empty shelves at grocery stores across the country, from Colorado to New York. In some instances, people have resorted to buying their own chickens, local media in Arizona and Massachusetts have reported. While the shortages have not been dire, the jump in prices is noticeable for consumers and businesses. In January 2022, the average price for a dozen of large Grade A eggs in the U.S. was $1.39, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By November, the average price had increased to $3.59. Ben Suh, the owner of Between the Bagel NY in Queens, said that he had tried to hold off on raising prices for as long as he could, but that he would soon increase the cost of menu items with eggs. For instance, the price of a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich will increase to $7 from $6, Mr. Suh said. 'Everyone's been struggling since the pandemic began, so we've been trying to keep our prices down,' Mr. Suh said. A year ago, Mr. Suh said he would typically pay $70 to $80 for 30 dozen eggs. Now, he is paying $150 to $160 for the same order, he said. 'Everything's doubled,' Mr. Suh said, adding that because of inflation, he has also had to pay more for other products, including bacon and coffee. At Brey's Egg Farm in Jeffersonville, N.Y., flocks of chickens have been spared from the avian flu. Daniel Brey, the farm's owner, said that after a destructive nationwide avian flu outbreak in 2014 and 2015 killed more than 50 million birds, he set up a gate around his farm to prevent wild birds from entering and potentially spreading diseases. Mr. Brey said that vehicles entering the farm were sprayed with disinfectant, another precaution to protect the farm, which produces 228,000 eggs daily. 'This stuff is so contagious,' Mr. Brey said of the bird flu. 'You've got to be careful everywhere.' While the avian flu rarely infects humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the contagiousness of the virus requires farmers to quickly euthanize infected and exposed flocks. 'This virus is fatal,' Ms. Metz said. 'Once it comes into contact with your flock, it will kill your birds.' Because there have been fewer reported cases of avian flu at commercial egg-laying facilities in recent weeks, Mr. Brey said that he believed the egg shortage would ease soon, as well as the high prices. But Mr. Brey said he was concerned that cases could rebound in the spring and spread to other birds, such as geese, ducks, hawks and eagles. So far this year, recorded cases of the avian flu dropped significantly, with only one commercial flock and 10 backyard flocks affected, according to the Agriculture Department, compared with more than 5.07 million birds in December and more than 3.75 million birds in November. A statement last week from United Egg Producers echoed that assessment, saying that there was an expected lull in the virus over the next two months, but the group warned of 'detections rapidly increasing as spring and the migration season renews.' Ms. Cole said that as farms restocked, supply would likely improve, but she cautioned that the virus was still lingering within the United States. 'We know there will continue to be a threat to domestic birds as long as the HPAI virus is circulating in wild birds, so all bird owners should continue to be vigilant,' Ms. Cole said, referring to the avian virus. For now, stores including some Kroger, Whole Foods and Lidl locations are limiting egg purchases for customers. A Kroger spokeswoman said that the bird flu had caused 'tens of millions of birds to be removed from the U.S. supply chain and egg production over the last nine months,' but that Kroger's 'egg supply remains adequate.' A Lidl spokesman said that 'in periods of high demand relative to product supply, as retailers nationally see today with eggs, our stores may place temporary quantity limits on high-demand products.' Ms. Metz said that as the avian flu lingers, farmers will have to continue to manage outbreaks of the virus, measures they are better prepared to take after the experience of the 2014-2015 outbreak. 'We're recovering so much more quickly than we did in 2015,' Ms. Metz said. 'Managing the virus is just going to be that much better, and it's going to be much less of a factor as we go forward in pricing.' Some stores, lacking egg supply, have limited the number of cartons customers can buy.

{"id": "244", "fulltext": "A new strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza -- commonly called bird flu -- has killed around 1,600 snow geese in two separate areas of Colorado since November, according to state wildlife officials. Unlike prior strains of the disease in North America, this strain is causing widespread mortality in some species of wild birds, particularly in snow geese, raptors, and vultures, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Bill Vogrin said in a statement to CNN on Monday. The agency began receiving reports of sick and dead snow geese in northeastern Colorado in late 2022, the statement said. It documented over 1,000 deaths on several waterways in Morgan and Logan counties. Then officials heard of large-scale mortalities in the southeastern portion of the state. There was a die-off of approximately 600 snow geese at John Martin Reservoir, the statement said, noting lower die-offs at surrounding reservoirs. After highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed in a certain species and county, the wildlife department will not test additional birds of that species within that county until the next season -- but additional deaths are still counted, the statement said. Birds carrying the disease can carry it to new areas when migrating, potentially exposing domestic poultry to the virus, the US Department of Agriculture says.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 1}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 0}]}
{"id": "245", "fulltext": "It's hard to swallow, but the rising cost of your breakfast is a taste you will be forced to acquire. Egg prices are up, along with that of bacon, because of climate-influenced animal disease and a growing world population that demands more protein. One of the world's largest producers of liquid eggs—already cracked and sold mostly in bulk to restaurants and bakeries—is practically in my backyard. Called Rembrandt Foods, the Northwest Iowa plant has been shut down since last spring over bird flu. It's the company's second shutdown in seven years. Five million laying hens were destroyed. More than 200 workers, mostly immigrant, were laid off. There is no word on when the huge henhouse will cluck again. The same flu caused more than 400,000 turkeys to be snuffed out in four counties around Storm Lake, Iowa, where the agri-giant Tyson Foods operates both turkey and pork processing plants employing some 3,000 workers. Maybe you've priced a turkey with mayo on wheat lately. Waterfowl spread the flu. In recent years, geese that used to migrate through the Dakotas and Nebraska shifted east to fly over the densest livestock production area in North America—Northwest Iowa—because of epic drought. As they fly, they poop, shedding virus as they go. A breeze passes over the teeming feces and into hog houses holding 1,000 porkers or turkey barns filled with 20,000 birds. Once the flu is inside, it spreads like... flu. No longer an epidemic, the flu has become endemic. It's not even seasonal anymore. Rembrandt's hens got hit in March while Tyson's turkeys went down in December. Experts exhort producers to practice biosecurity, but Rembrandt was. After a flu wave in 2015 killed production, the Rembrandt plant was sealed up tight. But a virus doesn't need a welcome mat to make itself at home. Meanwhile, China is trying to rebuild its swine herd. The pork-lovingest people on Earth lost half their hogs to African swine flu in recent years; in response, they are erecting high-rise hog hotels of up to 26 stories. And African swine flu is not the worst scenario: Encephalitis can jump from hogs to humans. When African swine flu spread to Haiti, my hometown shuddered: Storm Lake, Hog Capital of the World. You begin to wonder if packing 5 million hens into one huge building, as my neighbors at Rembrandt have done in pursuit of more liquid eggs at lower prices for hungry people, is such a good idea anymore. The Upper Midwest can't handle the manure we're already pumping. Our rivers are rife with nitrate and phosphorus from it. The Gulf of Mexico is suffocating from it. This is the price of modern food production. We never thought we'd see sliced turkey for $9.99 a pound right here in Turkey Town. Something has to change. It's too late to wipe out bird flu: Bears out West are catching it, the Agriculture Department reports. A human in China turned up with a different strain. A healthy way forward might take a little from the past and a lot from the future. Techniques from Grandpa's day unquestionably yield healthier animals. Chickens pecking in the yard survived the 2015 bird flu even as turkeys died by the tens of thousands in a mega-barn a few hundred feet away. A hog bred for the pasture has stronger immunity than his cousin in a Chinese high-rise. But human stomachs rumbling for protein number in the billions. How do we do healthy at massive scale? Tyson, among others, is investing in \"cultured\" meat grown from the cells of swine, cattle and poultry. Folks say the resulting chicken tastes like... chicken. The protein market will stratify: When a customer can afford a premium rib-eye, there will be an (expensive) steer in a healthy meadow to meet the demand. But folks who want a chicken strip, a deli sandwich, a meat-lover's pizza or a burger buried in cheese won't know the difference between today's factory animal and tomorrow's lab-grown meat. Most people scared of cultured meat have never seen how the stuff they're eating now gets made. As production of high-tech protein ramps up, the cost will come down—and demands on natural resources will ebb. (Arnold the pig can drink a gallon and a half of water per day.) And it's customizable. If you prefer fatty bacon, the beaker can accommodate that. Meantime, the price of prime Iowa farmland was up another 17 percent last year, reaching around $16,000 per acre. Brokers expect it to go higher this year. The smart money knows where the golden egg lies. So enjoy that breakfast—and while you can afford it, please leave the waitress a nice tip.

{"id": "246", "fulltext": "Three grizzly bears were euthanized in Montana after they became ill and tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, according to the state's Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks. These were the first documented cases of bird flu in a grizzly in Montana and the first nationwide for this outbreak of HPAI, according to Dr. Jennifer Ramsey, the department's wildlife veterinarian. The juvenile bears were in three separate locations in the western part of the state during the fall, the Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks said in a statement. The bears were observed to be in poor condition and exhibited disorientation and partial blindness, among other neurological issues, the statement said. They were euthanized due to their sickness and poor condition. Avian influenza -- commonly called bird flu -- is a naturally occurring virus that spreads quickly in birds. There were documented cases of HPAI in a skunk and a fox in Montana last year, and the virus has been seen in raccoons, black bears and a coyote in other states and countries, according to the Montana agency. The virus is spread from one bird to another, Dr. Ramsey told CNN via email. These mammals likely got infected from consuming carcasses of HPAI infected birds. Fortunately, unlike avian cases, generally small numbers of mammal cases have been reported in North America, Ramsey said. For now, we are continuing to test any bears that demonstrate neurologic symptoms or for which a cause of death is unknown. While finding three grizzlies with bird flu in a short period of time may raise concerns, Ramsey said it may well be that there have been more cases that haven't been detected. When wildlife mortalities occur in such small numbers or individuals, and in species like skunks, foxes and bears that don't spend a lot of time in situations where they are highly visible to the public, they can be hard to detect, the wildlife veterinarian said. When you get that first detection you tend to start looking harder, and you're more likely to find new cases, she said. When a large number of birds are found dead on a body of water, it gets noticed and reported... when someone sees a dead skunk, they may think nothing of it and not report it. While it's unknown just how prevalent the virus is in wild birds, we know that the virus is active basically across the entire state due to the wide distribution of cases of HPAI mortality in some species of wild birds, Ramsey said. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in November the country was approaching a record number of birds affected compared to previous bird flu outbreaks, with more than 49 million birds in 46 states dying or being killed due to exposure to infected birds. Human infections with bird flu are rare but are possible, usually after close contact with infected birds. The current risk to the general public from bird flu viruses is low, the CDC says on its website. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks is asking people to report any birds or animals acting unusual or unexplained cases of sickness and/or death.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "deny_count", "statement": 6}]}
{"id": "247", "fulltext": "The bears are believed to have contracted the virus from diseased birds, amid what a U.S.D.A. spokesman called the 'largest foreign animal disease outbreak in U.S. history.' Three young grizzly bears in Montana that were euthanized last fall later tested positive for the highly contagious avian influenza, the state's Fish, Wildlife and Parks service announced this week, fueling fears that the virus that has killed millions of poultry in the last year is rapidly spreading to other animal groups. The bears were disoriented, had begun to go blind and were euthanized as a result of their poor condition, the parks service said in a news release on Tuesday. They tested positive for the virus in January, said Dr. Jennifer Ramsey, the veterinarian for Fish, Wildlife and Parks. She said the bears had most likely contracted the virus from consuming diseased birds with high levels of the virus. The outbreak of the current strain of the bird flu known as H5N1 is 'the largest foreign animal disease outbreak in U.S. history,' according to a spokesman for the U.S. Agriculture Department. It has infected nearly 60 million commercial and backyard flocks of birds in 47 states, and its near ubiquity has driven up poultry prices and caused egg shortages in supermarkets across the country, as consumers jostle for cartons topping $7 or more. Most of the infections are found in wild birds, and some of those spread to other animals that prey on them. The Agriculture Department has recorded avian flu infections in 110 mammals since May 2022, including raccoons, foxes and skunks. The grizzly bears' positive tests mark the first time that Montana has recorded bird flu in a mammal species. 'It's disappointing,' Dr. Ramsey said in an interview. 'I think in the spring we had a really high peak of wild bird mortality and we all had a hope that this thing would kind of fade out over the summer, and then we wouldn't have a lot of cases this winter. But that hasn't been the case.' Vaccines against the bird flu exist but are not yet widely available for the H5N1 strain in the United States. Only a handful of cases have been recorded in humans. Dr. Ramsey said she recommended that humans keep their pets away from dead birds and wear gloves when handling any dead wildlife. Wild bird populations tend to migrate across hundreds of miles and are often asymptomatic when infected, making it difficult for wildlife experts to track and contain the virus. Should it continue to spread during the spring and summer when temperatures warm and mammals emerge from hibernation, infectious disease experts say, the virus is likely to become more widespread among other animal groups, including mammals and aquatic animals. Still, the extent of infection in birds is enough cause for concern for the experts tracking its spread.

{"id": "248", "fulltext": "Nearly a year after it began, the worst avian-influenza outbreak in U.S. history is continuing to decimate poultry flocks across the Midwest and Colorado, frustrating efforts to keep the virus from affecting the nation's egg prices and supply. In South Dakota, the highly contagious bird flu, typically transmitted by the feces, mucus and saliva of wild birds, first hit commercial poultry farms in March 2022 and has continued to affect flocks. Within the last month, egg-laying hens and turkeys at several local farms were infected, leading to the deaths of more than 1.3 million poultry over that period, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Nearly four million poultry have died in the state since the start of the outbreak. Nebraska, where more than 4.8 million poultry died during a 2015 bird-flu outbreak, has surpassed 6.7 million poultry deaths from the current outbreak, according to state and federal data. Colorado has lost more than 90% of its table egg-laying hens, while also seeing its population of wild birds including snow geese, raptors, hawks and eagles sickened, state officials said. \"One of the challenges is that we don't know why it has been able to thrive for so long. We're almost a full year into this outbreak and it is ongoing,\" said Maggie Baldwin, Colorado's state veterinarian. Some 6.25 million poultry in Colorado have died so far. People working on the problem say there is no easy way to stop the spread of bird flu. Instead, the virus must be allowed to run its course. \"There is no historical context for this. It's like when Covid hit for humans,\" said Mike Tincher, rehabilitation coordinator for Colorado's Rocky Mountain Raptor Program. To keep bird flu from spreading, entire poultry flocks must be destroyed after an infection is confirmed. The outbreak has caused the deaths of nearly 58 million poultry in 47 states, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. While it rarely affects humans, the disease is mostly fatal for domestic birds. It can also infect other animals. On Tuesday, Montana wildlife officials said three young grizzly bears had contracted bird flu during the fall and were euthanized, the first known cases of grizzlies getting the disease. The bears likely contracted the virus from eating infected birds, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks veterinarian Jennifer Ramsey. One facility in Colorado's Weld County that had restocked with healthy hens after initially having to euthanize its flock because of the virus was struck again by an outbreak last month, said Bill Scebbi, executive director of the Colorado Egg Producers, which represents five family farms. The facility had to euthanize its new flock, Mr. Scebbi said. He said the flu has been destructive to Colorado's egg industry, with farmers having to purchase eggs from out of state to meet customer demand. Egg farmers aren't insured against the virus, Mr. Scebbi said, and estimated losses are in the millions. \"It's been devastating to their businesses, to their farms and personally devastating to their livelihoods,\" he said. Still, according to Emily Metz, president and chief executive of the American Egg Board, which represents egg producers, many farms around the country are recovering from the outbreak. There are currently about 6% fewer hens laying eggs than normal nationwide, she said. According to the group, egg producers have developed better biosecurity measures since the 2015 outbreak, such as securing areas to keep wild birds away and keeping equipment clean, which can help keep the virus from spreading from farm to farm. Wholesale prices of Midwest large eggs hit a record $5.46 a dozen in December, according to the research firm Urner Barry. Prices have fallen back to $3.77 a dozen this month after the seasonal demand of the holiday baking season. In addition to the millions of poultry at farms that have been killed, many wild birds have been infected as well, officials said. Jim Gammonley, who supervises the avian research program for the Colorado Parks and Wildlife division, said the state has experienced die-offs of snow geese in the thousands due to the virus. The die-offs have typically occurred in and around reservoirs where the snow geese like to roost at night, he said. In one case, field staff were called to a reservoir just before Thanksgiving where they found about 1,000 dead geese, which they retrieved. The next day, the employees returned to check on the reservoir and found another 1,000 dead geese, Mr. Gammonley said. Mr. Tincher said his group had located 37 raptors that had tested positive for the virus and referred another 19 to state officials for testing. Such animals typically get the virus by feeding off diseased geese and ducks. \"We've never seen this before. And it's just not slowing down,\" he said.

Colorado has lost more than 90% of its table egg-laying hens, while also seeing its population of wild birds including snow geese, raptors, hawks and eagles sickened, state officials said. \"One of the challenges is that we don't know why it has been able to thrive for so long. We're almost a full year into this outbreak and it is ongoing,\" said Maggie Baldwin, Colorado's state veterinarian. Some 6.25 million poultry in Colorado have died so far. People working on the problem say there is no easy way to stop the spread of bird flu. Instead, the virus must be allowed to run its course. \"There is no historical context for this. It's like when Covid hit for humans,\" said Mike Tincher, rehabilitation coordinator for Colorado's Rocky Mountain Raptor Program. To keep bird flu from spreading, entire poultry flocks must be destroyed after an infection is confirmed. The outbreak has caused the deaths of nearly 58 million poultry in 47 states, according to USDA data. While it rarely affects humans, the disease is mostly fatal for domestic birds. It can also infect other animals. On Tuesday, Montana wildlife officials said three young grizzly bears had contracted bird flu during the fall and were euthanized, the first known cases of grizzlies getting the disease. The bears likely contracted the virus from eating infected birds, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks veterinarian Jennifer Ramsey. One facility in Colorado's Weld County that had restocked with healthy hens after initially having to euthanize its flock because of the virus was struck again by an outbreak in December, said Bill Scebbi, executive director of the Colorado Egg Producers, which represents five family farms. The facility had to euthanize its new flock, Mr. Scebbi said. Egg farmers aren't insured against the virus, Mr. Scebbi said, and estimated losses are in the millions. \"It's been devastating to their businesses, to their farms and personally devastating to their livelihoods,\" he said. Still, according to Emily Metz, president and chief executive of the American Egg Board, which represents egg producers, many farms around the country are recovering from the outbreak. There are currently about 6% fewer laying hens laying eggs than normal nationwide, she said.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 5}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_3", "statement": "While it rarely affects humans, the disease is mostly fatal for domestic birds.

{"id": "250", "fulltext": "A variant of H5N1 influenza that can spread between mammals could pose an increased risk to people and wild animals. An outbreak of avian influenza on a mink farm in Spain provides the strongest evidence so far that the H5N1 strain of flu can spread from one infected mammal to another. The outbreak of H5N1 flu, reported in Eurosurveillance on 19 January1, occurred on an American mink (Neovison vison) farm in Carral in October 2022. Genetic sequencing showed that the animals were infected with a new variant of H5N1, which includes genetic material from a strain found in gulls, as well as a genetic change known to increase the ability of some animal-flu viruses to reproduce in mammals. The new variant puts bird flu in 'uncharted territory' says Wendy Puryear, a virologist at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Researchers have warned that, unless careful precautions are taken, the disease might eventually spread among people. Jumping species Over the past year, H5N1 has shown an increasing ability to jump from birds to mammals. In the United States, infections have been found in about a dozen species, including raccoons, foxes, seals and grizzly bears. Until this particular outbreak, all mammalian infections could be attributed to direct contact with virus-contaminated material, says Hualan Chen, a virologist at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute in China. For example, animals that ingest wild-bird droppings, or that prey on infected animals, can develop the disease. But its spread between mammals 'implies that this H5N1 virus may pose a higher risk to public health' Chen says. During the first week of October 2022, workers on the affected mink farm noticed that the mink's mortality rate had increased from a baseline of 0.25% per week to 0.77%, prompting tests on the affected animals for the H5N1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The animals tested positive for H5N1. In the following weeks, more animals fell sick, and the disease seemed to spread from 'hotspots' of two to four pens, in which all animals became infected and died. Workers were forced to cull all 51,986 mink on the farm. Eleven farm workers came into contact with the infected mink, but all tested negative for H5N1. 'This species could serve as a potential mixing vessel for the interspecies transmission among birds, mammals and human,' the report's authors write. 'It is necessary to strengthen the culture of biosafety and biosecurity in this farming system and promote the implementation of ad hoc surveillance programs for influenza A viruses and other zoonotic pathogens.' Preventing spread Measures taken to prevent the new strain from spreading beyond the farm seem to have been 'rigorous, comprehensive and successful' says infectious-disease specialist William Schaffner at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. COVID mink analysis shows mutations are not dangerous yet But Puryear thinks that because the variant contains genetic material from gull flu, it's likely that at least some of its genetic changes arose in gulls before entering the mink farm. This means that a strain containing those mutations is probably still circulating in the bird population. But for human populations, the outlook is still good: if the new strain did start to infect people, health authorities could probably produce a vaccine quickly, and the antiviral drug Tamiflu (oseltamivir) can reduce the severity of the disease. The potential risk to wild animals is greater. Bird flu has consistently caused high levels of sickness and death among wild birds and mammals over the past year, and how the new variant will affect that trend remains to be seen. 'We just simply don't know,' says Puryear. References 1. Agüero M. et al.

{"id": "251", "fulltext": "Risk to humans, though low, is of concern after at least 200 cases of infection in mammals detected worldwide Avian flu surveillance is being ramped up in the UK after the detection of at least 200 cases of infection in mammals. Public health experts say the risk of a jump to humans is still very low, but that this risk would be monitored through increased genomic surveillance and targeted testing of people who had been exposed to the virus. Concern was also sparked by a recent outbreak of avian flu at a mink farm in Spain and a mass mortality of seals in the Caspian sea that is possibly linked to the infection. 'The virus is absolutely on the march,' Prof Ian Brown, the director of scientific services at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha), told the BBC. He added that experts were 'acutely aware of the risks' of avian flu becoming a pandemic like Covid. 'This global spread is a concern,' he said. 'We do need globally to look at new strategies, those international partnerships, to get on top of this disease.' Over the last two years, the UK has faced its largest outbreak of avian influenza, with more than 300 cases confirmed since October 2021 and with poultry farms all currently required to house birds indoors. Figures reported by the BBC show the virus has led to the deaths of about 208 million birds around the world and at least 200 recorded cases in mammals. In the UK, Apha has tested 66 mammals, including seals, and found nine otters and foxes were positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1. Such cases have been found in Durham, Cheshire and Cornwall in England; Powys in Wales; Shetland, the Inner Hebrides and Fife, Scotland. It is believed the animals had fed on dead or sick wild birds infected with the virus. 'The species affected — foxes and otters — are known to scavenge,' said Dr Alastair Ward, of the University of Leeds. 'In all likelihood, the affected individuals will have scavenged infected wild bird carcasses, which may have had very high viral loads. Such high exposure is likely to have overwhelmed the mammals' immune system, resulting in infection.' There is currently no reason to suspect that the jump is due to a change in the virus' genetic makeup or that the risk to humans is greater from infected foxes or otters than from birds. However, scientists believe close monitoring is required to detect any mutations that could make a leap between species more likely. And reports of the apparent spread of the virus between mammals on a mink farm and the possibility of an outbreak in the wild seal population have heightened concern. Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: 'While these constant incursions of the virus into mammalian species does provide an opportunity for the virus to adapt to mammalian transmission, the natural barriers to this occurring are quite high and there is no indication of spread within these species. The risk to people right now therefore appears no more than it is for direct spread from infected birds.' In a recent report, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warned that the 'rapid and consistent acquisition of the mutation in mammals may imply this virus has a propensity to cause zoonotic infections' meaning it could jump to humans. The agency also raised concerns about limited wild bird and mammal surveillance and genomic data collection in England, and warned that there was not enough testing of people who had been contact with infected birds. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) there have been almost 870 cases of human infection in the past 20 years and of these, 457 cases were fatal.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 14}, {"key": "affirm_evolve_statement_3", "statement": "Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: 'While these constant incursions of the virus into mammalian species does provide an opportunity for the virus to adapt to mammalian transmission, the natural barriers to this occurring are quite high and there is no indication of spread within these species.'"}, {"key": "affirm_humanspread_statement_4", "statement": "Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: 'While these constant incursions of the virus into mammalian species does provide an opportunity for the virus to adapt to mammalian transmission, the natural barriers to this occurring are quite high and there is no indication of spread within these species.

There have been six other cases of H5N1 reported in people since September, according to the W.H.O. The death of the 11-year-old girl this week is Cambodia's first bird flu death since 2014. Experts have been closely monitoring H5N1, especially since an outbreak on a Spanish mink farm in October suggested that the virus could spread efficiently among some mammals. Samples of the virus isolated from the mink carried a genetic mutation that is known to help flu replicate better in mammals. No human infections were detected. But a mink-adapted version of the virus might be one step closer to efficient transmission among people. If the version of H5N1 identified in Cambodia were found to be closer to the one seen in Spain than to those in previous Asian outbreaks, scientists would be concerned, Dr. Peiris said. It is important to try to understand exactly what has gone on in Cambodia, he added.

{"id": "253", "fulltext": "One of the world's largest outbreaks of bird flu, which led to the slaughter of millions of chickens to limit its spread, appears to be spilling over into mammals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the avian influenza A virus has been detected in mammals such as skunks, bears, a raccoon and a red fox. Though most cases were detected in Oregon, positive tests in mammals were confirmed in the following states, according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services: * Alaska * Colorado * Idaho * Illinois * Montana * Nebraska * New York * Washington Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, the Animal and Plant Health Agency found positive cases in otters and foxes. The agency also said a cat tested positive in France, and the highly contagious pathogen caused a large outbreak in a Spanish mink farm. AVIAN FLU: Here's why egg prices are soaring across the US How is the bird flu being transmitted? Most of these infections are probably independent cases in which a mammal eats an infected bird, said Jürgen Richt, professor and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at Kansas State University. It may be happening more often during this outbreak as viral transmission increases among wild birds, such as ducks, geese and swans. The outbreak at the Spanish mink farm could be a special case in which the virus transmitted from mammal to mammal, Richt said. What does this mean for humans? Though more research is needed, it doesn't bode well for humans. \"If this virus has mammalian adaption and can transmit between mammals, humans are immunologically naive and humans are mammals,\" Richt said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the bird flu situation remains primarily an animal health issue. Only four human infections have ever been reported in the U.S., the CDC said. Bird flu is not a foodborne illness, so poultry and eggs found in grocery stores are safe to eat, Gregory Martin, a poultry educator at Penn State Extension, told USA TODAY last month.

{"id": "254", "fulltext": "Maybe you've seen the funny internet memes about high egg prices? Like the one where a guy gets on his knees to propose, but instead of a ring, he brings out a dozen precious eggs! Well, egg prices have finally begun to decline. \"We're seeing wholesale prices start to come down,\" says David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University. The wholesale price of a dozen eggs in the midwest market dropped by 58 cents to $3.29 a dozen at the end of January, according to USDA data. There is a lag between a drop in wholesale prices and what we pay at the grocery store, Ortega says, but we can expect some relief soon. I've already seen prices fall at my local supermarket. However, the days of $1.50 a dozen may not return anytime soon. That's partly because inflation has driven up the cost of feed, transportation and labor. But the biggest factor impacting egg prices is the outbreak of bird flu — highly pathogenic avian influenza (HAPI) — which can spread quickly from flock to flock and is lethal in chickens. The CDC estimates more than 58 million birds have died or been culled because of the current outbreak. The virus has caused an acute \"shock\" to the egg supply, Ortega says. And \"there's a lot of uncertainty about how much longer this outbreak will continue.\" Amid such unpredictability, Ortega says prices are sticky. \"They tend to rise quickly, but take much longer to come down.\" Avian flu isn't new, but scientists say this current outbreak is more widespread and more lethal than the last outbreak in 2015. It's been detected in wild birds in all 50 states. Typically, wild birds don't get sick from the virus, but the strain circulating now appears more virulent. \"We're seeing symptoms and we're seeing mortality in some of the wild birds,\" says poultry scientist Phillip Clauer of Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences. \"This time around, it's more deadly,\" Clauer says. The latest CDC data shows the avian flu has been detected in a range of species, including black vultures and geese. There's also a few recent reports of infection in great-horned owls, red-tailed hawks and bald eagles. Since the avian flu began circulating last year, there have been outbreaks at poultry operations in 47 states. Outbreaks typically begin when wild birds, such as geese, infect chickens, turkeys or other waterfowl in commercial flocks or backyard flocks. Once an infection is found in any flock, the USDA euthanizes the whole flock. \"This highly pathogenic disease is very deadly,\" says Clauer. \"So the whole idea is to get on top of it and help the birds die in a humane manner and not allow the disease to continue to spread,\" he explains. In recent years farmers have stepped up biosecurity measures to protect their flocks. \"You're trying to build barriers,\" explains Clauer. For example, since the virus can spread through bird poop or feathers, workers take precautions to keep their hands, clothes and shoes clean. Tools and equipment should be disinfected, too. Farmers try to discourage waterfowl from landing in fields near their poultry houses. \"You're setting a parameter around your poultry to protect them,\" Clauer says. The virus poses a \"low risk\" to people, according to the CDC. The agency says avian flu viruses \"usually do not infect people,\" though last spring, the CDC reported the infection of one person in Colorado who had been in contact with infected poultry. The person reported fatigue and was treated with an antiviral medication. So, when will the outbreak end? \"We don't know,\" says Dr. Yuko Sato, a veterinarian at Iowa State University. \"We hope we're somewhere in the middle or hoping towards the end,\" she says. Sato says killing off infected flocks takes an emotional toll on farmers. \"Nobody likes to be, you know, depopulating, euthanizing birds,\" she says. Then, egg producers must invest in rebuilding their flocks beginning with chicks. \"It takes about somewhere between 16 to 18 weeks for birds to mature to that point to start laying eggs,\" Sato explains. So, there's a lag time to rebuild supplies of eggs. \"Our stock is still down about 5%, right now,\" explains Emily Metz, president of the American Egg Board. But she says farmers are focused on a quick recovery and they continue to invest in prevention strategies to fend off avian flu. \"I have farmers that have put in laser light systems to prevent migratory birds from landing on their barns,\" she explains. \"I have farms that are bussing in their workers to minimize truck traffic,\" and lower the risk of contamination. The hope is that these efforts make the operations more resilient. \"Egg prices are trending downward for sure,\" Metz says. \"I think there's relief in sight.\"", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 8}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "The biggest factor impacting egg prices is the outbreak of bird flu — highly pathogenic avian influenza (HAPI) — which can spread quickly from flock to flock and is lethal in chickens."}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_3", "statement": "The virus has caused an acute 'shock' to the egg supply, Ortega says."}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_5", "statement": "This highly pathogenic disease is very deadly,' says Clauer."}, {"key": "affirm_pandemic_statement_1", "statement": "The virus poses a 'low risk' to people, according to the CDC.

{"id": "255", "fulltext": "Warning comes as ornithologists call for the government to step up testing to monitor the impact of the deadly H5N1 strain. A devastating new outbreak of avian flu, which has already wiped out wild bird populations across the UK, is likely to hit Britain in the spring. That is the stark warning made last week by ornithologists who said the disease has now established itself across many parts of the country. Wild birds arriving in Britain in a couple of months are very likely to trigger new outbreaks of the disease, said Claire Smith, senior conservation officer for the RSPB. A few months ago, I was relatively optimistic about its likely impact this year but outbreaks have continued throughout winter and the outlook for 2023 now looks much grimmer. The current bird flu epidemic is caused by the H5N1 strain of virus, which originated in intensive poultry farms in Asia and has since spread round the globe, with infected migrating birds playing a pivotal role in its spread. In Britain, the disease has had a growing impact on wild birds over the past two years with 65 species being infected. About 16,000 barnacle geese died on the Solway Firth last winter, for example, while more than a quarter of the UK's only roseate tern colony, off the Northumberland coast, died in the summer. On the island of Foula, in Shetland, 1,500 great skuas perished, a number that represents 4% of the world population of these rare large birds. Similarly, thousands of birds have been reported dead at the Bass Rock, the world's largest colony of northern gannets. Britain is home to 55% of the global northern gannet population. Bird flu has also begun to kill hen harriers and white-tailed eagles. Both species are of conservation concern, added Smith. We are seeing kestrels and owls becoming infected probably because they are catching mice and voles that have picked up the virus from poultry farms. These rodents are not necessarily affected by the virus but they are carrying it. The virus has also infected otters and foxes, it was reported last week, though Smith stressed that all but one of these cases had actually occurred in 2021 or 2022. The main problem we face is that we do not know exactly how prevalent this strain of bird flu has become, said Smith. We need to do a great deal of proactive testing to find how much the virus has spread among our wild birds and the government is not doing that. The spread of avian flu puts further pressure on Britain's wild birds, particularly seabirds. Many species breed only once every four or five years but are already suffering from the effects of the climate crisis, commercial development of coastal areas and large-scale fishing of sand eels, an important source of food. It's an increasingly worrying situation, said Smith. At present, it is thought H5N1 only rarely infects people and few cases have been recorded of it being passed from one human to another. However, scientists warn there is a possibility that bird flu viruses could change and gain the ability to spread easily between people. Monitoring for human infection is extremely important, they warn.", "discarded_statements": [{"key": "affirm_count", "statement": 6}, {"key": "affirm_crisis_statement_1", "statement": "At present, it is thought H5N1 only rarely infects people and few cases have been recorded of it being passed from one human to another.

{"id": "256", "fulltext": "Eggs are getting cheaper for retailers. For consumers, they are still expensive. Wholesale prices of Midwest large eggs have declined to $2.81 a dozen, according to research firm Urner Barry, down nearly 50% from a record high of more than $5 a dozen in December, but higher than $1.30 a dozen in January 2022. Retail prices for a dozen regular eggs have stayed in the $4 range, NielsenIQ data show, and sold for $4.40 for the week ended Jan. 21. An avian-influenza outbreak has wiped out tens of millions of egg-laying hens, pushing up egg prices in recent months. The prices of eggs rose more than any other grocery item in 2022, and some supermarkets have said they lost money on eggs for weeks last year to keep prices competitive and maintain store traffic. Customers are so sensitive to the price of eggs right now, said Scott Karns, chief executive of Karns Foods in Pennsylvania. The grocer is selling large eggs for $3.39 a dozen this week after paying a wholesale price of $2.75 for them, Mr. Karns said. There is often a lag between wholesale prices—what suppliers charge—and the retail prices that consumers pay as supermarkets try to sell through the inventory they have on hand, he added. In New York, Morton Williams Supermarkets hasn't made major changes to egg prices but expects to lower them next week, said Steve Schwartz, director of sales and marketing at the grocery chain. The company has avoided adjusting prices prematurely and wanted to make sure decreases were here to stay, he said. Demand typically falls after the holiday season, during which people bake more and eat warmer breakfasts. The decline has been steep this year as high prices prompted some shoppers to buy fewer eggs. U.S. retailers sold about 10% fewer eggs for the week ended Jan. 21 compared with the same period a year ago, according to data from NielsenIQ. Retail prices will take a while to come down as food sellers will be reluctant to bring prices down, only to increase them again if another surge in bird-flu cases occurs, said Brian Earnest, a lead animal-protein economist at agricultural lender CoBank. The deadliest outbreak of avian-influenza on record has devastated poultry flocks across the U.S. since February of last year, killing about 58 million birds, including more than 43 million egg-laying chickens. The outbreak, along with higher feed, fuel and packaging costs, has helped raise egg prices since the start of last year, industry analysts said. Egg supplies are expected to remain constrained through the first three months of 2023, according to analysts from agriculture lender Rabobank. Egg producers are rebuilding their flocks faster than during previous outbreaks, according to the American Egg Board, which represents egg producers. Entire flocks of birds are killed after the disease has been detected to prevent the spread. Wendong Zhang, an agricultural economist and assistant professor at Cornell University, said the faster rebuilding of flocks will help, but prices are likely to remain higher than their historical averages as long as the bird-flu outbreak persists. We could see some reduction in prices in the immediate future, he said. If the flu comes back, we'll have some spikes again. Bird-flu cases in commercial flocks were tempered in January, with fewer than 500,000 total bird deaths compared with more than 5 million in December, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. However, USDA officials have said the virus will likely surge back during the spring migration season, when wild birds move across the country. Rosemary Sifford, the USDA's chief veterinary officer said: We expect that they will continue to be carrying it this spring.
