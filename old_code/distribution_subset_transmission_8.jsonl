Nearly 2 billion animals a year are now trucked and shipped around the world on journeys that can take weeks. We'll be exploring why this trade continues, the risk it poses to disease spread and why the EU has become such a key player. We started the series reporting on hundreds of thousands of unwanted male dairy calves due to be born in Ireland this year, where the choice may be between live export or disposing on-farm. We've also reported on the huge revenues generated by the industry, with the Middle East a key market. In 1988, the global trade in all live animals was worth $716m (£48m); by 2017 that had risen to $21bn. In 2016, Saudi Arabia alone imported almost $1bn worth of live animals, mostly sheep. If you have some expertise in this field and would like to contribute to our investigation, please get in touch via animalsfarmed@theguardian.com. News from around the world More than 800 million animals are estimated to have been killed in Australian bushfires, which have burned 10 million hectares (40,000 square miles) of land in the country. The Australian government expects that 100,000 cattle and sheep could be lost as a result of the bushfires. At least 13,120 farm animals have been euthanised or confirmed dead as a result of bushfires in New South Wales. An outbreak of the highly contagious H5N8 bird flu has been rapidly spreading across eastern Europe this month. Outbreaks have been reported in the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. French authorities culled millions of birds in an attempt to contain the last outbreak of the H5N8 virus in Europe in 2017. In China, an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N6 bird flu has been reported in swans in the western Xinjiang region of the country. A reported 180 sheep rescued from the Queen Hind cargo ship that capsized as they were being transported from Romania to Saudi Arabia are due to be resettled. More than 14,000 sheep onboard the ship died. Animal welfare groups leading the rescue of the sheep opposed sending the surviving animals on to Saudi Arabia for slaughter and are in discussions to gain custody of the sheep and resettle them in animal sanctuaries in Romania. One of Europe's largest meat producers, the Netherlands-based Vion, has said it expects the numbers of pigs and cattle in western Europe to decline by 20% over the next decade. It also expects meat consumption to fall by 1½% a year over the same period. Dutch food safety inspectors still allegedly encounter pigs drowning in hot water having not been properly killed, according to documents obtained by an animal rights group. Campaigners have called for independent camera surveillance on slaughter lines in the Netherlands. In England, all abattoirs are required to have CCTV installed. A farming minister in the German state of Lower Saxony has called for a meat tax to be introduced in the country. Meat in Germany is currently taxed at a reduced rate of 7% instead of 19%. Former environment minister Michael Gove has previously rejected the idea of introducing a meat tax in the UK.

{"id": "4", "title": "Opinion: Bird flu. SARS. China coronavirus. Is history repeating itself?", "date": "2020-01-27", "fulltext": "HONG KONG Sometimes history seems to unspool in a continuous playback loop. That is the feeling I get from watching Hongkongers donning face masks, dousing hands with sanitizer, and once again bracing for the possibility that a deadly new coronavirus outbreak originating in mainland China will spread here. Chinese authorities' delayed response, the secrecy breeding mistrust, the lack of full transparency, and efforts to control the narrative by downplaying the seriousness it all rings sadly familiar. Public health emergencies should be handled quickly, transparently, and devoid of political considerations. But public health is inherently political and, with anything involving China, politics can never be fully excised. For Chinese Communist officials, particularly at the provincial level, there is an innate tendency to cover up and conceal, their long-imbued penchant for secrecy always taking precedence over trifling concerns like promoting public awareness and advocating proper precautions. That was certainly the case in late 1997, just after China assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong, when the territory was hit by an outbreak of the H5N1 virus known as 'bird flu.' Well into the outbreak, with people sick and some dying, Hong Kong officials were reluctant to finger China as the source, even though 80% of the territory's poultry came from the mainland. Hong Kong ordered the slaughter of more than 1.3 million chickens, ducks, pigeons, and other birds, but officials were still nonsensically hesitant to point to China as the culprit behind the contagion out of fear of contradicting Beijing, which insisted strongly that all its chickens were healthy. Support STAT: STAT is offering coverage of the coronavirus for free. Please consider a subscription to support our journalism. Start free trial today. The same obfuscation and denial came from China's Communist authorities in reaction to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, also caused by a coronavirus, in late 2002 and 2003. Even as the virus spread, Chinese officials continued to undercount cases and delay reporting information to the World Health Organization. The government did not warn the public for months, allowing people carrying the virus to migrate freely, and did not alert the WHO until February 2003. China finally began concerted action in the summer of 2003 and SARS was quickly brought under control. But the inadequate reporting and delayed response led to a public health trust deficit that persists today. Like bird flu in 1997 and the SARS epidemic of 2002 to 2003, the newest coronavirus has originated in the mainland, this time in Wuhan, most likely in a market where exotic wild animals are sold. Like before, there are suspicions that in these early stages the number of confirmed cases were undercounted, underreported, or both. Like before, there were delays and denials, with Wuhan officials initially downplaying the virus as mild, treatable, and contained while dismissing the likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Those who disagreed online were questioned by police for spreading 'false rumors.' But 2020 is not 1997, nor even 2003. China's public health infrastructure and reporting system have become more reliable. Most importantly, internet use and penetration in China today makes it virtually impossible for a cover-up to last for long. Despite censorship of some news about the coronavirus including blocking foreign media websites social media platforms have been filled with debate, discussion, and questions from citizens asking what precautions they should take. State media has also made much of President Xi Jinping's instruction to local officials to open up about the number of cases and the severity of the epidemic or risk consequences. And WHO investigators and Hong Kong specialists have been allowed to visit Wuhan. Does this signal that Beijing is opting for a new policy of transparency this time? 'It's still very mixed,' said my colleague, King-wa Fu, who studies Chinese censorship patterns at the University of Hong Kong. 'We see censorship. But we also see a lot of discussion online. We'll have to wait and see.' The rapid spiral in the number of identified cases of infection with the coronavirus, and the new draconian measures taken, like effectively quarantining Wuhan at the start of the busy Lunar New Year travel period, breeds suspicion that the real picture may be far worse than officials even now admit. Even the quarantine smacks of too little, too late. It seems ill-planned, and likely to be largely ineffective. First there is the near impracticality of sealing off a city of 11 million people, larger than the populations of Hong Kong or New York City. The move was taken the day before the New Year's Eve travel period, when many people would have already started on their journeys. Planes, trains, and buses were halted, but it was unclear what provisions would be made for private cars. Perhaps most inexplicably, the ban was announced to take effect at 10 a.m. on a Thursday, creating an early-morning crush of travelers trying to get out ahead of the quarantine. Then there's the matter of whether such a closure of Wuhan could even be effective. Some public health experts I spoke with said there seems to have been no provision made for getting food, fuel, and critical supplies like medicine into the city, or how investigators, decision-makers, or even journalists would enter and whether they would then be permitted to leave. And while the closure might temporarily tamp down the geographical spread of the coronavirus apart from those residents who have already left it could also have the unintended effect of turning Wuhan into an incubator of infection. The Hong Kong government was already facing a loss of public confidence after months of protests sparked by Chief Executive Carrie Lam's botched extradition bill. Some pro-democracy lawmakers and ordinary citizens are accusing the government of dragging its feet on the virus crisis for fear of offending Beijing for example, not shutting down the West Kowloon rail terminus, and not immediately demanding arriving mainland train passengers fill out health declaration forms. Bird flu redux. For the Chinese Communist Party, which just celebrated 70 years in power, its legitimacy derives not from any election but from its performance. China's leaders base their right to rule on how effectively they have managed what is soon to be the world's largest economy. One may have thought China's leaders had learned from their errors handling SARS. Unfortunately, history teaches us otherwise, and seems to be repeating itself again. Keith B.

{"id": "5", "title": "Avian Influenza in China Adds to Economic Concerns Amid Coronavirus Spread; China pledges more support for its economy, exempts from punitive tariffs products", "date": "2020-02-01", "fulltext": "HONG KONG—Chinese authorities announced Saturday a recurrence of avian influenza in chickens in central China, adding fresh economic concerns for a country reeling from an outbreak of coronavirus that has sickened nearly 12,000 people since it emerged in December. In a sign of the pressure already on China, Australia and Vietnam joined the U.S. and others in distancing their citizens from the country over the coronavirus, while Apple Inc. shut its stores on the Chinese mainland and Beijing pledged more support for embattled businesses. The Latest on the Coronavirus * Australia orders its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days * Vietnam halts all flights to and from Taiwan and China * Apple closes all of its retail stores in mainland China until Feb. 9 * Beijing pledges more support for its economy * Avian influenza adds to concerns about economy The avian influenza is likely to add to the economic damage rather than pose a major immediate health risk. China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that a case of H5N1 avian influenza, last identified in China in April last year, had killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. But while avian influenza can be fatal in humans, with a mortality rate of 60%, according to the World Health Organization, it doesn't spread easily to humans. In addition to the coronavirus, China has been grappling with an outbreak of African swine fever that has decimated the country's pig population over the past two years. Pork is China's main source of protein, and swine fever last year pushed overall consumer inflation to the highest level in eight years. Hunan province, where the avian influenza outbreak announced on Saturday took place, neighbors Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Australia said that it would impose new entry restrictions in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, banning foreign nationals who have been in mainland China in the past 14 days from entering Australia, while Qantas Airways Ltd., the country's national carrier, said it would suspend flights to the mainland starting Feb. 9. Vietnam's civil aviation authority said it would halt all flights to and from Taiwan and China, including the special Chinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong, starting Saturday. Several countries and airlines have suspended flights to China, including Pakistan, Italy and the U.S.'s American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. The move by Australia, which also ordered its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days, to tighten entry restrictions followed a U.S. tightening. A day earlier, the U.S. said it would deny entry to foreign nationals who had traveled anywhere in China within the past 14 days and imposed quarantines on Americans returning from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. The coronavirus has killed 259 people and infected nearly 12,000 in China as of late Friday, according to the official National Health Commission in Beijing. The number of infected patients in China alone now exceeds the global total for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed nearly 800 people after emerging from southern China in 2002 and 2003. Authorities in Beijing pledged more support for the economy in a bid to reassure investors before markets reopen on Monday. Companies and industries in regions hit particularly hard by the outbreak, including those that provide medical supplies, could get reduced lending rates, the central bank said in a joint statement with other government agencies, including the Finance Ministry and the banking regulator. China's cabinet said separately that products imported from the U.S. to control the outbreak will be exempt from punitive tariffs through March 31. Authorities also exempted tariffs and other taxes on products donated by overseas entities, according to a joint statement by the Finance Ministry and the customs agency. Resources are strained in Hubei province, and medical staff have been forced to turn away patients because of a lack of beds and basic medical supplies. Local authorities in Huanggang, a city about 35 miles east of Wuhan, imposed new restrictions on residents' movements, saying only one person per household in the city center would be allowed to go out every two days to purchase basic necessities. Apple is closing all of its retail stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb. 9 'out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts,' it said. The company operates more than 40 stores in China. North Korea said through its state media that it would send an aid fund to Chinese authorities, a rare extension of aid from Pyongyang. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, 'expressed deep consolation for the families who lost their blood relatives due to the infectious disease,' according to a report in Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency. North Korea—a close ally of China that has long been dependent on China's largess—was among the first countries to adopt stringent measures to keep the coronavirus outside its borders, and vowed to redouble its efforts. 'The novel coronavirus throws the world into uneasiness and horror, but the advantages and might of our state system—will be fully demonstrated to the whole world once again, when we ensure that the virus does not reach our country and that no one suffers from the infections,' it read.

{"id": "6", "title": "Industry scrambles to stop fatal bird flu in South Carolina", "date": "2020-04-10", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — An infectious and fatal strain of bird flu has been confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in South Carolina, the first case of the more serious strain of the disease in the United States since 2017 and a worrisome development for an industry that was devastated by previous outbreaks. The high pathogenic case was found at an operation in Chesterfield County, South Carolina, marking the first case of the more dangerous strain since one found in a Tennessee chicken flock in 2017. In 2015, an estimated 50 million poultry had to be killed at operations mainly in the Upper Midwest after infections spread throughout the region. “Yes, it’s concerning when we see cases, but we are prepared to respond very quickly and that was done in this case,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The USDA has been working in recent months with scientists and farmers in North Carolina and South Carolina, where a low pathogenic — or less severe — strain of bird flu had been detected. Low pathogenic bird flu causes few clinical signs in infected birds. However, two strains of low pathogenic bird flu — the H5 and H7 strains — can mutate into highly pathogenic forms, which are frequently fatal to birds and easily transmissible between susceptible species. Low pathogenic cases were already in an area near the South Carolina and North Carolina state line and USDA was closely monitoring and testing. The case in Chesterfield County, South Carolina was expected to be another low pathogenic case, but it came back from the laboratory high pathogenic which means the less severe virus mutated into the more severe version, Cole said. “Our scientists at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory had looked at the virus characteristics of the low path virus and they had previously indicated that this was one that was probably likely to mutate so they were watching it very closely,” Cole said. A laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the virus that had been killing turkeys was a high pathogenic H7N3 strain of avian influenza. A report on the outbreak indicates it was discovered on April 6. It has killed 1,583 turkeys and the remainder of the 32,577 birds in the flock were euthanized. State officials quarantined the farm, movement controls were implemented and enhanced surveillance was already in place in the area. “The flock was quickly depopulated and will not enter the marketplace,” said Joel Brandenberger, president of the National Turkey Federation, an industry trade group. “Thorough disinfecting and cleaning procedures have already been initiated on premises as well as surveillance of commercial flocks in the surrounding area. This occurrence poses no threat to public health. Turkey products remain safe and nutritious.” He said poultry farmers implement strict biosecurity measures year-round and routinely test flocks for avian influenza. These measures were implemented after an H5N2 avian influenza outbreak that began in December 2014 swept commercial chicken, egg laying and turkey populations throughout much of 2015 killing 50 million birds and causing as much as $3 billion in economic damage. That outbreak is believed to have originated in wild birds. Nearly 90 percent of the bird losses were on egg-laying chicken farms in Iowa and turkey farms in Minnesota. The bulk of other cases occurred in the adjacent states of Nebraska, Wisconsin, and South Dakota. Cole said since 2015 significant planning, exercises and coordination has occurred between the federal government, state agencies and the industry. Cole said the coronavirus pandemic has not affected the ability of the government to respond to the bird flu. A highly pathogenic H7N9 bird flu strain was detected in Lincoln County, Tennessee, in a chicken flock of 73,500 birds in early March 2017. Ten days later samples from a commercial flock less than two miles away also tested positive for the same strain. The birds were euthanized and buried and the virus didn’t spread further indicating immediate mitigation action can stop spread.", "media_outlet": "AP", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "7", "title": "Avian Flu Fast Facts", "date": "2024-06-05", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Here's a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds. There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called 'Influenza A (H5N1),' or the 'H5N1 virus.' Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu. The mortality rate is close to 60% for infected humans. Timeline Early 1900s -The avian flu is first identified in Italy. 1961 - The H5N1 strain is isolated in birds in South Africa.

{"id": "8", "title": "You got it': how bird flu turned one US farmer's life upside down", "date": "2020-09-17", "fulltext": "Greg Langmo's decades-old business was among those hit when a lethal strain decimated poultry barns across America. In April 2015, Greg Langmo's five turkey farms teemed with toms, hens and chicks. His family's decades-old business in Meeker county, Minnesota, was thriving, and the hundreds of thousands of birds he bred and sold each year were healthy. And then, late one evening, Langmo's phone rang. Birds in one of his barns, usually active, were sitting, unable to make the short walk to their feeders and waterers. The following morning, he found hundreds of limp, white-feathered bodies. Langmo sent some dead toms to the University of Minnesota's veterinary diagnostic laboratory. That night, the farmer lay sleepless. Again, his phone rang. It was a vet from the lab: 'You got it.' Langmo's farms had been hit by the Eurasian/North American H5N2 strain of lethal avian influenza, which, along with another lethal strain, Eurasian H5N8, rampaged across poultry farms in the American west and midwest between December 2014 and June 2015. A third strain, Eurasian/North American H5N1, was detected in nearly 100 wild birds by US wildlife biologists. It was the first time a foreign strain of bird flu H5N8 had entered North America and mixed with mild bird flu viruses. It's one of many lethal bird flu outbreaks to kill billions of birds and cost billions of dollars over the past hundred years. Such losses are part of the reality of farming today. Lethal avian influenza's advent is strongly linked to the development of modern agriculture, which created a global network of disease incubators—industrial farms in some parts of the world, live animal markets in others—linked by trading routes, movement of labourers and equipment, and migration of wild birds. Critical diagnosis Soon after the diagnosis, says Langmo, 'the rest of the birds began dying by the bushel.' To stop the spread, Langmo and his employees killed survivors with a swift crack to the back of the head. Within three days, virtually all 11,000 toms in the infected barn were dead. Then they moved into the other barns. Workers from the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) arrived and doused any live birds with water-based foam, an asphyxiant used to mass-euthanise poultry in emergencies only. Foam flowed across the floors, bubbling like a choppy sea, the turkeys beneath it gasping for air. Fifteen minutes later, all were dead. Only other poultry farmers will know the helpless feeling of losing a great flock of birds, Greg Langmo reflected. He lost 225,000 turkeys across five farms. Langmo was one of 211 American commercial poultry farmers who battled bird flu during the 2014-15 outbreak, the worst the $40bn (£1bn) US poultry industry has experienced. Twenty-one flocks on backyard farms were diagnosed and destroyed. Nationwide, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys died from the virus or were killed to control it. American commercial poultry farmers lost about $1.6bn. The US poultry industry lost an estimated $3.3bn. 'This outbreak was arguably the most significant animal health event in US history,' says Dr Julie Gauthier, assistant director for poultry health at USDA-APHIS. Deadly history Lethal bird flu, originally 'fowl plague,' was first diagnosed on Italian farms in 1878. While poultry die-offs reported before 1878 may have been bird flu, this was the first time scientists distinguished the virus from bacterial poultry diseases, such as fowl cholera. Subsequent research revealed that bird flu is an influenza-A virus. These viruses are rarely lethal and often mildly afflict their natural hosts. But lethal influenza-A viruses, which mutate in and emerge from the bodies of domesticated animals, are known to infect and kill not just poultry, but birds, horses, swine, bats, dogs and even humans. The emergence and coexistence of three hybrid lethal bird flu strains—H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8—in the US during the 2014-2015 pandemic underscores the ability of influenza-A viruses to rapidly mix, transform, infect and persist. Lethal bird flu viruses have emerged more frequently as poultry farms have expanded capacities and quickened animal-rearing rates over the past 50 years. In the 37 years from 1959 to 1995, these viruses emerged 14 times globally, about one outbreak every 2.6 years; while in the 13 years from 1996 to 2008, they arose 11 times, about one outbreak every 1.2 years. These species don't mix Scientists and farmers are divided over the best way forward. In terms of prevention, should birds be kept inside, which would reduce potential contact with wild birds? Should large-scale movement of animals (industrial farming depends on the transportation of large populations of birds after breeding and for slaughter) be scaled down? That is one of the key vectors by which the disease may be spread. Some regions of the world look to good farm hygiene and high levels of biosecurity, where infected birds are confined and killed to eradicate disease; others, particularly in countries with many outdoor industrial farms, struggle with implementing biosecurity and may lack available veterinary care, so they allow diseases to circulate, using vaccines to reduce illness and mortality. 'Vaccines do not prevent birds from becoming infected with the avian influenza virus or from producing and shedding the virus into the environment,' says Gauthier, adding that up until now culling birds was the preferred solution in the US. Constant threat Gene Baur, president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary, a UK-based animal protection organisation, believes that establishing a network of small farms serving local communities is one powerful possibility, because it reduces the need for transporting animals, farm labourers and equipment. Scientists are recognising the benefits of giving birds more space—research shows chickens stressed by overcrowded living conditions typical to commercial farms have diminished immunity to disease. After a major avian influenza outbreak in Thailand from 2004 to 2005, experts determined that industrial farms were more likely to be infected than backyard farms. In the Netherlands, after a 2003 outbreak, scientists suggested that thinning commercial flocks could prevent the next epidemic. When you confine animals in these filthy conditions they become breeding grounds for disease, Gene Baur, Farm Sanctuary, says. 'When you confine animals in these filthy, crowded, stressful conditions, just like humans, they become breeding grounds for disease,' says Baur. After considering his financial losses from the 2014-2015 pandemic, Langmo spent a year rebuilding his business, downsizing from five farms to two. He says he's boosted biosecurity by cutting cross-traffic, checking birds' health more frequently and improving sanitation with routine deep-cleanings. 'After a thorough sanitisation, each barn literally needs to be as clean as your kitchen, no feathers, no nothing,' says Langmo. 'It's very expensive.'

{"id": "11", "title": "UK bird flu outbreaks prompt tough new restrictions on farms", "date": "2020-11-12", "fulltext": "Farmers found to be breaching new biosecurity rules face unlimited fines or three month prison sentence Poultry keepers across England, Scotland and Wales are facing tough new lockdown-style measures on their farms to control the spread of bird flu. It follows outbreaks of a highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of bird flu in Cheshire, Devon, Gloucestershire and Hertfordshire over the past two weeks. The outbreaks have been found in wild bird populations and two broiler chicken farms, where all the birds are being culled. Farmers are required to restrict access for non-essential people, remove sources of wild bird food and ensure workers are regularly disinfecting footwear and changing clothes. Those found to not be complying face up to three months in prison or unlimited fines, according to the measures announced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). UK and European farmers have been on alert after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. When bird flu was detected in the same area of Russia in the summers of 2005 and 2016, epidemics followed in northern and eastern Europe. However, the speed of the spread of outbreaks in Europe over the past few weeks has caught the industry by surprise, with hundreds of thousands of birds culled after multiple outbreaks across Germany and the Netherlands. Thousands of dead wild birds were also reportedly found on the north-west coast of Germany last week, most likely infected with bird flu. British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said bird flu was a significant threat to the commercial poultry industry and he supported new restrictive measures to minimise the risk of a larger and wider outbreak. It is an incredibly difficult situation for farmers and producers if they get a case of avian influenza (AI), so the controls and their costs are made to be as fair as they can be. For instance, farmers are compensated for the culling of healthy birds as part of AI controls. The system is as fair as it possibly can be, given the nature of the situation. During the last significant bird flu outbreak in 2016/17, there was also a ban on keeping poultry outdoors. Defra said this was not being considered at present, but would be if the outbreak spread further. Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and that properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. PHE said: Our advice regarding contact with wild birds remains the same make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after coming into contact with any animal and do not touch any sick or dead birds.

{"id": "12", "title": "Bird flu fears grow after spate of mysterious UK swan deaths", "date": "2020-11-27", "fulltext": "Virus causing high levels of mortality in birds, with risk to chickens and other poultry A spate of baffling swan deaths is strongly suspected to be caused by a virulent new strain of avian flu sweeping across Britain. Dying swans were found spinning in circles and discharging blood from their nostrils on Ulverston canal, Cumbria. Swan rescuers have taken in more than 25 dying birds in Worcestershire and nine swans were found dead in Stanley Park, Blackpool. Postmortem examinations have confirmed that six black swans and cygnets that died in Dawlish, Devon, had contracted the latest strain of bird flu, H5N8. Brought in by wild birds migrating across Europe, the strain last caused widespread avian deaths in the winter of 2016-17. The risk to human health from the virus is very low, according to Public Health England. Fears are growing that the virus will wipe out chickens and other poultry this winter, with outbreaks already confirmed among captive birds in Kent, Cheshire, Leicestershire, and chickens at a broiler breeding farm in Herefordshire. The government has declared an avian influenza prevention zone across England, Scotland and Wales, requiring all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures. While the virus is particularly visible in swans and large wildfowl, other wild bird deaths confirmed this month include pink-footed geese, greylag geese, Canada geese, buzzards and curlews. Dr Ruth Cromie, a research fellow at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, said: 'Wild birds are often seen as evil vectors, but they are victims of a virus which originally spread from poultry. Wild birds get used as scapegoats for poor biosecurity and people moving chickens around the globe.' She said avian flu, like all influenza viruses, regularly mutates, and there are either genetic or environmental factors making it particularly pathogenic this year. The virus disrupts the nervous system and can cause neurological symptoms in birds, such as head-twitching, stumbling and swimming in circles. Cromie added: 'We can be sure it is causing high levels of mortality this year.' Caroline Sim, of Flying Free, a volunteer operation to protect and rescue swans in Ulverston, said she had never seen such strange symptoms in the family of 10 swans there that died of bird flu. 'Many of them started to spin on their axis in one direction. It was terrible to see. Some of them were discharging from their nostrils and some of it was bloody,' she said. The dead birds were collected by officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to be tested. David Cash, of Worcester Swan Rescue, said about 25 swans had died. 'The swans were looking lethargic and not wanting food, and doing a lot of coughing – similar to the symptoms of Covid.' The government's prevention zone obliges all bird keepers to take measures to discourage mixing between captive and wild birds, such as feeding and watering their birds in enclosed areas, and removing wild bird food sources from around captive birds. Experts noticed an unusually high level of avian flu in Russia during the summer, and this has been spread across Europe by wild species, such as swans and geese, during their westward migration for the winter. Christine Middlemiss, the UK chief veterinary officer, repeated the Food Standards Agency advice that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for consumers. She added: 'Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to meet enhanced biosecurity requirements and this is in your interests to do, to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.' Cromie said that while improving biosecurity was the best short-term solution, the authorities should be looking at how these viruses originate in and are amplified by industrial meat production. Britain slaughters more than 1 billion chickens every year. She said: 'We should not be looking to put every chicken in a house, but asking: do we really need to have that many chickens? We're creating these nutty industrialised production systems that create a variety of health problems.'", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

Millions of free-range hens and other birds will have to be kept indoors from 14 December, in a national government crackdown to try to limit the spread of a virulent strain of avian flu across Great Britain. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a statement that the chief vets of England, Scotland and Wales had agreed the new legal requirement for all birdkeepers to bring their flocks indoors, to keep them separate from potentially infectious wild birds. The strict new lockdown-style measures, which have already been introduced in the Netherlands, apply not only to large commercial poultry farms but also smaller keepers with hens in coops or garden pens. Keepers are being urged to use the next 11 days to prepare for the new measures, including taking steps to safeguard animal welfare, consult their vet and where necessary erect additional housing or self-contained netted areas. Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as free-range for 16 weeks after the birds have been brought indoors, but if the restrictions last beyond that they must be downgraded to barn produced using stickers on packaging. Similarly, poultry meat can be labelled free-range for 12 weeks. To be defined as free range in the UK, a chicken must normally be at least 56 days old before slaughter and have had access to outside space for at least half that time. Premium free-range eggs currently represent 56% of UK retail egg sales – the highest proportion of any European country – whereas just 2% of eggs are from the barn system. Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser with the National Farmers' Union, urged all farmers to comply with the new rules. Due to a number of confirmed avian influenza cases, the introduction of these new housing measures is a logical next step to best protect poultry. These new measures mean that every poultry keeper, whether you have one hen in the garden or a large poultry business, must house their birds indoors and I would urge everyone with poultry to take these measures seriously. It's crucial that everyone remains vigilant and reports any signs of disease in their birds at the earliest opportunity. On Sunday, all 10,500 turkeys at a farm in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, were culled after an outbreak was spotted on Saturday, while a 3km (2-mile) and 10km temporary control zone was put in place to stop the disease spreading. About 13,500 birds were culled earlier this month following confirmation of an avian flu outbreak at a commercial farm in Helsby, near Frodsham in Cheshire. Defra reiterated that the risk to human health and food safety from the virus was very low. UK and European farmers have been on alert after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. In a joint statement, Great Britain's three chief vets said: We have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease and are now planning to introduce a legal requirement for bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds. We have not taken this decision lightly, but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease. A spokesman for the British Egg Industry Council said: To date there have been no cases of avian flu in free-range laying flocks; however it is vital that we continue to protect the health and welfare of the UK's laying flock and commercial poultry operations. The requirement to keep birds inside from 14 December is a further step to those already taken to continue to protect flocks. It is the first time in four years that a so-called housing order has been imposed on the UK poultry sector due to a significant outbreak of bird flu, when measures were put in place from December 2016 to May 2017.

It applies not only to large commercial poultry farms but also smaller farmers with hens in coops or garden pens. Lockdown and the shift towards 'self-sufficiency' has triggered a huge surge in interest by individuals in keeping birds and there is concern that many may have scant regard or understanding of the importance of biosecurity measures. The restrictions will apply to chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants. No end date for the measures has yet been given, and Defra said they would be kept under 'regular review.' Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as 'free-range' for 16 weeks from today, but if restrictions last longer they must be downgraded to 'barn produced' using stickers on packaging.

Among commercial producers preparing for the new restrictions is Alastaire Brice, who runs Havensfield Happy Hens—currently with 160,000 laying hens in 22 flocks across farms in Norfolk and Suffolk. The current lockdown comes as no surprise, Brice told the East Anglian Daily Times: 'It's expected, bearing in mind the sporadic cases that have been going on up and down the country. Last year, they had a reprieve when bird flu didn't arrive in the country but this year it started with a bang.' It can take longer to get older flocks to adjust to coming indoors, he explained, with hens vulnerable to anxiety or aggression. Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said: 'While contingency plans are in place and the spread of bird flu is being effectively monitored, the combination of avian influenza, the coronavirus pandemic, and a tight, non-negotiable Brexit deadline, has proven yet again the vulnerability of Britain's food security.'", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

He said the infected birds were culled and authorities have carried out medical examinations of people who were in contact with them. The virus, which is mainly spread through contact with infected animals, can cause severe illness or death in humans. Egypt suffered a major outbreak of bird flu in 2006 that led to the suspension of all poultry exports. Authorities have been pressing to renew them, and earlier this year, the World Organization for Animal Health, an intergovernmental body, had declared Egypt free of bird flu for the first time in 14 years. The H5N1 strain of bird flu spread in early 2000s in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, leading to the slaughter of tens of millions of chickens and ducks. Hundreds of people were infected, many of whom died, according to the World Health Organization. Egypt is at high risk because many of its poultry farms are in residential areas. Many Egyptians also raise pigeons and chickens at home to supplement their income. Even in dense urban areas, birds are kept on rooftops, balconies and courtyards.

The country's Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying issued an alert on Wednesday, urging states to take measures to avoid any further spread of the disease. The southern state of Kerala ordered the culling of more than 38,000 poultry birds on Tuesday after reports of dead birds infected with the disease emerged in two districts, according to the state's Minister for Animal Husbandry, K. Raju. \"Nineteen rapid response teams have been formed for this,\" Raju said. About 17,000 birds have been culled in Kerala so far, and eggs have also been destroyed in some districts. The northern state of Himachal Pradesh reported the death of more than 3,000 birds from the disease, mostly bar-headed geese at a wildlife sanctuary, according to Archana Sharma, a senior official in the state forest department. \"The birds affected are migratory birds. All we can do is follow the strategy of clearing up the area of contamination. We comb the entire area of the sanctuary and we physically send 10 teams every day who search for any dead birds and dispose of them,\" Sharma said. The alert comes as India continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 10.3 million people in the country, and is about to embark on one of the most ambitious mass vaccination programs ever undertaken. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually only affects birds. There are many different strains, but the most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called Influenza A (H5N1), or the H5N1 virus. In India, the disease spreads mostly through migratory birds entering the country during the winter season. Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. There have been no reports of avian flu transmitting to people in India so far during this outbreak. \"There is no need to panic,\" Minister of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Giriraj Singh, told public service broadcaster Doordarshan on Wednesday. \"We also provide compensation to farmers for the birds that have to be culled.\" Other countries in Asia have also experienced outbreaks of bird flu this winter.

New clusters are constantly emerging,\" the head of France's CIFOQ federation of foie gras producers, Marie-Pierre Pe, told Agence France-Presse. The number of outbreaks in France had now risen to 124, the ministry of agriculture said on Thursday, adding that about 350,000 ducks had been slaughtered since 24 December. Earlier this week the government's chief veterinary officer, Loic Evain, said more than 200,000 ducks had already been slaughtered and that a further 400,000 birds were set to be culled, out of about 35 million reared each year. He described the virus, which is not harmful to humans, as \"very, very contagious.\" Officials in Belgium said on Thursday they had culled three contaminated poultry flocks: one in Menin, in the west of the country, another in Dinant in the south and a third in Dixmude in western Flanders. Belgium's federal food safety agency AFSCA, which has ordered poultry owners to lock up their animals to avoid contamination, said that 20 cases of the virus had been found in wild birds. Herve Dupouy, a French producer who heads the local poultry section of the FNSEA farmers federation in the Landes department, a bastion of the foie gras industry, said \"The situation is out of control.\" He called on the state to cull all poultry flocks in the area and impose a two-month production freeze. \"There's no other solution,\" he said. So far the authorities have been culling all ducks and geese within a three-kilometre radius of an infected flock. Free-range chickens and turkeys within that range have also been slaughtered. CIFOQ said on Thursday that government officials had shared plans to expand the culls over a wider area. The bird flu clusters have been detected on poultry farms and in pet shops in the Landes department and the neighbouring Gers and Pyrenees-Atlantique departments. The head of France's chamber of agriculture, Sebastien Windsor, called on Wednesday for \"radical measures\" to try to restore confidence in export markets such as China which announced this week it was suspending French poultry imports over the virus. Producers of foie gras, a pate made from the livers of force-fed ducks or geese, fear a repeat of the devastation wrought by two previous waves of bird flu in the winters of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. More than 25m ducks were culled in the first outbreak, followed by 4.5m the following year, causing a steep decline in foie gras production. Besides France and Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain and Ireland have also reported bird flu outbreaks since the winter began. Dutch authorities culled 190,000 chickens in November after the discovery of the virus at two farms. Outbreaks have also been reported in India and South Korea. In India, tens of thousands of poultry will be slaughtered after an outbreak of deadly avian influenza was found to have killed scores of birds across the country. At least six Indian states have stepped up efforts this week to contain two strains of bird flu H5N1 and H5N8 after the deaths of thousands of migratory birds, ducks, crows and chickens. South Korea's agriculture ministry said on Thursday that it had so far culled 14.9m poultry since identifying its first farm-linked, highly pathogenic bird flu case in late November.

There is no evidence of the strain being transmitted between humans, but Russia has reported the transmission to the World Health Organization. The workers now feel well, and the situation did not develop further according to Dr Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor. She said the workers had been infected during an outbreak of the strain at the plant. Outbreaks of the strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East and north Africa in recent months, but only in poultry. Other strains of bird flu, including H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2, have been transmitted to humans before. The H5N8 strain is deadly for birds, and this marks the first transmission of the strain from animals to humans. While Popova said the strain didn’t appear to be able to spread among humans, only time will tell how soon future mutations will allow it to overcome this barrier. The discovery of this strain gives us all, the whole world, time to prepare for possible mutations and the possibility to react in a timely way and develop test systems and vaccines, she said. The Vector Institute in Siberia said on Saturday that it would start developing human tests and a vaccine against H5N8, according to RIA news agency. Speaking on state TV, Popova said that Russia had reported the developments to the WHO several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results. Most cases of human bird flu infections have been linked to direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered safe. The cases tend to be spread via migrating wild birds, leading producing countries to keep their poultry indoors or segregated from wildlife. Outbreaks of bird flu often lead poultry plants to kill their birds to prevent the virus spreading further, and often prompts other countries to impose trade restrictions. In the UK, five outbreaks of the H5N8 strain in Gloucestershire, Dorset, Devon, Cheshire and Kent were detected in November, leading officials to implement a prevention zone in England, Scotland and Wales.

The reported cases were workers exposed to bird flocks, according to preliminary information, the statement added. The workers were 'asymptomatic and no onward human to human transmission was reported,' the spokesperson said. Speaking during a televised briefing on Saturday, Anna Popova, the head of Russia's Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing, said that the strain had been detected in seven poultry farm workers in the south of the country, state-run news agency TASS reported. While still not confirmed by the WHO, the Russian health authority has said it is in discussion with national authorities to gather more information and 'assess the public health impact' of the incident.

{"id": "20", "title": "A New Bird Flu Jumps to Humans. So Far, It� Not a Problem.", "date": "2021-04-21", "fulltext": "Covid fuels the current virus pandemic, but the world is full of flu viruses waiting in the wings. And they keep changing unpredictably. When a bird flu virus struck a major poultry farm in Russia earlier this year, it was a reminder that the coronavirus causing the pandemic was not the only dangerous virus out there. The authorities quickly tested the birds and moved into high gear, killing 800,000 chickens, disposing of the carcasses and cleaning the farm to stop the potential spread to other chicken farms. But they were also concerned for humans. They tested the birds and sequenced the virus, determining that it was the H5N8 strain of avian flu, highly dangerous to both wild and domestic birds. It is established in Asia and has been increasingly causing deadly outbreaks in birds in Europe. H5N8 viruses have infected some poultry flocks in the United States, but the viruses come from a different though related lineage of virus, distinct from the current H5N8 viruses in Asia and Europe. Flu viruses combine and mutate frequently in unpredictable ways. In the short period from Dec. 25, 2020, to Jan. 14 of this year, more than seven million birds were lost to H5N8 outbreaks in Europe and Asia. Europe alone had 135 outbreaks among poultry and 35 among wild birds. Of course, to put the numbers in context, humans consume about 65 billion chickens each year, and one estimate puts the number of chickens on the globe at any one time at 23 billion. As damaging as H5N8 has been to birds, it had never infected people. Until February. The Russian health authorities also tested about 200 of the people involved in the cleanup of the farm in Astrakhan, using nasal swabs and later blood tests for antibodies. They reported that for the first time, H5N8 had jumped to people. Seven of the workers appeared to have been infected with the virus, although none of them became ill. Only one of those seven cases, however, was confirmed by genetically sequencing the virus. Nonetheless, the potential danger of the new virus and its jump to humans set off alarm bells for Dr. Daniel R. Lucey, a physician and a specialist in pandemics at Georgetown University. He began writing about the Astrakhan event in a blog for other infectious disease experts as soon as it was publicized. He reported that during a television interview, a Russian public health official said the H5N8 virus was likely to evolve into human-to-human transmission. That possibility was frightening. 'The W.H.O. finally put out a report Feb. 26,' he said. But it did not frame the event as particularly alarming because the virus was not causing human disease, and the report judged the risk of human-to-human transmission as low, despite the Russian official's comment. To Dr. Lucey, no one else seemed to be taking the infection of humans with H5N8 as 'of any concern.' He added, 'I think it's of concern.' Other scientists said they were not as worried. Dr. Florian Krammer, a flu researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, said he was more concerned about other avian flu viruses like H5N1 that have already shown themselves to be dangerous to people. Another avian influenza virus, H7N9, infected people for the first time in 2013. There have been more than 1,500 confirmed cases and more than 600 deaths since then. Since 2017 there have been only three confirmed cases and the virus does not jump easily from person to person. It is always possible that any virus can evolve human-to-human transmission, as well as become more dangerous. But H5N8 would have both hurdles to jump. Compared to other viral threats, Dr. Krammer said, 'I'm not worried.' Dr. Richard J. Webby, a flu specialist at the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and director of the W.H.O.'s Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that all of the H5 viruses are of concern because some of them have infected and killed people. But, he said, 'They all have the same sort of binding capacity to human cells, which is limited,' he said. Flu viruses use a slightly different way to attach to cells in birds than to cells in humans and being good at one usually means not being good at the other. Dr. Webby also said that while seven infections would certainly be of concern, only one infection has been confirmed. The tests of the other six involved nasal swabs and blood antibody tests. In people with no symptoms, he said, nasal swabs can simply indicate that they had breathed in virus. That would not mean it had infected them. Blood antibody tests also have a potential for error, he said, and may not be able to distinguish exposure to one flu virus from another. Nor did he see any scientific basis for suggesting that H5N8 is more likely than any other bird flu to evolve human-to-human transmission. But any virus could evolve that ability. Dr. Lucey said that he was heartened to see that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had prepared a candidate vaccine for H5N8 before it had infected humans. Candidate vaccines are simply first steps in planning for potential problems, and have not been through any testing. They exist for many viruses. 'Humans should be routinely tested for the virus, right at the time of the outbreak in birds,' Dr. Lucey said. He favors the protocol followed in Astrakhan, and argues that for any outbreak among birds, public health authorities should test people who are exposed to sick birds with nasopharyngeal swabs and an antibody test, followed by other antibody tests a few weeks later. An upcoming editorial in the journal Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease also takes up the Astrakhan incident and calls for increased monitoring of all H5 viruses.

But unlike with coronaviruses, there are global influenza surveillance systems that watch for human cases of bird flu, since a strain named H5N1 cropped up in the late 1990s in Hong Kong’s crowded live-poultry markets. Between 2013 and 2017, another bird flu named H7N9 infected more than 1,500 people in China through close contact with infected chickens.

The 41-year-old man from Jiangsu province, located northwest of Shanghai, was hospitalized April 28 after developing fever and other symptoms. He was diagnosed with the infection on May 28, according to Reuters, but is now stable and ready to be discharged from the hospital. The health commission said the infection was a result of accidental cross-species transmission. The risk of widespread transmission is low, Chinese officials said, and there are no other human cases of H10N3 reported elsewhere in the world. Avian influenza Type A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds and have been found in more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While these viruses don't normally infect humans, birds can shed virus in their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC says. Human infections can occur if enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth. The CDC says two strains of bird flu viruses have been mostly responsible for human infection and mortality: H7N9 and H5N1. Symptoms of avian influenza A virus infections can range from mild to severe and include conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness such as fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches. Symptoms can also be accompanied by nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and severe respiratory illness, according to the CDC. While it's possible for some of these viruses to jump from birds to humans, they so far don't have the capability of transmitting between humans, said Jürgen Richt, a professor at Kansas State University and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases with the National Institutes of Health. Alpha, Beta, Delta: WHO renames COVID-19 variants with Greek letter names to avoid confusion, stigma COVID origins: Biden tells intelligence agencies to step up probe of COVID-19's origins, including theory of Wuhan lab leak 'This is our biggest fear,' said Richt, who also directs the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases for the Department of Homeland Security. 'If they were to transmit human to human, then we would be at a worse situation than COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates.' This is because bird flu strains can be particularly deadly among human populations. According to the World Health Organization, the case-fatality rate of H7N9 is roughly 30%; H5N1 is 60%. It may be unlikely the H10N3 strain can transmit between humans, Richt said, but scientists can't know for sure until they learn its genetic code and conduct epidemiological surveillance to determine if any other contacts were infected. 'The reason for that is that avian influenza viruses spread among avian species using different receptors than mammalian influenza viruses,' he said. 'In order for these viruses to transmit (among humans), the virus needs to adapt. There're several adaptation steps and, so far, this has not happened with avian flu viruses.'

In a statement, China's National Health Commission emphasized that there was no evidence that the strain had the ability to spread among humans, adding that the risk of a significant outbreak was 'very low.' The patient, a 41-year-old man who lives in the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalized April 28 after having fever symptoms, the National Health Commission said. He was diagnosed with H10N3 a month later. Though the man remains under medical supervision, his condition was described as stable and meeting the standards for discharge. It was not clear from the statement how he caught the virus. The news of the H10N3 infection comes amid the devastation of the covid-19 pandemic, which also was first identified in China and is widely thought to have come to humans from bats through some form of zoonotic spread. A different strain of bird flu, known as H7N9, led to the deaths of around 300 people during an outbreak between 2016 and 2017. But varieties of avian influenza are common in China and, due to increased surveillance of the viruses, relatively easy to find in humans. Unlike in H7N9, there is no evidence that H10N3 can spread easily among humans.

{"id": "27", "title": "What Is Going on With Bird Flu? China Reports First Human Case of H10N3 Strain", "date": "2021-06-04", "fulltext": "Chinese health authorities said a 41-year-old man had contracted a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3 and had been in the hospital since late April, calling it the first reported human case globally from the strain. The National Health Commission said the man developed a fever and other symptoms on April 23 and was admitted to hospital in Jiangsu province five days later. On Tuesday the health commission said his condition was stable and indicated he was ready to be discharged. How did the man become infected? The health commission didn't give details on how the man came into contact with the virus. Cases of bird flu in humans have most commonly been reported among those in close daily contact with poultry, such as chicken farmers. The commission advised the public to avoid contact with sick and dead poultry. Can bird flu kill people? Avian influenza can be fatal in humans. Highly pathogenic strains, such as H5N1, can have a mortality rate of about 60%, according to the World Health Organization. However, the WHO says, bird flu doesn't spread easily from birds to people. How common are bird-flu outbreaks in China? China has seen several outbreaks of bird flu, including one at the height of the coronavirus outbreak last year, when H5N1 avian influenza killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. In May, China's Agriculture Ministry said the H5N8 strain of bird flu killed hundreds of wild birds in Tibet, prompting authorities to disinfect areas including a national wetland park. Are authorities worried? China said the risk of a large-scale outbreak was extremely low. It said local health authorities' contact-tracing and monitoring efforts had found no other cases and no human-to-human transmission. It said the H10N3 strain doesn't have the ability to effectively infect humans. What do experts say? Human infections with bird-flu viruses are rare but not uncommon, said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, a professor at the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. 'It is highly likely that this infection just represents one of the rare incidents of human infection with an avian influenza virus, without any more consequences,' said Prof. Garcia-Sastre. 'Nevertheless, it's important to make sure that this is just that, a rare isolated incident.' The fact that the case happened in April and there hasn't been any other reports of cases suggests there hasn't been a cluster of infections, says Peng Shifang, a professor of infectious diseases at Central South University in China's Hunan province. Is China upfront about the recent bird-flu case? China said it had determined on May 28 through genome sequencing that the man suffered from the H10N3 strain. It issued its statement on the results on Tuesday. While China has been criticized for a lack of transparency in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, its public-health apparatus is generally seen as having become more transparent since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, when official secrecy hampered the response.

A bird flu prevention zone has been declared across Great Britain to stop the spread of the disease among poultry and other birds. Since 5pm on Wednesday, all bird keepers have been legally required to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks. On Wednesday a flock of poultry was culled near Dundee in Scotland after a bird flu outbreak. Earlier this week cases were detected in wild birds and poultry in Wrexham, Wales. The disease has been detected in wild birds at multiple sites across Great Britain. Bird flu circulates naturally among wild birds, and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe in winter the disease can be spread to poultry and other captive birds. In advice published on the Defra website, UK health agencies and food standards agencies say the risk to public health from the virus is very low. According to the NHS, bird flu can affect humans in rare cases if people touch infected birds, their droppings or bedding, or while preparing infected poultry for cooking. Under the prevention zone, people with more than 500 birds must now restrict access for non-essential visitors, change clothing and footwear before entering enclosures, and ensure vehicles are cleaned and disinfected regularly. Areas where birds are kept must be kept unattractive to wild birds, for example by netting ponds and removing food sources. Small backyard owners with only a small number of birds, including chicken, ducks and geese, have been told to limit risks and keep watch for signs of disease. In a joint statement, the chief veterinary officers for England, Scotland and Wales said all bird keepers had to take action. Following a number of detections of avian influenza in wild birds across Great Britain we have declared an avian influenza prevention zone across the whole of Great Britain, the statement said. Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to introduce higher biosecurity standards on your farm or small holding.

The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has put the poultry industry on alert after previous outbreaks led to the culling of tens of millions of birds. It is attracting the attention too of epidemiologists as the virus can be transmitted to humans. China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza so far this year, more than in the whole of 2020. South Korea reported an outbreak at a farm of around 770,000 poultry in Chungcheongbuk-do, the OIE said on Monday, citing a report from the South Korean authorities. All animals were slaughtered. Also in Asia, Japan reported its first outbreak of the 2021 winter season, at a poultry farm in the north-east of the country, the OIE said, confirming a statement last week by Japan's agriculture ministry. The serotype in this outbreak was H5N8. In Europe, Norway reported an H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the Rogaland region in a flock of 7,000 birds, the OIE said.

{"id": "32", "title": "Minister confirms UK has been hit by record bird flu outbreak", "date": "2021-12-09", "fulltext": "George Eustice says restrictions in place since start of November require all birds to be kept indoors The UK has been hit by a record outbreak of avian flu that has led to 500,000 captive birds being culled in recent months. The environment secretary, George Eustice, told the House of Commons: 'This year we are now seeing the largest ever outbreak in the UK of avian influenza, with 36 confirmed cases.' He said an avian influenza prevention zone had been declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. He added: 'Our chief veterinary officer continues to lead the response to this episode.' Earlier the chief vet, Christine Middlemiss, said she was 'very concerned about what's happening.' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme after confirming more outbreaks overnight, she said: 'We now have a total of 40 infected premises in the UK. That's a really high number for the time of year for anything we've experienced before.' By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. Middlemiss said: 'All the birds on the premises have to be culled because of the ongoing risk of infection that they pose. The total number is something like half a million will now have been culled.' She said food supplies would not be hit. 'That sounds a huge number, and for those keepers affected it is really devastating, but it's a relatively very small number in terms of egg supply, meat, chicken and so on.' The disease is spread by migratory wild birds from Europe, where high infections levels are also being recorded. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive for avian flu, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland's Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected avian flu case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on Trotternish, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Middlemiss said almost 300 wild birds had been found with the disease at more than 80 locations. There was 'a lot of virus out there,' she said. The risk to human health is low but infected birds should not be touched. She said: 'It used to be that we would have a reasonable-sized outbreak and then have two or three quiet years. But that's not happening now. We're seeing this across the whole of Europe. We need to understand better why we're getting these ongoing infections every year.' Asked if the disease was still spreading, Middlemiss said: 'We're continuing to get the new detections. I confirmed another two last night and that's the rate we've been going at for the last week or so. We're seeing this as a huge pressure of infection from our wild birds.' Middlemiss urged people with garden bird feeders to 'practice routine hygiene precautions including proper handwashing.' She added: 'If you keep chickens and you want to feed wild birds, you need to make sure that everything is completely scrupulously clean and absolutely separate so that you don't take infection into your own birds and make them sick.' Asked if the climate crisis was to blame for the increased infection, Middlemiss said: 'We don't know specifically, but it's certainly one of the thoughts that our experts are having. The birds migrate to the north of Russia over the summer and mix with other birds on other global flight pathways and exchange the viruses. So it's quite plausible that with climate change and change in pathways that different mixing is going on.'", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "33", "title": "What is bird flu and why is it back in the news?", "date": "2021-12-09", "fulltext": "With the UK hit by a record outbreak, here's a quick guide to the viral disease also known as avian influenza. What is avian flu? Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a contagious viral disease in animals, caused by a virus loosely related to human influenza. Some strains of the disease have been passed to humans but this is very rare, and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals. While all bird species and, less commonly, pigs are thought to be susceptible, domestic poultry flocks are especially vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks can rapidly result in epidemics among bird populations. Public health authorities are concerned about the potential of the virus to mutate into subtypes capable of causing human disease. As a result, they warn there is always a threat of a new influenza pandemic emerging. Why is it in the news again? The UK has been hit by a record outbreak that has resulted in 500,000 captive birds being culled this autumn. An avian influenza prevention zone was declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. What are the most dangerous strains? The NHS says there are four strains that have caused particular concern in recent years. The first, identified in 1997, was H5N1, followed by H7N9 in 2013, H5N6 the following year, and H5N8 in 2016. The H5N1 form has been the cause of most concern in recent years and the UK government has said particular safety measures were put in place in parts of North Yorkshire on 21 November after confirmed and suspected cases of that strain in poultry in the area. Where has it appeared? The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, has said there are 40 infected premises in the UK. They include 38 in Great Britain, of which 33 are in England, and two in Northern Ireland. By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland's Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on the Trotternish peninsula, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Some 22,100 ducks were culled at a commercial premises in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, while culling and an exclusion zone was also being applied to a second site in Broughshane, Co Antrim, described as a 'small backyard flock.' If it just affects birds, why the panic? It doesn't. World Health Organization (WHO) figures show that from 2003 to 2021 there were 863 confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus in humans. Of these cases, 456 people died. While transmission is rare, it has happened. So far, most of the human deaths have been in countries in Asia, in communities in which people live in close proximity to poultry. Although it does not easily infect humans, every time it does it increases the chance that the virus could mutate into a form that could be passed from one infected human to another. The WHO fears this could lead to a flu pandemic. How do you catch bird flu? It is very unlikely you will catch the virus unless you have been in close contact with infected birds or someone with confirmed or suspected bird flu. The virus is found in secretions from the eyes and respiratory tract, and droppings of infected birds. Humans can catch the virus by inhaling droplets sneezed by infected birds or the dust from their bedding or droppings. What are the symptoms in humans? They vary depending on the strain. Most infections have flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and aches and pains. Symptoms of the H5N1 subtype are more severe and frequently result in death. Other symptoms can include conjunctivitis, red, sore and discharging eyes. How does it spread? WHO scientists have said they believe it is likely the virus is carried by migrating birds. More recently the UK government has said it spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. Officials added: 'It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear. Avian influenza isn't an airborne virus.' It can spread to humans who touch infected birds, droppings or bedding or who kill or prepare infected poultry for cooking, the NHS has said. People cannot catch bird flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas affected by an outbreak, health officials have said. What measures is the UK taking? The government has said the chief veterinary officers for each of the UK's constituent nations have agreed to bring in new housing measures to protect poultry and captive birds from avian influenza following a number of confirmed cases across Great Britain in recent weeks. It added: 'The new housing measures, which will come into force on Monday 29 November, mean that it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.' How do you spot the virus in birds? Symptoms in infected birds include a swollen head and blue discoloration around the neck and throat. They will also show signs of breathing problems including gaping beaks, coughing, sneezing and rattling wheezing. Poultry farmers will also notice a loss of appetite in the infected birds and a decrease in egg laying. People are advised not to touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds they find. In Great Britain, dead wild waterfowl or other wild birds should be reported to Defra. Some will then be collected and tested to help scientists understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird. What drug treatments are available to humans? There is no vaccine for avian flu. If a person were infected, the NHS has said they would be either told to stay at home or put into isolation in hospital. They would then be treated with an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (known as Tamiflu) or zanamivir (known as Relenza). Scientists have found that such treatments help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival. They are also sometimes given to people who have been in close contact with infected birds, or those who have had contact with infected people, for example family or healthcare staff, the NHS said.", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that 456 out of 863 confirmed human cases resulted in death.

{"id": "34", "title": "UK reports unprecedented jump in early season bird flu cases", "date": "2021-12-09", "fulltext": "LONDON (AP) — U.K. authorities reported an unprecedented jump in early season cases of avian flu in both domestic and wild birds, triggering tight restrictions on poultry farmers across the country. The government has confirmed 40 outbreaks of avian flu among poultry and other captive birds this year, resulting in the culling of about 500,000 birds, Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said Thursday. There were 24 outbreaks during the entire 2020-21 bird flu season, which ran through the spring. “I’m very concerned about what’s happening,” Middlemiss told the BBC. “That’s a really high number for the time of year for anything we’ve experienced before, and that’s because of the high level of infection in the migratory wild birds. So it’s really, really concerning because those birds will stay with us over the winter until early spring and the risk of infection remains.” U.K. authorities keep a close eye on avian flu cases around the world because it is spread by migrating birds and can be devastating to poultry producers. Experts estimate that outbreaks during the 2014-15 and 2016-17 seasons cost U.K. poultry producers about 125 million pounds ($165 million). While the risk to humans is low, bird flu can affect people in rare cases. To control the spread of the disease, poultry producers must kill all birds at sites where infections are confirmed. In addition, they have been ordered to keep all birds inside or under nets to stop them from coming in contact with wild fowl, and to implement strict hygiene measures. While the number of birds culled so far this season sounds large, it is relatively small compared with the number of birds on U.K. poultry farms. Between the beginning of August and the end of October, poultry producers slaughtered about 20 million birds a week, according to the latest government statistics. “In terms of food supply impact, it’s actually a relatively small number,” Middlemiss said of flu-related culling. The situation in Britain is part of a larger trend across Europe, where authorities are seeing more frequent outbreaks of avian flu, Middlemiss said. Although researchers don’t know the reasons for the trend, one theory is that climate change has altered the migration patterns of wild birds, she said. “The birds migrate to the north of Russia over the summer and mix with other birds and other global flight pathways there and they exchange the viruses, so it’s quite plausible that with climate change and change in pathways different mixing is going on,” Middlemiss said. “But that hasn’t been fully investigated yet.”", "media_outlet": "AP", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

Uri Naveh, a senior scientist at the Israel Parks and Nature Authority, said the situation is not yet under control. \"Many of the birds are dead in the middle of the water body so it's difficult for them to be taken out,\" he said Monday. Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg called the crisis \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country.\" \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" she tweeted. Yaron Michaeli, spokesman for the Hula Lake park, where the crane population is centered, said workers were removing the carcasses as quickly as possible, fearing they could infect other wildlife. Dafna Yurista, spokeswoman for the Agriculture Ministry, said half a million chickens in the area were being slaughtered to prevent the disease from spreading. About 500,000 cranes pass through Israel each year on the way to Africa and a small number stay behind, Michaeli said. This year, an estimated 30,000 cranes stayed in Israel for the winter. Michaeli said it is believed that the cranes were infected by smaller birds that had contact with farms suffering from outbreaks. Israeli media carried photos of workers in white hazmat suits collecting crane carcasses after the birds were first found to be sick about 10 days ago. Michaeli said the death toll among cranes appears to have stabilized in recent days. \"This is a good sign,\" he said. \"They might be starting to get over this. We hope very much.\" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said officials from the agriculture, environment and health ministries were monitoring the situation. There was no immediate information about infections among people, it said. The cleanup is going more slowly than expected. \"We are trying to see if there's any other solutions,\" Naveh said.

As of October, the World Health Organization had confirmed 863 cases of H5N1 in people, 456 of whom died, around the world since 2003. Israel has not recorded any infections in humans this year. Those who have possibly been exposed to the virus are receiving preventive antiviral treatments. Other countries, including Britain, China, Norway and South Korea, have also reported major or higher-than-usual H5N1 outbreaks in recent months. In November, Britain declared a bird flu prevention zone, requiring all farmers to follow stricter biosecurity protocols after several outbreaks. Israel is a central stop along the route of many species of birds migrating from Europe and Asia to Africa, a convergence that raises the risk of avian flu spreading from wild birds to captive poultry populations in the country. Each year, about 500,000 cranes migrate through Israel, some 30,000 of which stayed to winter over there this year. The yearly stopover, often part of journeys lasting thousands of miles, draws the attention of bird enthusiasts, who travel to observe the large, long-legged and long-necked birds. The H5N1 outbreak has wrought \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country,\" Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg said in a tweet Sunday. She shared a photo of dead cranes peppering a lake in Israel's Hula Nature Reserve, a hot spot for migratory birds. \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" Zandberg said. Israel reported its first cases of bird flu in 2006, and has seen outbreaks nearly every year since, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The extent of this year's train of transmission is not yet clear, but regulations require poultry and wild birds be kept separated to limit the chance of transference. Word of Israel's latest outbreak began to spread on Dec. 19, when the Agriculture Ministry reported that H5N1 had been detected in a farming community, Margaliot, near Israel's northern border with Lebanon. The ministry said it had closed off the area and halted egg production. Crowded and unregulated chicken coops are a \"ticking bomb\" for developing diseases, Agriculture Minister Oded Feror said in a statement at the time. That same day, Israeli media reported that about 100 cranes had died in a bird flu outbreak in Hula Lake in a nature reserve in northern Israel. Authorities closed down the area to the public and days later temporarily shut the entire nature reserve. Israel's Nature and Parks Authority shared photos of workers in hazmat suits collecting the bodies of dead cranes from the water. In the following days, outbreaks were detected in at least three other farms in the north as the Agriculture Ministry underwent mass testing. The parks authority said Thursday that an estimated 1 in 5 cranes in Israel were likely to be infected with the virus, Israeli media reported. There have also been reports of deaths from the virus among other bird species. Israel's Agricultural Ministry has warned the public to buy only eggs with the required regulatory stamp and to consume thoroughly cooked eggs to prevent any further spread. The public has also been warned to keep a distance from wild birds. On Tuesday, the ministry told chicken farmers in Margaliot to monitor cats that spend time around the coops, as felines can also become infected with the virus.

JERUSALEM — Israel is acting to contain a severe outbreak of avian flu that has already led to mass culling of infected poultry and has caused the deaths of about 5,000 migratory cranes in a popular nature reserve in the north of the country. The minister of environmental protection, Tamar Zandberg, described the outbreak, identified as the H5N1 type, as 'one of the worst blows to wildlife in Israel's history' after a visit to the Hula Nature Reserve this week. Hula is a wetland that is a central stop on the winter migration route to Africa. The reserve, usually bustling with bird watchers at this time of year, is temporarily closed to visitors and the Ministry of Environmental Protection said on Wednesday that Ms. Zandberg was working to suspend the rest of the hunting season in the country, which normally runs until the end of January. The fear, the ministry said, was that gunshots from bird hunters could cause the wild birds to fly off to other locations, spreading the disease, which it said could also be spread by contaminated car tires on hunters' vehicles or on the soles of their shoes, or by the dogs retrieving their prey. Officials have also warned of the danger of the transmission of avian flu from animals to humans, which could be deadly. No such cases have been recorded in Israel. The first signs of the outbreak came about two months ago, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, with infections cropping up in chicken and turkey farms in different areas of the country. Israel's minister of agriculture and rural development, Oded Forer, said about 600,000 chickens had been culled. He said that would mean a shortfall of 15 million eggs per month over the next few months and that the department was working to import millions of eggs. In an interview with Kan Radio, Israel's public broadcaster, on Tuesday, Mr. Forer blamed the outdated, overcrowded chicken coops that he said were common in Israel for the severity of the outbreak of the virus. The egg industry had been 'neglected for years,' he said, adding that most of the coops in Israel were like those from the 1950s or 60s, and that there was a need to move to more modern coops without cages. More than 100,000 cranes can gather in the Hula Valley during the migration season, which begins in October, according to the reserve, and in recent years many have sojourned there until the spring, when they move back north. The reserve said about 40,000 cranes were documented in the valley early this month. By mid-December the number of dead cranes began to mount up and avian flu was identified as the cause. Most of the dead birds have been found in the water.

The first person in the UK to catch a new strain of bird flu has been named as 79-year-old Alan Gosling, a retired engineer who lived with about 20 ducks inside his home in Devon. Gosling, who had about another 100 ducks living outside on his property in Buckfastleigh, noticed several birds falling ill shortly before Christmas, Devon Live reports. Subsequent tests by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) were returned positive for the H5N1 strain of avian flu. They were subsequently killed shortly after Christmas. Gosling then tested positive for general flu virus and the H5N1 strain of avian flu, first for the strain in the UK. The risk to the wider public continues to be very low, health officials have said, but people have been urged to not touch sick or dead birds. Gosling reportedly welcomed about 20 of the birds into his home as pets after he began feeding the flock. His daughter-in-law, Ellesha Gosling, from Cranbrook, told Devon Live how Gosling begged for their lives to be spared and described the Muscovy ducks as his best friends. She said: \"The past couple of weeks have been hell for this family. He saw all of his ducks killed, and they were like his closest friends.\" The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed on Thursday that a person in the south-west of England had tested positive for bird flu.

The whole of the UK is covered by avian influenza prevention zones, which require bird keepers to take measures to try to stop the disease's spread, such as housing or netting all poultry and captive birds to keep them separate from wild birds, and disinfecting clothing and equipment. Some strains of bird flu can pass from birds to people, but this is extremely rare, according to the UKHSA. It usually requires close contact with an infected bird, so the risk to humans is generally considered very low. Human-to-human transmission of bird flu is also very rare, the organisation said.

(AP) — A duck killed by a hunter in South Carolina had a contagious and dangerous bird flu that has not been detected in the wild in the U.S. in five years, officials said. The flu poses a low risk to people but can spread quickly through chicken houses and other poultry businesses. The Eurasian H5 avian influenza was first detected by Clemson University scientists and confirmed by federal testing, the school said in a news release. The U.S. Department of Agriculture alerted global health officials. Scattered Eurasian H5 infections have been detected in 2022 from Portugal to Bulgaria and in December, two cases were reported in eastern Canada, officials said. Anyone who has poultry, including backyard farms, needs to review their practices to keep birds safe from disease, said State Veterinarian Michael J. Neault, who runs Clemson University's Livestock Poultry Health program. Those practices include thoroughly washing hands before and after handling wild and domesticated birds and using gloves and other protective gear when handling live birds. Farmers should also keep their birds away from areas where geese and ducks roam, clean their cages and coops regularly and buy new birds from reputable sources and keep them away from the rest of the flock for 30 days, the university said. \"So far we have no indication that (the flu) has jumped from wild migratory birds to poultry and we'd very much like to keep it that way,\" Neault said in a statement.", "media_outlet": "AP", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

The RSPB has called for an emergency shooting ban after an 'unprecedented' outbreak of bird flu that has left wildfowl populations in 'catastrophic decline.' Migratory geese that overwinter on the Solway Firth, which stretches between Scotland and Cumbria, are being hardest hit, with a 38% decline in the Svalbard barnacle goose breeding population from winter last year. While these are protected species and not subject to hunting, experts argue that pressure from wildfowlers on nearby, legal quarry species can have an impact. Shoots nearby can cause stress, scaring the birds into the air where they use up vital energy. Some estimates suggest the UK is facing the worst outbreak of avian influenza on record. Latest population counts of the Svalbard breeding population show a drop in numbers from 43,703 in November last year to 27,133 in this month's counts. Paul Walton, the head of habitats and species at RSPB Scotland, said: 'We are in the grip of an unprecedented outbreak and unfortunately the Solway seems to be the epicentre of this in the UK. Our birds are suffering and they need an urgent reprieve to help them get through this winter and ensure that as many as possible of those remaining survive to make their migration back home to Scandinavia to breed in the summer. The best way we can do this is by reducing the cumulative impacts of disturbance, including by wildfowling. Our teams on the ground are seeing many birds that are sick or dying and under significant stress. Anything that can be done to limit activities which incur additional disturbance at this time should be implemented with urgency. This action could help these populations during this period of catastrophic decline caused by the outbreak.' There are allowances under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 for a temporary pause in the hunting of wildfowl if there are prolonged periods of freezing weather. The RSPB is asking for this consideration in the event of a severe avian influenza outbreak. It has also asked the public to keep dogs under close control in the Solway coastal area to avoid further disturbing the birds. After the barnacle goose gained protection in the 1950s, following a long campaign by conservationists, the world population rose from just a few hundred individuals to about 40,000. But the recent sharp decline has made experts concerned the good work could be undone. Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry bird flu. Many bird populations, from chickens to swans, have been hit by the flu, which is deadly. An avian influenza prevention zone came into force across Great Britain on 3 November, meaning birdkeepers must keep their flock separate from wild birds and put strict biosecurity measures in place.

The United States Department of Agriculture said its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza at the farm in Dubois County. State officials have quarantined the farm and its 29,000 turkeys are being euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease, said Denise Derrer Spears, a spokeswoman for the Indiana State Board of Animal Health.

This does not present an immediate concern to public health, federal officials said, but it does have agriculture and industry folks worried. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the confirmed case of the H5N1 strain of avian flu at a farm in Dubois County. It is a highly pathogenic strain, meaning it is lethal to all poultry that contract the disease. This is the nation's first confirmed case of the flu in a commercial operation since 2020 and six years since it was last found on farms in Indiana, when hundreds of thousands of birds were killed as a result.

'This is a foreign animal disease and shouldn't be on our landscape,' said Denise Derrer Spears, the spokeswoman of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. 'That flips the switch and makes this a big deal right off the bat, and we need to stamp it out before it gets out of control.' The response to the outbreak has been swift, both from state and federal agencies as well as the economy. Taiwan has restricted poultry meat and egg products from Indiana while China and Korea blocked non-heated poultry meat from the state, the USDA said on its website. Though limited, these trade restrictions and loss of poultry are a blow to the farm sector and individual producers. You cannot get bird flu from eating fully cooked poultry meat or eggs, according to medical experts. This does not present a food safety risk, and the USDA said turkeys from the affected farm will not enter the food supply. 'But it's a matter of public perception,' Derrer Spears said. The current situation began on Feb. 7, when the affected farmer noticed about 100 birds were dead in one of his barns and the remaining ones were lethargic. He worked with his veterinarian to get samples collected from the flock and sent to a lab at Purdue University. The results were then confirmed at a USDA lab in Iowa. The name of the affected farm has not been publicly identified. As soon as the state received the results, it issued a quarantine at the site and all those farms within a 10-kilometer radius. That includes 17 other operations, Derrer Spears said. She could not give exact numbers on how many birds were impacted, but it's likely more than a few hundred thousand. Dubois County is the top turkey-producing county in Indiana. And Indiana is the third-largest turkey-producing state in the country, the No. 1 state in duck production and the second largest in table eggs and egg-laying chickens. All those farms within the control area will have to test their animals at least once each week to monitor for the disease. The first round of tests came back negative, Derrer Spears said, but the state is remaining very cautious. 'While it's just one incident right now, 18 farms in total are affected by this,' she added. 'There is no cure for this disease, there is no way to save the birds, all birds will die from this so we want to put them down as quickly as possible.' The control area will remain in effect until the affected farm is fully cleaned, the euthanized turkeys are disposed of and no further cases are detected. All turkeys at the infected farm, 29,000 birds, were put down by Wednesday night, according to the state. That depopulation needs to happen as quickly as possible so that the birds do not languish and so the virus does not have more time to spread. The euthanized turkeys will then be disposed of onsite by composting them, a method that is approved and overseen by state and federal agencies. The barns and all equipment will also need to be thoroughly cleaned 'flat off the floor clean,' Derrer Spears said. Once the cleaning is complete and the disposal has reached a certain stage, the quarantine will be lifted. There are many factors involved and there is no target date to do that, the state said it likely will be about four to six weeks. It is unclear how the Dubois County flock was infected. The avian flu viruses are fairly common in wild migratory birds and waterfowl, according to Derrer Spears, and ducks and geese that contract the disease will spread it in their droppings as they fly by. The strain has been wreaking havoc on Asia and Europe and also has been found in some wild birds along the East Coast. Canada recently confirmed H5N1 bird flu in a commercial poultry operation in Nova Scotia. This outbreak is significant because it shows that the strain has entered a migratory pathway for birds called the Mississippi Flyway, which follows the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and includes several major poultry states such as Indiana. The last time this bird flu was found in commercial poultry in Indiana was in January 2016. 'Last time we had this, it was terrible,' Derrer Spears said. That situation similarly started with one flock and then testing showed that it had spread to nearly a dozen other flocks. Ultimately, more than 400,000 birds needed to be euthanized. The year prior, in 2015, the same strain wreaked havoc on the Midwest turkey industry and caused the largest animal disease outbreak ever in the U.S. While Indiana remained largely unscathed from that national outbreak, it led to the destruction of more than 50 million birds and cost the U.S. economy more than $3 billion.", "media_outlet": "USA Today", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

Plagued by underinvestment and disruptions, the 23-nation OPEC Plus alliance has been unable to fully restore the output it halted—a problem the IEA expects to worsen. With oil inventories at the lowest in seven years, the agency sees markets facing further strain. \"The oil market is incredibly tight,\" \"Prices continue to surge and are now reaching levels that are uncomfortable for consumers across the world,\" Toril Bosoni, head of the agency's markets and industry division, said in a Bloomberg television interview on Friday. By the end of the year, the shortfall between the amount of oil OPEC Plus was supposed to have pumped and what it actually delivered since the start of 2021 could amount to 1 billion barrels, the IEA estimates. Rising prices have been an acute source of pain for major economies, fanning a surge in inflation. Bloomberg News Under Armour beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Friday, as the sportswear maker benefited from strong demand for its athletic wear and higher prices of its hoodies and leggings to counter inflation. Athletic wear has become a major part of everyday fashion since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, helping Under Armour and its rivals Lululemon, Athletica and Nike book outsize gains in sales. Under Armour's net revenue in North America increased 15 percent in the fourth quarter. Luxury watches from the German village of Glashuette are gaining protected status similar to bubbly wine coming from the Champagne region in France. The country's upper house of parliament on Friday signed off on the so-called Glashuette Decree, ensuring that only timepieces made in the town of about 7,000 people in the eastern state of Saxony are permitted to display the vaunted name. The town boasts the greatest concentration of world-class watchmakers outside Switzerland.

{"id": "48", "title": "Chicken Industry Tightens Defenses as Bird Flu Hits Flocks; U.S. poultry industry steps up biosecurity defenses as cases identified in commercial and wild flocks", "date": "2022-02-14", "fulltext": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday it had identified instances of deadly bird flu in U.S. flocks, putting the poultry industry on high alert for more widespread outbreaks. The USDA reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a flock of about 240,000 birds at a commercial chicken farm in Fulton County, Ky. Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. chicken processor by sales, confirmed that the farm housed the company's chickens. A separate outbreak was confirmed in a backyard flock of birds in Fauquier County, Va., the USDA said. State officials quarantined the affected areas, and the birds on the farms will be destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease. Federal and state authorities are surveilling and testing areas around the affected flocks, the USDA said. None of the affected birds will enter the food supply, according to the USDA. Recent avian-influenza outbreaks haven't posed a health risk to humans, federal officials have said. A severe outbreak in the U.S. could pose a threat to poultry companies such as Tyson, Perdue Farms Inc., Sanderson Farms Inc. and Pilgrim's Pride Corp. Meat companies are already raising prices as they cite worker shortages that have left them unable to meet customer demand, as well as higher transportation and feed costs. Tyson is working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus, a spokesman said, and the company doesn't expect the affected farm in Kentucky to affect its overall chicken production levels. Tyson Foods said last week on its quarterly earnings call with analysts that the Arkansas-based company has increased biosecurity protections in its East Coast facilities, taking extra time to clean vehicles that go to farms and reducing the number of trips to farms overall. 'We have very robust biosecurity measures in place across all of our facilities, and that includes testing every flock for avian influenza,' David Bray, group president of poultry for Tyson, said on the call. Multiple bird-flu cases have been reported across North America in recent weeks, prompting poultry companies to take action. Avian influenza has been confirmed in commercial and backyard flocks in three states this year, the USDA said. An outbreak was reported last week in Dubois County, Ind., on a commercial turkey farm. Earlier this month, bird flu was detected in two wild birds in Florida. In January, a separate case was found in a wild bird in Colleton County in South Carolina, according to the USDA. Canada also recently confirmed a bird-flu case in a commercial turkey farm in western Nova Scotia. The U.S. poultry industry has remained largely unaffected by the disease since an outbreak in 2015 led to the deaths of more than 50 million chickens and turkeys. Since then, chicken, turkey and egg processors invested in new biosecurity measures and other precautions to stem the disease's spread Perdue Farms said none of the recent outbreaks have affected its flocks, but the positive cases are concerning, a company spokeswoman said. The Maryland-based company is having all of its flock advisers visit the farmers in their service area to review biosecurity protocols, she said. Shares of Tyson closed down about 3% Monday. Shares of Sanderson Farms and egg giant Cal-Maine Foods Inc. both declined about 1%, while Pilgrim's Pride declined 0.5%. Major stock indexes declined by less than 1%. Any immediate impact on poultry companies' sales is likely to be minimal, because chicken-importing countries may decide to continue purchasing U.S. poultry products from states where bird flu hasn't been detected, said Christine McCracken, executive director of meat research at agricultural lender Rabobank. A bigger impact on exports could come if the virus is reported in major poultry producing states like Arkansas, she said. 'It is being carried by wild birds so there isn't much control over the spread other than traditional biosecurity measures,' Ms. McCracken said. 'It's still early in the season, but it wouldn't be surprising if additional cases are found.' Labor shortages on farms also may increase the risk of spreading the virus, she said. Chicken producers are relying on a smaller number of available workers to clean more farms, and newer workers may not be as efficient at certain hygiene practices, she said.
