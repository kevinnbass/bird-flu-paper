Nearly 2 billion animals a year are now trucked and shipped around the world on journeys that can take weeks. We'll be exploring why this trade continues, the risk it poses to disease spread and why the EU has become such a key player. We started the series reporting on hundreds of thousands of unwanted male dairy calves due to be born in Ireland this year, where the choice may be between live export or disposing on-farm. We've also reported on the huge revenues generated by the industry, with the Middle East a key market. In 1988, the global trade in all live animals was worth $716m (£48m); by 2017 that had risen to $21bn. In 2016, Saudi Arabia alone imported almost $1bn worth of live animals, mostly sheep. If you have some expertise in this field and would like to contribute to our investigation, please get in touch via animalsfarmed@theguardian.com. News from around the world More than 800 million animals are estimated to have been killed in Australian bushfires, which have burned 10 million hectares (40,000 square miles) of land in the country. The Australian government expects that 100,000 cattle and sheep could be lost as a result of the bushfires. At least 13,120 farm animals have been euthanised or confirmed dead as a result of bushfires in New South Wales. An outbreak of the highly contagious H5N8 bird flu has been rapidly spreading across eastern Europe this month. Outbreaks have been reported in the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. French authorities culled millions of birds in an attempt to contain the last outbreak of the H5N8 virus in Europe in 2017. In China, an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N6 bird flu has been reported in swans in the western Xinjiang region of the country. A reported 180 sheep rescued from the Queen Hind cargo ship that capsized as they were being transported from Romania to Saudi Arabia are due to be resettled. More than 14,000 sheep onboard the ship died. Animal welfare groups leading the rescue of the sheep opposed sending the surviving animals on to Saudi Arabia for slaughter and are in discussions to gain custody of the sheep and resettle them in animal sanctuaries in Romania. One of Europe's largest meat producers, the Netherlands-based Vion, has said it expects the numbers of pigs and cattle in western Europe to decline by 20% over the next decade. It also expects meat consumption to fall by 1½% a year over the same period. Dutch food safety inspectors still allegedly encounter pigs drowning in hot water having not been properly killed, according to documents obtained by an animal rights group. Campaigners have called for independent camera surveillance on slaughter lines in the Netherlands. In England, all abattoirs are required to have CCTV installed. A farming minister in the German state of Lower Saxony has called for a meat tax to be introduced in the country. Meat in Germany is currently taxed at a reduced rate of 7% instead of 19%. Former environment minister Michael Gove has previously rejected the idea of introducing a meat tax in the UK.

{"id": "4", "title": "Opinion: Bird flu. SARS. China coronavirus. Is history repeating itself?", "date": "2020-01-27", "fulltext": "HONG KONG Sometimes history seems to unspool in a continuous playback loop. That is the feeling I get from watching Hongkongers donning face masks, dousing hands with sanitizer, and once again bracing for the possibility that a deadly new coronavirus outbreak originating in mainland China will spread here. Chinese authorities' delayed response, the secrecy breeding mistrust, the lack of full transparency, and efforts to control the narrative by downplaying the seriousness it all rings sadly familiar. Public health emergencies should be handled quickly, transparently, and devoid of political considerations. But public health is inherently political and, with anything involving China, politics can never be fully excised. For Chinese Communist officials, particularly at the provincial level, there is an innate tendency to cover up and conceal, their long-imbued penchant for secrecy always taking precedence over trifling concerns like promoting public awareness and advocating proper precautions. That was certainly the case in late 1997, just after China assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong, when the territory was hit by an outbreak of the H5N1 virus known as 'bird flu.' Well into the outbreak, with people sick and some dying, Hong Kong officials were reluctant to finger China as the source, even though 80% of the territory's poultry came from the mainland. Hong Kong ordered the slaughter of more than 1.3 million chickens, ducks, pigeons, and other birds, but officials were still nonsensically hesitant to point to China as the culprit behind the contagion out of fear of contradicting Beijing, which insisted strongly that all its chickens were healthy. Support STAT: STAT is offering coverage of the coronavirus for free. Please consider a subscription to support our journalism. Start free trial today. The same obfuscation and denial came from China's Communist authorities in reaction to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, also caused by a coronavirus, in late 2002 and 2003. Even as the virus spread, Chinese officials continued to undercount cases and delay reporting information to the World Health Organization. The government did not warn the public for months, allowing people carrying the virus to migrate freely, and did not alert the WHO until February 2003. China finally began concerted action in the summer of 2003 and SARS was quickly brought under control. But the inadequate reporting and delayed response led to a public health trust deficit that persists today. Like bird flu in 1997 and the SARS epidemic of 2002 to 2003, the newest coronavirus has originated in the mainland, this time in Wuhan, most likely in a market where exotic wild animals are sold. Like before, there are suspicions that in these early stages the number of confirmed cases were undercounted, underreported, or both. Like before, there were delays and denials, with Wuhan officials initially downplaying the virus as mild, treatable, and contained while dismissing the likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Those who disagreed online were questioned by police for spreading 'false rumors.' But 2020 is not 1997, nor even 2003. China's public health infrastructure and reporting system have become more reliable. Most importantly, internet use and penetration in China today makes it virtually impossible for a cover-up to last for long. Despite censorship of some news about the coronavirus including blocking foreign media websites social media platforms have been filled with debate, discussion, and questions from citizens asking what precautions they should take. State media has also made much of President Xi Jinping's instruction to local officials to open up about the number of cases and the severity of the epidemic or risk consequences. And WHO investigators and Hong Kong specialists have been allowed to visit Wuhan. Does this signal that Beijing is opting for a new policy of transparency this time? 'It's still very mixed,' said my colleague, King-wa Fu, who studies Chinese censorship patterns at the University of Hong Kong. 'We see censorship. But we also see a lot of discussion online. We'll have to wait and see.' The rapid spiral in the number of identified cases of infection with the coronavirus, and the new draconian measures taken, like effectively quarantining Wuhan at the start of the busy Lunar New Year travel period, breeds suspicion that the real picture may be far worse than officials even now admit. Even the quarantine smacks of too little, too late. It seems ill-planned, and likely to be largely ineffective. First there is the near impracticality of sealing off a city of 11 million people, larger than the populations of Hong Kong or New York City. The move was taken the day before the New Year's Eve travel period, when many people would have already started on their journeys. Planes, trains, and buses were halted, but it was unclear what provisions would be made for private cars. Perhaps most inexplicably, the ban was announced to take effect at 10 a.m. on a Thursday, creating an early-morning crush of travelers trying to get out ahead of the quarantine. Then there's the matter of whether such a closure of Wuhan could even be effective. Some public health experts I spoke with said there seems to have been no provision made for getting food, fuel, and critical supplies like medicine into the city, or how investigators, decision-makers, or even journalists would enter and whether they would then be permitted to leave. And while the closure might temporarily tamp down the geographical spread of the coronavirus apart from those residents who have already left it could also have the unintended effect of turning Wuhan into an incubator of infection. The Hong Kong government was already facing a loss of public confidence after months of protests sparked by Chief Executive Carrie Lam's botched extradition bill. Some pro-democracy lawmakers and ordinary citizens are accusing the government of dragging its feet on the virus crisis for fear of offending Beijing for example, not shutting down the West Kowloon rail terminus, and not immediately demanding arriving mainland train passengers fill out health declaration forms. Bird flu redux. For the Chinese Communist Party, which just celebrated 70 years in power, its legitimacy derives not from any election but from its performance. China's leaders base their right to rule on how effectively they have managed what is soon to be the world's largest economy. One may have thought China's leaders had learned from their errors handling SARS. Unfortunately, history teaches us otherwise, and seems to be repeating itself again. Keith B.

{"id": "5", "title": "Avian Influenza in China Adds to Economic Concerns Amid Coronavirus Spread; China pledges more support for its economy, exempts from punitive tariffs products", "date": "2020-02-01", "fulltext": "HONG KONG—Chinese authorities announced Saturday a recurrence of avian influenza in chickens in central China, adding fresh economic concerns for a country reeling from an outbreak of coronavirus that has sickened nearly 12,000 people since it emerged in December. In a sign of the pressure already on China, Australia and Vietnam joined the U.S. and others in distancing their citizens from the country over the coronavirus, while Apple Inc. shut its stores on the Chinese mainland and Beijing pledged more support for embattled businesses. The Latest on the Coronavirus * Australia orders its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days * Vietnam halts all flights to and from Taiwan and China * Apple closes all of its retail stores in mainland China until Feb. 9 * Beijing pledges more support for its economy * Avian influenza adds to concerns about economy The avian influenza is likely to add to the economic damage rather than pose a major immediate health risk. China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that a case of H5N1 avian influenza, last identified in China in April last year, had killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. But while avian influenza can be fatal in humans, with a mortality rate of 60%, according to the World Health Organization, it doesn't spread easily to humans. In addition to the coronavirus, China has been grappling with an outbreak of African swine fever that has decimated the country's pig population over the past two years. Pork is China's main source of protein, and swine fever last year pushed overall consumer inflation to the highest level in eight years. Hunan province, where the avian influenza outbreak announced on Saturday took place, neighbors Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Australia said that it would impose new entry restrictions in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, banning foreign nationals who have been in mainland China in the past 14 days from entering Australia, while Qantas Airways Ltd., the country's national carrier, said it would suspend flights to the mainland starting Feb. 9. Vietnam's civil aviation authority said it would halt all flights to and from Taiwan and China, including the special Chinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong, starting Saturday. Several countries and airlines have suspended flights to China, including Pakistan, Italy and the U.S.'s American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. The move by Australia, which also ordered its citizens returning from China to self-quarantine for 14 days, to tighten entry restrictions followed a U.S. tightening. A day earlier, the U.S. said it would deny entry to foreign nationals who had traveled anywhere in China within the past 14 days and imposed quarantines on Americans returning from Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. The coronavirus has killed 259 people and infected nearly 12,000 in China as of late Friday, according to the official National Health Commission in Beijing. The number of infected patients in China alone now exceeds the global total for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed nearly 800 people after emerging from southern China in 2002 and 2003. Authorities in Beijing pledged more support for the economy in a bid to reassure investors before markets reopen on Monday. Companies and industries in regions hit particularly hard by the outbreak, including those that provide medical supplies, could get reduced lending rates, the central bank said in a joint statement with other government agencies, including the Finance Ministry and the banking regulator. China's cabinet said separately that products imported from the U.S. to control the outbreak will be exempt from punitive tariffs through March 31. Authorities also exempted tariffs and other taxes on products donated by overseas entities, according to a joint statement by the Finance Ministry and the customs agency. Resources are strained in Hubei province, and medical staff have been forced to turn away patients because of a lack of beds and basic medical supplies. Local authorities in Huanggang, a city about 35 miles east of Wuhan, imposed new restrictions on residents' movements, saying only one person per household in the city center would be allowed to go out every two days to purchase basic necessities. Apple is closing all of its retail stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb. 9 'out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts,' it said. The company operates more than 40 stores in China. North Korea said through its state media that it would send an aid fund to Chinese authorities, a rare extension of aid from Pyongyang. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, 'expressed deep consolation for the families who lost their blood relatives due to the infectious disease,' according to a report in Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency. North Korea—a close ally of China that has long been dependent on China's largess—was among the first countries to adopt stringent measures to keep the coronavirus outside its borders, and vowed to redouble its efforts. 'The novel coronavirus throws the world into uneasiness and horror, but the advantages and might of our state system—will be fully demonstrated to the whole world once again, when we ensure that the virus does not reach our country and that no one suffers from the infections,' it read.

{"id": "6", "title": "Industry scrambles to stop fatal bird flu in South Carolina", "date": "2020-04-10", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — An infectious and fatal strain of bird flu has been confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in South Carolina, the first case of the more serious strain of the disease in the United States since 2017 and a worrisome development for an industry that was devastated by previous outbreaks. The high pathogenic case was found at an operation in Chesterfield County, South Carolina, marking the first case of the more dangerous strain since one found in a Tennessee chicken flock in 2017. In 2015, an estimated 50 million poultry had to be killed at operations mainly in the Upper Midwest after infections spread throughout the region. “Yes, it’s concerning when we see cases, but we are prepared to respond very quickly and that was done in this case,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The USDA has been working in recent months with scientists and farmers in North Carolina and South Carolina, where a low pathogenic — or less severe — strain of bird flu had been detected. Low pathogenic bird flu causes few clinical signs in infected birds. However, two strains of low pathogenic bird flu — the H5 and H7 strains — can mutate into highly pathogenic forms, which are frequently fatal to birds and easily transmissible between susceptible species. Low pathogenic cases were already in an area near the South Carolina and North Carolina state line and USDA was closely monitoring and testing. The case in Chesterfield County, South Carolina was expected to be another low pathogenic case, but it came back from the laboratory high pathogenic which means the less severe virus mutated into the more severe version, Cole said. “Our scientists at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory had looked at the virus characteristics of the low path virus and they had previously indicated that this was one that was probably likely to mutate so they were watching it very closely,” Cole said. A laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the virus that had been killing turkeys was a high pathogenic H7N3 strain of avian influenza. A report on the outbreak indicates it was discovered on April 6. It has killed 1,583 turkeys and the remainder of the 32,577 birds in the flock were euthanized. State officials quarantined the farm, movement controls were implemented and enhanced surveillance was already in place in the area. “The flock was quickly depopulated and will not enter the marketplace,” said Joel Brandenberger, president of the National Turkey Federation, an industry trade group. “Thorough disinfecting and cleaning procedures have already been initiated on premises as well as surveillance of commercial flocks in the surrounding area. This occurrence poses no threat to public health. Turkey products remain safe and nutritious.” He said poultry farmers implement strict biosecurity measures year-round and routinely test flocks for avian influenza. These measures were implemented after an H5N2 avian influenza outbreak that began in December 2014 swept commercial chicken, egg laying and turkey populations throughout much of 2015 killing 50 million birds and causing as much as $3 billion in economic damage. That outbreak is believed to have originated in wild birds. Nearly 90 percent of the bird losses were on egg-laying chicken farms in Iowa and turkey farms in Minnesota. The bulk of other cases occurred in the adjacent states of Nebraska, Wisconsin, and South Dakota. Cole said since 2015 significant planning, exercises and coordination has occurred between the federal government, state agencies and the industry. Cole said the coronavirus pandemic has not affected the ability of the government to respond to the bird flu. A highly pathogenic H7N9 bird flu strain was detected in Lincoln County, Tennessee, in a chicken flock of 73,500 birds in early March 2017.

{"id": "7", "title": "Avian Flu Fast Facts", "date": "2024-06-05", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Here's a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds. There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called 'Influenza A (H5N1),' or the 'H5N1 virus.' Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu. The mortality rate is close to 60% for infected humans. Timeline Early 1900s -The avian flu is first identified in Italy. 1961 - The H5N1 strain is isolated in birds in South Africa. December 1983 - Chickens in Pennsylvania and Virginia are exposed to the avian flu and more than five million birds are killed to stop the disease from spreading. 1997 - Eighteen people are infected by the H5N1 strain in Hong Kong, six die.

{"id": "8", "title": "You got it': how bird flu turned one US farmer's life upside down", "date": "2020-09-17", "fulltext": "Greg Langmo's decades-old business was among those hit when a lethal strain decimated poultry barns across America. In April 2015, Greg Langmo's five turkey farms teemed with toms, hens and chicks. His family's decades-old business in Meeker county, Minnesota, was thriving, and the hundreds of thousands of birds he bred and sold each year were healthy. And then, late one evening, Langmo's phone rang. Birds in one of his barns, usually active, were sitting, unable to make the short walk to their feeders and waterers. The following morning, he found hundreds of limp, white-feathered bodies. Langmo sent some dead toms to the University of Minnesota's veterinary diagnostic laboratory. That night, the farmer lay sleepless. Again, his phone rang. It was a vet from the lab: 'You got it.' Langmo's farms had been hit by the Eurasian/North American H5N2 strain of lethal avian influenza, which, along with another lethal strain, Eurasian H5N8, rampaged across poultry farms in the American west and midwest between December 2014 and June 2015. A third strain, Eurasian/North American H5N1, was detected in nearly 100 wild birds by US wildlife biologists. It was the first time a foreign strain of bird flu H5N8 had entered North America and mixed with mild bird flu viruses. It's one of many lethal bird flu outbreaks to kill billions of birds and cost billions of dollars over the past hundred years. Such losses are part of the reality of farming today. Lethal avian influenza's advent is strongly linked to the development of modern agriculture, which created a global network of disease incubators—industrial farms in some parts of the world, live animal markets in others—linked by trading routes, movement of labourers and equipment, and migration of wild birds. Critical diagnosis Soon after the diagnosis, says Langmo, 'the rest of the birds began dying by the bushel.' To stop the spread, Langmo and his employees killed survivors with a swift crack to the back of the head. Within three days, virtually all 11,000 toms in the infected barn were dead. Then they moved into the other barns. Workers from the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) arrived and doused any live birds with water-based foam, an asphyxiant used to mass-euthanise poultry in emergencies only. Foam flowed across the floors, bubbling like a choppy sea, the turkeys beneath it gasping for air. Fifteen minutes later, all were dead. Only other poultry farmers will know the helpless feeling of losing a great flock of birds, Greg Langmo reflected. He lost 225,000 turkeys across five farms. Langmo was one of 211 American commercial poultry farmers who battled bird flu during the 2014-15 outbreak, the worst the $40bn (£1bn) US poultry industry has experienced. Twenty-one flocks on backyard farms were diagnosed and destroyed. Nationwide, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys died from the virus or were killed to control it. American commercial poultry farmers lost about $1.6bn. The US poultry industry lost an estimated $3.3bn. 'This outbreak was arguably the most significant animal health event in US history,' says Dr Julie Gauthier, assistant director for poultry health at USDA-APHIS. Deadly history Lethal bird flu, originally 'fowl plague,' was first diagnosed on Italian farms in 1878. While poultry die-offs reported before 1878 may have been bird flu, this was the first time scientists distinguished the virus from bacterial poultry diseases, such as fowl cholera. Subsequent research revealed that bird flu is an influenza-A virus. These viruses are rarely lethal and often mildly afflict their natural hosts. But lethal influenza-A viruses, which mutate in and emerge from the bodies of domesticated animals, are known to infect and kill not just poultry, but birds, horses, swine, bats, dogs and even humans. The emergence and coexistence of three hybrid lethal bird flu strains—H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8—in the US during the 2014-2015 pandemic underscores the ability of influenza-A viruses to rapidly mix, transform, infect and persist. Lethal bird flu viruses have emerged more frequently as poultry farms have expanded capacities and quickened animal-rearing rates over the past 50 years. In the 37 years from 1959 to 1995, these viruses emerged 14 times globally, about one outbreak every 2.6 years; while in the 13 years from 1996 to 2008, they arose 11 times, about one outbreak every 1.2 years. These species don't mix Scientists and farmers are divided over the best way forward. In terms of prevention, should birds be kept inside, which would reduce potential contact with wild birds? Should large-scale movement of animals (industrial farming depends on the transportation of large populations of birds after breeding and for slaughter) be scaled down? That is one of the key vectors by which the disease may be spread. Some regions of the world look to good farm hygiene and high levels of biosecurity, where infected birds are confined and killed to eradicate disease; others, particularly in countries with many outdoor industrial farms, struggle with implementing biosecurity and may lack available veterinary care, so they allow diseases to circulate, using vaccines to reduce illness and mortality. 'Vaccines do not prevent birds from becoming infected with the avian influenza virus or from producing and shedding the virus into the environment,' says Gauthier, adding that up until now culling birds was the preferred solution in the US. Constant threat Gene Baur, president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary, a UK-based animal protection organisation, believes that establishing a network of small farms serving local communities is one powerful possibility, because it reduces the need for transporting animals, farm labourers and equipment. Scientists are recognising the benefits of giving birds more space—research shows chickens stressed by overcrowded living conditions typical to commercial farms have diminished immunity to disease. After a major avian influenza outbreak in Thailand from 2004 to 2005, experts determined that industrial farms were more likely to be infected than backyard farms. In the Netherlands, after a 2003 outbreak, scientists suggested that thinning commercial flocks could prevent the next epidemic. When you confine animals in these filthy conditions they become breeding grounds for disease, Gene Baur, Farm Sanctuary, says. 'When you confine animals in these filthy, crowded, stressful conditions, just like humans, they become breeding grounds for disease,' says Baur. After considering his financial losses from the 2014-2015 pandemic, Langmo spent a year rebuilding his business, downsizing from five farms to two. He says he's boosted biosecurity by cutting cross-traffic, checking birds' health more frequently and improving sanitation with routine deep-cleanings. 'After a thorough sanitisation, each barn literally needs to be as clean as your kitchen, no feathers, no nothing,' says Langmo. 'It's very expensive.'

It follows outbreaks of a highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of bird flu in Cheshire, Devon, Gloucestershire and Hertfordshire over the past two weeks. The outbreaks have been found in wild bird populations and two broiler chicken farms, where all the birds are being culled. Farmers are required to restrict access for non-essential people, remove sources of wild bird food and ensure workers are regularly disinfecting footwear and changing clothes. Those found to not be complying face up to three months in prison or unlimited fines, according to the measures announced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). UK and European farmers have been on alert after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. When bird flu was detected in the same area of Russia in the summers of 2005 and 2016, epidemics followed in northern and eastern Europe. However, the speed of the spread of outbreaks in Europe over the past few weeks has caught the industry by surprise, with hundreds of thousands of birds culled after multiple outbreaks across Germany and the Netherlands. Thousands of dead wild birds were also reportedly found on the north-west coast of Germany last week, most likely infected with bird flu. British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said bird flu was a significant threat to the commercial poultry industry and he supported new restrictive measures to minimise the risk of a larger and wider outbreak. It is an incredibly difficult situation for farmers and producers if they get a case of avian influenza (AI), so the controls and their costs are made to be as fair as they can be. For instance, farmers are compensated for the culling of healthy birds as part of AI controls. The system is as fair as it possibly can be, given the nature of the situation. During the last significant bird flu outbreak in 2016/17, there was also a ban on keeping poultry outdoors. Defra said this was not being considered at present, but would be if the outbreak spread further. Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and that properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. PHE said: Our advice regarding contact with wild birds remains the same make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after coming into contact with any animal and do not touch any sick or dead birds.

{"id": "12", "title": "Bird flu fears grow after spate of mysterious UK swan deaths", "date": "2020-11-27", "fulltext": "Virus causing high levels of mortality in birds, with risk to chickens and other poultry A spate of baffling swan deaths is strongly suspected to be caused by a virulent new strain of avian flu sweeping across Britain. Dying swans were found spinning in circles and discharging blood from their nostrils on Ulverston canal, Cumbria. Swan rescuers have taken in more than 25 dying birds in Worcestershire and nine swans were found dead in Stanley Park, Blackpool. Postmortem examinations have confirmed that six black swans and cygnets that died in Dawlish, Devon, had contracted the latest strain of bird flu, H5N8. Brought in by wild birds migrating across Europe, the strain last caused widespread avian deaths in the winter of 2016-17. The risk to human health from the virus is very low, according to Public Health England. Fears are growing that the virus will wipe out chickens and other poultry this winter, with outbreaks already confirmed among captive birds in Kent, Cheshire, Leicestershire, and chickens at a broiler breeding farm in Herefordshire. The government has declared an avian influenza prevention zone across England, Scotland and Wales, requiring all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures. While the virus is particularly visible in swans and large wildfowl, other wild bird deaths confirmed this month include pink-footed geese, greylag geese, Canada geese, buzzards and curlews. Dr Ruth Cromie, a research fellow at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, said: 'Wild birds are often seen as evil vectors, but they are victims of a virus which originally spread from poultry. Wild birds get used as scapegoats for poor biosecurity and people moving chickens around the globe.' She said avian flu, like all influenza viruses, regularly mutates, and there are either genetic or environmental factors making it particularly pathogenic this year. The virus disrupts the nervous system and can cause neurological symptoms in birds, such as head-twitching, stumbling and swimming in circles. Cromie added: 'We can be sure it is causing high levels of mortality this year.' Caroline Sim, of Flying Free, a volunteer operation to protect and rescue swans in Ulverston, said she had never seen such strange symptoms in the family of 10 swans there that died of bird flu. 'Many of them started to spin on their axis in one direction. It was terrible to see. Some of them were discharging from their nostrils and some of it was bloody,' she said. The dead birds were collected by officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to be tested. David Cash, of Worcester Swan Rescue, said about 25 swans had died. 'The swans were looking lethargic and not wanting food, and doing a lot of coughing – similar to the symptoms of Covid.' The government's prevention zone obliges all bird keepers to take measures to discourage mixing between captive and wild birds, such as feeding and watering their birds in enclosed areas, and removing wild bird food sources from around captive birds. Experts noticed an unusually high level of avian flu in Russia during the summer, and this has been spread across Europe by wild species, such as swans and geese, during their westward migration for the winter. Christine Middlemiss, the UK chief veterinary officer, repeated the Food Standards Agency advice that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for consumers. She added: 'Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to meet enhanced biosecurity requirements and this is in your interests to do, to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.' Cromie said that while improving biosecurity was the best short-term solution, the authorities should be looking at how these viruses originate in and are amplified by industrial meat production. Britain slaughters more than 1 billion chickens every year. She said: 'We should not be looking to put every chicken in a house, but asking: do we really need to have that many chickens?

{"id": "13", "title": "All hens and other farm birds to be kept inside in GB avian flu crackdown", "date": "2020-12-04", "fulltext": "Eggs can continue to be labelled free-range for 16 weeks and poultry meat for 12 weeks, says Defra. Millions of free-range hens and other birds will have to be kept indoors from 14 December, in a national government crackdown to try to limit the spread of a virulent strain of avian flu across Great Britain. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a statement that the chief vets of England, Scotland and Wales had agreed the new legal requirement for all birdkeepers to bring their flocks indoors, to keep them separate from potentially infectious wild birds. The strict new lockdown-style measures, which have already been introduced in the Netherlands, apply not only to large commercial poultry farms but also smaller keepers with hens in coops or garden pens. Keepers are being urged to use the next 11 days to prepare for the new measures, including taking steps to safeguard animal welfare, consult their vet and where necessary erect additional housing or self-contained netted areas. Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as free-range for 16 weeks after the birds have been brought indoors, but if the restrictions last beyond that they must be downgraded to barn produced using stickers on packaging. Similarly, poultry meat can be labelled free-range for 12 weeks. To be defined as free range in the UK, a chicken must normally be at least 56 days old before slaughter and have had access to outside space for at least half that time. Premium free-range eggs currently represent 56% of UK retail egg sales – the highest proportion of any European country – whereas just 2% of eggs are from the barn system. Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser with the National Farmers' Union, urged all farmers to comply with the new rules. Due to a number of confirmed avian influenza cases, the introduction of these new housing measures is a logical next step to best protect poultry. These new measures mean that every poultry keeper, whether you have one hen in the garden or a large poultry business, must house their birds indoors and I would urge everyone with poultry to take these measures seriously. It's crucial that everyone remains vigilant and reports any signs of disease in their birds at the earliest opportunity. On Sunday, all 10,500 turkeys at a farm in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, were culled after an outbreak was spotted on Saturday, while a 3km (2-mile) and 10km temporary control zone was put in place to stop the disease spreading. About 13,500 birds were culled earlier this month following confirmation of an avian flu outbreak at a commercial farm in Helsby, near Frodsham in Cheshire. Defra reiterated that the risk to human health and food safety from the virus was very low. UK and European farmers have been on alert after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. In a joint statement, Great Britain's three chief vets said: We have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease and are now planning to introduce a legal requirement for bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds. We have not taken this decision lightly, but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease. A spokesman for the British Egg Industry Council said: To date there have been no cases of avian flu in free-range laying flocks; however it is vital that we continue to protect the health and welfare of the UK's laying flock and commercial poultry operations. The requirement to keep birds inside from 14 December is a further step to those already taken to continue to protect flocks. It is the first time in four years that a so-called housing order has been imposed on the UK poultry sector due to a significant outbreak of bird flu, when measures were put in place from December 2016 to May 2017.

It applies not only to large commercial poultry farms but also smaller farmers with hens in coops or garden pens. Lockdown and the shift towards 'self-sufficiency' has triggered a huge surge in interest by individuals in keeping birds and there is concern that many may have scant regard or understanding of the importance of biosecurity measures. The restrictions will apply to chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants. No end date for the measures has yet been given, and Defra said they would be kept under 'regular review.' Eggs can continue to be marketed and labelled as 'free-range' for 16 weeks from today, but if restrictions last longer they must be downgraded to 'barn produced' using stickers on packaging. Similarly, poultry meat can be labelled free-range for 12 weeks.

Among commercial producers preparing for the new restrictions is Alastaire Brice, who runs Havensfield Happy Hens—currently with 160,000 laying hens in 22 flocks across farms in Norfolk and Suffolk. The current lockdown comes as no surprise, Brice told the East Anglian Daily Times: 'It's expected, bearing in mind the sporadic cases that have been going on up and down the country. Last year, they had a reprieve when bird flu didn't arrive in the country but this year it started with a bang.' It can take longer to get older flocks to adjust to coming indoors, he explained, with hens vulnerable to anxiety or aggression.

Nagy Awad, head of the veterinary agency in the southwestern province of al-Wadi al-Gedid, said Sunday that avian influenza was detected in two poultry farms in the villages of Ezab el-Qasr and Oweina in the Dakhla Oasis, located over 750 kilometers (470 miles) from the capital, Cairo. He said the infected birds were culled and authorities have carried out medical examinations of people who were in contact with them. The virus, which is mainly spread through contact with infected animals, can cause severe illness or death in humans. Egypt suffered a major outbreak of bird flu in 2006 that led to the suspension of all poultry exports. Authorities have been pressing to renew them, and earlier this year, the World Organization for Animal Health, an intergovernmental body, had declared Egypt free of bird flu for the first time in 14 years. The H5N1 strain of bird flu spread in early 2000s in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, leading to the slaughter of tens of millions of chickens and ducks. Hundreds of people were infected, many of whom died, according to the World Health Organization. Egypt is at high risk because many of its poultry farms are in residential areas. Many Egyptians also raise pigeons and chickens at home to supplement their income. Even in dense urban areas, birds are kept on rooftops, balconies and courtyards.

The country's Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying issued an alert on Wednesday, urging states to take measures to avoid any further spread of the disease. The southern state of Kerala ordered the culling of more than 38,000 poultry birds on Tuesday after reports of dead birds infected with the disease emerged in two districts, according to the state's Minister for Animal Husbandry, K. Raju. \"Nineteen rapid response teams have been formed for this,\" Raju said. About 17,000 birds have been culled in Kerala so far, and eggs have also been destroyed in some districts. The northern state of Himachal Pradesh reported the death of more than 3,000 birds from the disease, mostly bar-headed geese at a wildlife sanctuary, according to Archana Sharma, a senior official in the state forest department. \"The birds affected are migratory birds. All we can do is follow the strategy of clearing up the area of contamination. We comb the entire area of the sanctuary and we physically send 10 teams every day who search for any dead birds and dispose of them,\" Sharma said. The alert comes as India continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 10.3 million people in the country, and is about to embark on one of the most ambitious mass vaccination programs ever undertaken. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually only affects birds. There are many different strains, but the most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called Influenza A (H5N1), or the H5N1 virus. In India, the disease spreads mostly through migratory birds entering the country during the winter season. Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. There have been no reports of avian flu transmitting to people in India so far during this outbreak. \"There is no need to panic,\" Minister of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Giriraj Singh, told public service broadcaster Doordarshan on Wednesday. \"We also provide compensation to farmers for the birds that have to be culled.\" Other countries in Asia have also experienced outbreaks of bird flu this winter. In November, hundreds of thousands of chickens were culled in Japan after cases of avian flu were detected in poultry.

French producers of foie gras have called for a mass preventive cull of ducks to try to halt the spread of a severe strain of bird flu that is ripping through poultry farms in the south-west of the country. The highly pathogenic H5N8 virus was first detected in a bird in a pet shop on the Mediterranean island of Corsica in November before spreading to duck farms on the mainland in December. Several European countries have reported cases of infection, five years after a major outbreak prompted the slaughter of millions of ducks in France. \"The virus is stronger than us. New clusters are constantly emerging,\" the head of France's CIFOQ federation of foie gras producers, Marie-Pierre Pe, told Agence France-Presse. The number of outbreaks in France had now risen to 124, the ministry of agriculture said on Thursday, adding that about 350,000 ducks had been slaughtered since 24 December. Earlier this week the government's chief veterinary officer, Loic Evain, said more than 200,000 ducks had already been slaughtered and that a further 400,000 birds were set to be culled, out of about 35 million reared each year. He described the virus, which is not harmful to humans, as \"very, very contagious.\" Officials in Belgium said on Thursday they had culled three contaminated poultry flocks: one in Menin, in the west of the country, another in Dinant in the south and a third in Dixmude in western Flanders. Belgium's federal food safety agency AFSCA, which has ordered poultry owners to lock up their animals to avoid contamination, said that 20 cases of the virus had been found in wild birds. Herve Dupouy, a French producer who heads the local poultry section of the FNSEA farmers federation in the Landes department, a bastion of the foie gras industry, said \"The situation is out of control.\" He called on the state to cull all poultry flocks in the area and impose a two-month production freeze. \"There's no other solution,\" he said. So far the authorities have been culling all ducks and geese within a three-kilometre radius of an infected flock. Free-range chickens and turkeys within that range have also been slaughtered. CIFOQ said on Thursday that government officials had shared plans to expand the culls over a wider area. The bird flu clusters have been detected on poultry farms and in pet shops in the Landes department and the neighbouring Gers and Pyrenees-Atlantique departments. The head of France's chamber of agriculture, Sebastien Windsor, called on Wednesday for \"radical measures\" to try to restore confidence in export markets such as China which announced this week it was suspending French poultry imports over the virus. Producers of foie gras, a pate made from the livers of force-fed ducks or geese, fear a repeat of the devastation wrought by two previous waves of bird flu in the winters of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. More than 25m ducks were culled in the first outbreak, followed by 4.5m the following year, causing a steep decline in foie gras production. Besides France and Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain and Ireland have also reported bird flu outbreaks since the winter began. Dutch authorities culled 190,000 chickens in November after the discovery of the virus at two farms. Outbreaks have also been reported in India and South Korea. In India, tens of thousands of poultry will be slaughtered after an outbreak of deadly avian influenza was found to have killed scores of birds across the country. At least six Indian states have stepped up efforts this week to contain two strains of bird flu H5N1 and H5N8 after the deaths of thousands of migratory birds, ducks, crows and chickens.

{"id": "18", "title": "Bird flu: humans infected with H5N8 strain for first time in Russia", "date": "2021-02-20", "fulltext": "Seven poultry workers found to be infected, but no evidence of transmission between humans A H5N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, among seven workers who were infected at a Russian poultry plant in December. There is no evidence of the strain being transmitted between humans, but Russia has reported the transmission to the World Health Organization. The workers now feel well, and the situation did not develop further according to Dr Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor. She said the workers had been infected during an outbreak of the strain at the plant. Outbreaks of the strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East and north Africa in recent months, but only in poultry. Other strains of bird flu, including H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2, have been transmitted to humans before. The H5N8 strain is deadly for birds, and this marks the first transmission of the strain from animals to humans. While Popova said the strain didn’t appear to be able to spread among humans, only time will tell how soon future mutations will allow it to overcome this barrier. The discovery of this strain gives us all, the whole world, time to prepare for possible mutations and the possibility to react in a timely way and develop test systems and vaccines, she said. The Vector Institute in Siberia said on Saturday that it would start developing human tests and a vaccine against H5N8, according to RIA news agency. Speaking on state TV, Popova said that Russia had reported the developments to the WHO several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results. Most cases of human bird flu infections have been linked to direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered safe. The cases tend to be spread via migrating wild birds, leading producing countries to keep their poultry indoors or segregated from wildlife. Outbreaks of bird flu often lead poultry plants to kill their birds to prevent the virus spreading further, and often prompts other countries to impose trade restrictions. In the UK, five outbreaks of the H5N8 strain in Gloucestershire, Dorset, Devon, Cheshire and Kent were detected in November, leading officials to implement a prevention zone in England, Scotland and Wales.

{"id": "20", "title": "A New Bird Flu Jumps to Humans. So Far, It� Not a Problem.", "date": "2021-04-21", "fulltext": "Covid fuels the current virus pandemic, but the world is full of flu viruses waiting in the wings. And they keep changing unpredictably. When a bird flu virus struck a major poultry farm in Russia earlier this year, it was a reminder that the coronavirus causing the pandemic was not the only dangerous virus out there. The authorities quickly tested the birds and moved into high gear, killing 800,000 chickens, disposing of the carcasses and cleaning the farm to stop the potential spread to other chicken farms. But they were also concerned for humans. They tested the birds and sequenced the virus, determining that it was the H5N8 strain of avian flu, highly dangerous to both wild and domestic birds. It is established in Asia and has been increasingly causing deadly outbreaks in birds in Europe. H5N8 viruses have infected some poultry flocks in the United States, but the viruses come from a different though related lineage of virus, distinct from the current H5N8 viruses in Asia and Europe. Flu viruses combine and mutate frequently in unpredictable ways. In the short period from Dec. 25, 2020, to Jan. 14 of this year, more than seven million birds were lost to H5N8 outbreaks in Europe and Asia. Europe alone had 135 outbreaks among poultry and 35 among wild birds. Of course, to put the numbers in context, humans consume about 65 billion chickens each year, and one estimate puts the number of chickens on the globe at any one time at 23 billion. As damaging as H5N8 has been to birds, it had never infected people. Until February. The Russian health authorities also tested about 200 of the people involved in the cleanup of the farm in Astrakhan, using nasal swabs and later blood tests for antibodies. They reported that for the first time, H5N8 had jumped to people. Seven of the workers appeared to have been infected with the virus, although none of them became ill. Only one of those seven cases, however, was confirmed by genetically sequencing the virus. Nonetheless, the potential danger of the new virus and its jump to humans set off alarm bells for Dr. Daniel R. Lucey, a physician and a specialist in pandemics at Georgetown University. He began writing about the Astrakhan event in a blog for other infectious disease experts as soon as it was publicized. He reported that during a television interview, a Russian public health official said the H5N8 virus was likely to evolve into human-to-human transmission. That possibility was frightening. 'The W.H.O. finally put out a report Feb. 26,' he said. But it did not frame the event as particularly alarming because the virus was not causing human disease, and the report judged the risk of human-to-human transmission as low, despite the Russian official's comment. To Dr. Lucey, no one else seemed to be taking the infection of humans with H5N8 as 'of any concern.' He added, 'I think it's of concern.' Other scientists said they were not as worried. Dr. Florian Krammer, a flu researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, said he was more concerned about other avian flu viruses like H5N1 that have already shown themselves to be dangerous to people. Another avian influenza virus, H7N9, infected people for the first time in 2013. There have been more than 1,500 confirmed cases and more than 600 deaths since then. Since 2017 there have been only three confirmed cases and the virus does not jump easily from person to person. It is always possible that any virus can evolve human-to-human transmission, as well as become more dangerous. But H5N8 would have both hurdles to jump. Compared to other viral threats, Dr. Krammer said, 'I'm not worried.' Dr. Richard J. Webby, a flu specialist at the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and director of the W.H.O.'s Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that all of the H5 viruses are of concern because some of them have infected and killed people. But, he said, 'They all have the same sort of binding capacity to human cells, which is limited,' he said. Flu viruses use a slightly different way to attach to cells in birds than to cells in humans and being good at one usually means not being good at the other. Dr. Webby also said that while seven infections would certainly be of concern, only one infection has been confirmed. The tests of the other six involved nasal swabs and blood antibody tests. In people with no symptoms, he said, nasal swabs can simply indicate that they had breathed in virus. That would not mean it had infected them. Blood antibody tests also have a potential for error, he said, and may not be able to distinguish exposure to one flu virus from another. Nor did he see any scientific basis for suggesting that H5N8 is more likely than any other bird flu to evolve human-to-human transmission. But any virus could evolve that ability. Dr. Lucey said that he was heartened to see that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had prepared a candidate vaccine for H5N8 before it had infected humans. Candidate vaccines are simply first steps in planning for potential problems, and have not been through any testing. They exist for many viruses. 'Humans should be routinely tested for the virus, right at the time of the outbreak in birds,' Dr. Lucey said. He favors the protocol followed in Astrakhan, and argues that for any outbreak among birds, public health authorities should test people who are exposed to sick birds with nasopharyngeal swabs and an antibody test, followed by other antibody tests a few weeks later. An upcoming editorial in the journal Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease also takes up the Astrakhan incident and calls for increased monitoring of all H5 viruses.

What we know.", "date": "2021-06-01", "fulltext": "A man in eastern China may be the first confirmed human case of infection with the H10N3 strain of bird flu, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said Tuesday. The 41-year-old man from Jiangsu province, located northwest of Shanghai, was hospitalized April 28 after developing fever and other symptoms. He was diagnosed with the infection on May 28, according to Reuters, but is now stable and ready to be discharged from the hospital. The health commission said the infection was a result of accidental cross-species transmission. The risk of widespread transmission is low, Chinese officials said, and there are no other human cases of H10N3 reported elsewhere in the world. Avian influenza Type A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds and have been found in more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While these viruses don't normally infect humans, birds can shed virus in their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC says. Human infections can occur if enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth. The CDC says two strains of bird flu viruses have been mostly responsible for human infection and mortality: H7N9 and H5N1. Symptoms of avian influenza A virus infections can range from mild to severe and include conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness such as fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches. Symptoms can also be accompanied by nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and severe respiratory illness, according to the CDC. While it's possible for some of these viruses to jump from birds to humans, they so far don't have the capability of transmitting between humans, said Jürgen Richt, a professor at Kansas State University and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases with the National Institutes of Health. Alpha, Beta, Delta: WHO renames COVID-19 variants with Greek letter names to avoid confusion, stigma COVID origins: Biden tells intelligence agencies to step up probe of COVID-19's origins, including theory of Wuhan lab leak 'This is our biggest fear,' said Richt, who also directs the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases for the Department of Homeland Security. 'If they were to transmit human to human, then we would be at a worse situation than COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates.' This is because bird flu strains can be particularly deadly among human populations. According to the World Health Organization, the case-fatality rate of H7N9 is roughly 30%; H5N1 is 60%. It may be unlikely the H10N3 strain can transmit between humans, Richt said, but scientists can't know for sure until they learn its genetic code and conduct epidemiological surveillance to determine if any other contacts were infected. 'The reason for that is that avian influenza viruses spread among avian species using different receptors than mammalian influenza viruses,' he said. 'In order for these viruses to transmit (among humans), the virus needs to adapt. There're several adaptation steps and, so far, this has not happened with avian flu viruses.'

{"id": "23", "title": "China finds possible first human case of H10N3 bird flu strain", "date": "2021-06-01", "fulltext": "The Chinese government announced Tuesday that a man in Jiangsu province, northwest of Shanghai, had become the first person known to have been infected with the H10N3 strain of bird flu. In a statement, China's National Health Commission emphasized that there was no evidence that the strain had the ability to spread among humans, adding that the risk of a significant outbreak was 'very low.' The patient, a 41-year-old man who lives in the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalized April 28 after having fever symptoms, the National Health Commission said. He was diagnosed with H10N3 a month later. Though the man remains under medical supervision, his condition was described as stable and meeting the standards for discharge. It was not clear from the statement how he caught the virus. The news of the H10N3 infection comes amid the devastation of the covid-19 pandemic, which also was first identified in China and is widely thought to have come to humans from bats through some form of zoonotic spread. A different strain of bird flu, known as H7N9, led to the deaths of around 300 people during an outbreak between 2016 and 2017. But varieties of avian influenza are common in China and, due to increased surveillance of the viruses, relatively easy to find in humans. Unlike in H7N9, there is no evidence that H10N3 can spread easily among humans. 'The more we look for novel viruses as a cause of illness among patients the more we are likely to find them,' Gregory Gray, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Duke University, told the South China Morning Post. Alexandra Phelan, a global health lawyer at Georgetown University's Center for Global Health Science and Security, wrote on Twitter that people should be 'alert but not alarmed' about the news, adding that spillover between species did not itself mean there was epidemic risk. China's National Health Commission also said that H10N3 caused less severe illness among birds. Chinese authorities placed all the man's close contacts under medical observation and said the contacts did not display any 'abnormalities.'

A 41-year-old man in China's eastern Jiangsu Province is the first known human to be infected with a strain of bird flu known as H10N3, China's National Health Commission said on Tuesday—a development that experts said merited close monitoring because of an underlying continued risk of pandemic flus. Avian viruses do not typically spread among humans, but they can pose a danger if they mix with a human virus, said Raina MacIntyre, the head of the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Australia. 'If someone has human flu and is infected with bird flu, the two viruses can swap genetic material,' she said. 'That's why you see the concern for pandemic flu arising in countries where humans and livestock have very close contact.' The Health Commission's announcement said that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission in the Jiangsu case.

He was diagnosed with the infection on May 28, according to Reuters, but is now stable and ready to be discharged from the hospital. The health commission said the infection was a result of accidental cross-species transmission. The risk of widespread transmission is low, Chinese officials said, and there are no other human cases of H10N3 reported elsewhere in the world. Avian influenza Type A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds and have been found in more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While these viruses don't normally infect humans, birds can shed virus in their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC says. Human infections can occur if enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth. While it's possible for some of these viruses to jump from birds to humans, they so far don't have the capability of transmitting between humans, said Jürgen Richt, a professor at Kansas State University and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases with the National Institutes of Health. \"This is our biggest fear,\" said Richt, who also directs the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases for the Department of Homeland Security. \"If they were to transmit human to human, then we would be at a worse situation than COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates.\" This is because bird flu strains can be particularly deadly among human populations. According to the World Health Organization, the case-fatality rate of H7N9 is roughly 30%; H5N1 is 60%.

{"id": "27", "title": "What Is Going on With Bird Flu? China Reports First Human Case of H10N3 Strain", "date": "2021-06-04", "fulltext": "Chinese health authorities said a 41-year-old man had contracted a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3 and had been in the hospital since late April, calling it the first reported human case globally from the strain. The National Health Commission said the man developed a fever and other symptoms on April 23 and was admitted to hospital in Jiangsu province five days later. On Tuesday the health commission said his condition was stable and indicated he was ready to be discharged. How did the man become infected? The health commission didn't give details on how the man came into contact with the virus. Cases of bird flu in humans have most commonly been reported among those in close daily contact with poultry, such as chicken farmers. The commission advised the public to avoid contact with sick and dead poultry. Can bird flu kill people? Avian influenza can be fatal in humans. Highly pathogenic strains, such as H5N1, can have a mortality rate of about 60%, according to the World Health Organization. However, the WHO says, bird flu doesn't spread easily from birds to people. How common are bird-flu outbreaks in China? China has seen several outbreaks of bird flu, including one at the height of the coronavirus outbreak last year, when H5N1 avian influenza killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds. In May, China's Agriculture Ministry said the H5N8 strain of bird flu killed hundreds of wild birds in Tibet, prompting authorities to disinfect areas including a national wetland park. Are authorities worried? China said the risk of a large-scale outbreak was extremely low. It said local health authorities' contact-tracing and monitoring efforts had found no other cases and no human-to-human transmission. It said the H10N3 strain doesn't have the ability to effectively infect humans. What do experts say? Human infections with bird-flu viruses are rare but not uncommon, said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, a professor at the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. 'It is highly likely that this infection just represents one of the rare incidents of human infection with an avian influenza virus, without any more consequences,' said Prof. Garcia-Sastre. 'Nevertheless, it's important to make sure that this is just that, a rare isolated incident.' The fact that the case happened in April and there hasn't been any other reports of cases suggests there hasn't been a cluster of infections, says Peng Shifang, a professor of infectious diseases at Central South University in China's Hunan province. Is China upfront about the recent bird-flu case? China said it had determined on May 28 through genome sequencing that the man suffered from the H10N3 strain. It issued its statement on the results on Tuesday. While China has been criticized for a lack of transparency in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, its public-health apparatus is generally seen as having become more transparent since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, when official secrecy hampered the response.

A man has been hospitalized in southwestern China after contracting the H5N6 strain of avian flu, Chinese state news media reported on Thursday, a reminder that the world is full of flu viruses even during a coronavirus pandemic. The man, 55, was hospitalized in Bazhong, a city in the southwestern province of Sichuan, after coming down with a fever and testing positive for the virus on July 6, the state-run China Global Television Network reported. Local officials had activated an emergency response and sterilized the area, the broadcaster said in a brief report in English. It cited unnamed experts as saying that the risk of large-scale transmission among humans was low. The report did not provide other details or say whether the man handled poultry as part of his job. The H5N6 virus is one of several potentially dangerous flu versions that scientists have reported finding over the years in poultry flocks or in captured or dead wild birds. It was first detected eight years ago in Laos, and later spread to China and other countries. As of last week, 32 confirmed cases of human infection with the H5N6 virus, and 19 deaths, had been reported to the World Health Organization in Asia since 2014, according to the agency.

{"id": "29", "title": "Bird flu prevention zone declared across Great Britain", "date": "2021-11-04", "fulltext": "Bird keepers required to follow strict biosecurity measures after outbreaks in poultry in Dundee and Wrexham. A bird flu prevention zone has been declared across Great Britain to stop the spread of the disease among poultry and other birds. Since 5pm on Wednesday, all bird keepers have been legally required to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks. On Wednesday a flock of poultry was culled near Dundee in Scotland after a bird flu outbreak. Earlier this week cases were detected in wild birds and poultry in Wrexham, Wales. The disease has been detected in wild birds at multiple sites across Great Britain. Bird flu circulates naturally among wild birds, and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe in winter the disease can be spread to poultry and other captive birds. In advice published on the Defra website, UK health agencies and food standards agencies say the risk to public health from the virus is very low. According to the NHS, bird flu can affect humans in rare cases if people touch infected birds, their droppings or bedding, or while preparing infected poultry for cooking. Under the prevention zone, people with more than 500 birds must now restrict access for non-essential visitors, change clothing and footwear before entering enclosures, and ensure vehicles are cleaned and disinfected regularly. Areas where birds are kept must be kept unattractive to wild birds, for example by netting ponds and removing food sources. Small backyard owners with only a small number of birds, including chicken, ducks and geese, have been told to limit risks and keep watch for signs of disease. In a joint statement, the chief veterinary officers for England, Scotland and Wales said all bird keepers had to take action. Following a number of detections of avian influenza in wild birds across Great Britain we have declared an avian influenza prevention zone across the whole of Great Britain, the statement said.

The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has put the poultry industry on alert after previous outbreaks led to the culling of tens of millions of birds. It is attracting the attention too of epidemiologists as the virus can be transmitted to humans. China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza so far this year, more than in the whole of 2020. South Korea reported an outbreak at a farm of around 770,000 poultry in Chungcheongbuk-do, the OIE said on Monday, citing a report from the South Korean authorities. All animals were slaughtered. Also in Asia, Japan reported its first outbreak of the 2021 winter season, at a poultry farm in the north-east of the country, the OIE said, confirming a statement last week by Japan's agriculture ministry. The serotype in this outbreak was H5N8. In Europe, Norway reported an H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the Rogaland region in a flock of 7,000 birds, the OIE said. Bird flu circulates naturally among wild birds, and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe in winter the disease can be spread to poultry and other captive birds. The Belgian government put the country on increased risk for bird flu, ordering poultry to be kept indoors as of Monday, after a highly pathogenic variant of bird flu was identified in a wild goose near Antwerp. This followed a similar move in neighbouring France earlier this month and in the Netherlands in October. Earlier this month, a bird flu prevention zone was declared across Great Britain, legally requiring all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures after a flock of poultry was culled near Dundee in Scotland in response to a bird flu outbreak.

{"id": "32", "title": "Minister confirms UK has been hit by record bird flu outbreak", "date": "2021-12-09", "fulltext": "George Eustice says restrictions in place since start of November require all birds to be kept indoors The UK has been hit by a record outbreak of avian flu that has led to 500,000 captive birds being culled in recent months. The environment secretary, George Eustice, told the House of Commons: 'This year we are now seeing the largest ever outbreak in the UK of avian influenza, with 36 confirmed cases.' He said an avian influenza prevention zone had been declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. He added: 'Our chief veterinary officer continues to lead the response to this episode.' Earlier the chief vet, Christine Middlemiss, said she was 'very concerned about what's happening.' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme after confirming more outbreaks overnight, she said: 'We now have a total of 40 infected premises in the UK. That's a really high number for the time of year for anything we've experienced before.' By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. Middlemiss said: 'All the birds on the premises have to be culled because of the ongoing risk of infection that they pose. The total number is something like half a million will now have been culled.' She said food supplies would not be hit. 'That sounds a huge number, and for those keepers affected it is really devastating, but it's a relatively very small number in terms of egg supply, meat, chicken and so on.' The disease is spread by migratory wild birds from Europe, where high infections levels are also being recorded. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive for avian flu, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland's Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected avian flu case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on Trotternish, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Middlemiss said almost 300 wild birds had been found with the disease at more than 80 locations. There was 'a lot of virus out there,' she said. The risk to human health is low but infected birds should not be touched. She said: 'It used to be that we would have a reasonable-sized outbreak and then have two or three quiet years. But that's not happening now. We're seeing this across the whole of Europe. We need to understand better why we're getting these ongoing infections every year.' Asked if the disease was still spreading, Middlemiss said: 'We're continuing to get the new detections. I confirmed another two last night and that's the rate we've been going at for the last week or so. We're seeing this as a huge pressure of infection from our wild birds.' Middlemiss urged people with garden bird feeders to 'practice routine hygiene precautions including proper handwashing.' She added: 'If you keep chickens and you want to feed wild birds, you need to make sure that everything is completely scrupulously clean and absolutely separate so that you don't take infection into your own birds and make them sick.' Asked if the climate crisis was to blame for the increased infection, Middlemiss said: 'We don't know specifically, but it's certainly one of the thoughts that our experts are having. The birds migrate to the north of Russia over the summer and mix with other birds on other global flight pathways and exchange the viruses. So it's quite plausible that with climate change and change in pathways that different mixing is going on.'", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "The disease is spread by migratory wild birds from Europe, where high infections levels are also being recorded.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "We're continuing to get the new detections.

{"id": "33", "title": "What is bird flu and why is it back in the news?", "date": "2021-12-09", "fulltext": "With the UK hit by a record outbreak, here's a quick guide to the viral disease also known as avian influenza. What is avian flu? Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a contagious viral disease in animals, caused by a virus loosely related to human influenza. Some strains of the disease have been passed to humans but this is very rare, and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals. While all bird species and, less commonly, pigs are thought to be susceptible, domestic poultry flocks are especially vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks can rapidly result in epidemics among bird populations. Public health authorities are concerned about the potential of the virus to mutate into subtypes capable of causing human disease. As a result, they warn there is always a threat of a new influenza pandemic emerging. Why is it in the news again? The UK has been hit by a record outbreak that has resulted in 500,000 captive birds being culled this autumn. An avian influenza prevention zone was declared across the UK at the start of November, requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors. What are the most dangerous strains? The NHS says there are four strains that have caused particular concern in recent years. The first, identified in 1997, was H5N1, followed by H7N9 in 2013, H5N6 the following year, and H5N8 in 2016. The H5N1 form has been the cause of most concern in recent years and the UK government has said particular safety measures were put in place in parts of North Yorkshire on 21 November after confirmed and suspected cases of that strain in poultry in the area. Where has it appeared? The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, has said there are 40 infected premises in the UK. They include 38 in Great Britain, of which 33 are in England, and two in Northern Ireland. By comparison, there were 26 outbreaks last winter. A rare white-tailed eagle found dead on Skye is among the wild birds to have tested positive, after a postmortem by the pathology unit at Scotland's Rural College. It is thought to be the first detected case involving an eagle in Scotland. The adult eagle, from a well-established territory on the Trotternish peninsula, was found dead on 14 November. Ornithologists believe it may have fed on infected greylag geese. Some 22,100 ducks were culled at a commercial premises in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, while culling and an exclusion zone was also being applied to a second site in Broughshane, Co Antrim, described as a 'small backyard flock.' If it just affects birds, why the panic? It doesn't. World Health Organization (WHO) figures show that from 2003 to 2021 there were 863 confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus in humans. Of these cases, 456 people died. While transmission is rare, it has happened. So far, most of the human deaths have been in countries in Asia, in communities in which people live in close proximity to poultry. Although it does not easily infect humans, every time it does it increases the chance that the virus could mutate into a form that could be passed from one infected human to another. The WHO fears this could lead to a flu pandemic. How do you catch bird flu? It is very unlikely you will catch the virus unless you have been in close contact with infected birds or someone with confirmed or suspected bird flu. The virus is found in secretions from the eyes and respiratory tract, and droppings of infected birds. Humans can catch the virus by inhaling droplets sneezed by infected birds or the dust from their bedding or droppings. What are the symptoms in humans? They vary depending on the strain. Most infections have flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and aches and pains. Symptoms of the H5N1 subtype are more severe and frequently result in death. Other symptoms can include conjunctivitis, red, sore and discharging eyes. How does it spread? WHO scientists have said they believe it is likely the virus is carried by migrating birds. More recently the UK government has said it spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. Officials added: 'It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear. Avian influenza isn't an airborne virus.' It can spread to humans who touch infected birds, droppings or bedding or who kill or prepare infected poultry for cooking, the NHS has said. People cannot catch bird flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas affected by an outbreak, health officials have said. What measures is the UK taking? The government has said the chief veterinary officers for each of the UK's constituent nations have agreed to bring in new housing measures to protect poultry and captive birds from avian influenza following a number of confirmed cases across Great Britain in recent weeks. It added: 'The new housing measures, which will come into force on Monday 29 November, mean that it will be a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.' How do you spot the virus in birds? Symptoms in infected birds include a swollen head and blue discoloration around the neck and throat. They will also show signs of breathing problems including gaping beaks, coughing, sneezing and rattling wheezing. Poultry farmers will also notice a loss of appetite in the infected birds and a decrease in egg laying. People are advised not to touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds they find. In Great Britain, dead wild waterfowl or other wild birds should be reported to Defra. Some will then be collected and tested to help scientists understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird. What drug treatments are available to humans? There is no vaccine for avian flu. If a person were infected, the NHS has said they would be either told to stay at home or put into isolation in hospital. They would then be treated with an antiviral medicine such as oseltamivir (known as Tamiflu) or zanamivir (known as Relenza). Scientists have found that such treatments help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival.

{"id": "34", "title": "UK reports unprecedented jump in early season bird flu cases", "date": "2021-12-09", "fulltext": "LONDON (AP) — U.K. authorities reported an unprecedented jump in early season cases of avian flu in both domestic and wild birds, triggering tight restrictions on poultry farmers across the country. The government has confirmed 40 outbreaks of avian flu among poultry and other captive birds this year, resulting in the culling of about 500,000 birds, Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said Thursday. There were 24 outbreaks during the entire 2020-21 bird flu season, which ran through the spring. “I’m very concerned about what’s happening,” Middlemiss told the BBC. “That’s a really high number for the time of year for anything we’ve experienced before, and that’s because of the high level of infection in the migratory wild birds. So it’s really, really concerning because those birds will stay with us over the winter until early spring and the risk of infection remains.” U.K. authorities keep a close eye on avian flu cases around the world because it is spread by migrating birds and can be devastating to poultry producers. Experts estimate that outbreaks during the 2014-15 and 2016-17 seasons cost U.K. poultry producers about 125 million pounds ($165 million). While the risk to humans is low, bird flu can affect people in rare cases. To control the spread of the disease, poultry producers must kill all birds at sites where infections are confirmed. In addition, they have been ordered to keep all birds inside or under nets to stop them from coming in contact with wild fowl, and to implement strict hygiene measures. While the number of birds culled so far this season sounds large, it is relatively small compared with the number of birds on U.K. poultry farms. Between the beginning of August and the end of October, poultry producers slaughtered about 20 million birds a week, according to the latest government statistics. “In terms of food supply impact, it’s actually a relatively small number,” Middlemiss said of flu-related culling. The situation in Britain is part of a larger trend across Europe, where authorities are seeing more frequent outbreaks of avian flu, Middlemiss said. Although researchers don’t know the reasons for the trend, one theory is that climate change has altered the migration patterns of wild birds, she said. “The birds migrate to the north of Russia over the summer and mix with other birds and other global flight pathways there and they exchange the viruses, so it’s quite plausible that with climate change and change in pathways different mixing is going on,” Middlemiss said. “But that hasn’t been fully investigated yet.”", "media_outlet": "AP", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "While the risk to humans is low, bird flu can affect people in rare cases.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The birds migrate to the north of Russia over the summer and mix with other birds and other global flight pathways there and they exchange the viruses, so it’s quite plausible that with climate change and change in pathways different mixing is going on.", "affirm_why_count": 1, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "While the risk to humans is low, bird flu can affect people in rare cases.", "deny_transmissible_count": 1, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

Uri Naveh, a senior scientist at the Israel Parks and Nature Authority, said the situation is not yet under control. \"Many of the birds are dead in the middle of the water body so it's difficult for them to be taken out,\" he said Monday. Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg called the crisis \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country.\" \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" she tweeted. Yaron Michaeli, spokesman for the Hula Lake park, where the crane population is centered, said workers were removing the carcasses as quickly as possible, fearing they could infect other wildlife. Dafna Yurista, spokeswoman for the Agriculture Ministry, said half a million chickens in the area were being slaughtered to prevent the disease from spreading. About 500,000 cranes pass through Israel each year on the way to Africa and a small number stay behind, Michaeli said. This year, an estimated 30,000 cranes stayed in Israel for the winter. Michaeli said it is believed that the cranes were infected by smaller birds that had contact with farms suffering from outbreaks. Israeli media carried photos of workers in white hazmat suits collecting crane carcasses after the birds were first found to be sick about 10 days ago. Michaeli said the death toll among cranes appears to have stabilized in recent days. \"This is a good sign,\" he said. \"They might be starting to get over this. We hope very much.\" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said officials from the agriculture, environment and health ministries were monitoring the situation.

{"id": "37", "title": "Bird flu outbreak in Israel kills more than 5,200 cranes, with mass culling of poultry underway", "date": "2021-12-28", "fulltext": "Israel is battling the coronavirus and a surge in flu cases. But it's an outbreak of the H5N1 avian flu among migratory cranes and domestic poultry that is drawing global concern. The bird flu, as it's also called, is spreading fast in northern Israel, where at least 5,200 cranes have died of the disease and hundreds of thousands of chickens have been culled in an effort to contain its advance. The avian flu is confined mostly to birds. It rarely jumps to humans, but when it does it can be lethal. As of October, the World Health Organization had confirmed 863 cases of H5N1 in people, 456 of whom died, around the world since 2003. Israel has not recorded any infections in humans this year. Those who have possibly been exposed to the virus are receiving preventive antiviral treatments. Other countries, including Britain, China, Norway and South Korea, have also reported major or higher-than-usual H5N1 outbreaks in recent months. In November, Britain declared a bird flu prevention zone, requiring all farmers to follow stricter biosecurity protocols after several outbreaks. Israel is a central stop along the route of many species of birds migrating from Europe and Asia to Africa, a convergence that raises the risk of avian flu spreading from wild birds to captive poultry populations in the country. Each year, about 500,000 cranes migrate through Israel, some 30,000 of which stayed to winter over there this year. The yearly stopover, often part of journeys lasting thousands of miles, draws the attention of bird enthusiasts, who travel to observe the large, long-legged and long-necked birds. The H5N1 outbreak has wrought \"the most serious damage to wildlife in the history of the country,\" Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg said in a tweet Sunday. She shared a photo of dead cranes peppering a lake in Israel's Hula Nature Reserve, a hot spot for migratory birds. \"The extent of the damage is still unclear,\" Zandberg said. Israel reported its first cases of bird flu in 2006, and has seen outbreaks nearly every year since, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The extent of this year's train of transmission is not yet clear, but regulations require poultry and wild birds be kept separated to limit the chance of transference. Word of Israel's latest outbreak began to spread on Dec. 19, when the Agriculture Ministry reported that H5N1 had been detected in a farming community, Margaliot, near Israel's northern border with Lebanon. The ministry said it had closed off the area and halted egg production. Crowded and unregulated chicken coops are a \"ticking bomb\" for developing diseases, Agriculture Minister Oded Feror said in a statement at the time. That same day, Israeli media reported that about 100 cranes had died in a bird flu outbreak in Hula Lake in a nature reserve in northern Israel. Authorities closed down the area to the public and days later temporarily shut the entire nature reserve. Israel's Nature and Parks Authority shared photos of workers in hazmat suits collecting the bodies of dead cranes from the water. In the following days, outbreaks were detected in at least three other farms in the north as the Agriculture Ministry underwent mass testing. The parks authority said Thursday that an estimated 1 in 5 cranes in Israel were likely to be infected with the virus, Israeli media reported. There have also been reports of deaths from the virus among other bird species. Israel's Agricultural Ministry has warned the public to buy only eggs with the required regulatory stamp and to consume thoroughly cooked eggs to prevent any further spread. The public has also been warned to keep a distance from wild birds.

{"id": "38", "title": "Israel Faces a Severe Blow to Wildlife Amid Outbreak of Avian Flu", "date": "2021-12-29", "fulltext": "Thousands of migratory cranes have died and more than half a million chickens have been culled as the country tries to contain a deadly bird virus. JERUSALEM — Israel is acting to contain a severe outbreak of avian flu that has already led to mass culling of infected poultry and has caused the deaths of about 5,000 migratory cranes in a popular nature reserve in the north of the country. The minister of environmental protection, Tamar Zandberg, described the outbreak, identified as the H5N1 type, as 'one of the worst blows to wildlife in Israel's history' after a visit to the Hula Nature Reserve this week. Hula is a wetland that is a central stop on the winter migration route to Africa. The reserve, usually bustling with bird watchers at this time of year, is temporarily closed to visitors and the Ministry of Environmental Protection said on Wednesday that Ms. Zandberg was working to suspend the rest of the hunting season in the country, which normally runs until the end of January. The fear, the ministry said, was that gunshots from bird hunters could cause the wild birds to fly off to other locations, spreading the disease, which it said could also be spread by contaminated car tires on hunters' vehicles or on the soles of their shoes, or by the dogs retrieving their prey. Officials have also warned of the danger of the transmission of avian flu from animals to humans, which could be deadly. No such cases have been recorded in Israel. The first signs of the outbreak came about two months ago, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, with infections cropping up in chicken and turkey farms in different areas of the country. Israel's minister of agriculture and rural development, Oded Forer, said about 600,000 chickens had been culled. He said that would mean a shortfall of 15 million eggs per month over the next few months and that the department was working to import millions of eggs. In an interview with Kan Radio, Israel's public broadcaster, on Tuesday, Mr. Forer blamed the outdated, overcrowded chicken coops that he said were common in Israel for the severity of the outbreak of the virus. The egg industry had been 'neglected for years,' he said, adding that most of the coops in Israel were like those from the 1950s or 60s, and that there was a need to move to more modern coops without cages. More than 100,000 cranes can gather in the Hula Valley during the migration season, which begins in October, according to the reserve, and in recent years many have sojourned there until the spring, when they move back north. The reserve said about 40,000 cranes were documented in the valley early this month. By mid-December the number of dead cranes began to mount up and avian flu was identified as the cause. Most of the dead birds have been found in the water.

The infected person is well and self-isolating, and the risk to the wider public from avian flu remains very low. Prof Isabel Oliver, the chief scientific officer at UKHSA, said: \"Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we continue to monitor the situation closely.

The first person in the UK to catch a new strain of bird flu has been named as 79-year-old Alan Gosling, a retired engineer who lived with about 20 ducks inside his home in Devon. Gosling, who had about another 100 ducks living outside on his property in Buckfastleigh, noticed several birds falling ill shortly before Christmas, Devon Live reports. Subsequent tests by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) were returned positive for the H5N1 strain of avian flu. They were subsequently killed shortly after Christmas. Gosling then tested positive for general flu virus and the H5N1 strain of avian flu, first for the strain in the UK. The risk to the wider public continues to be very low, health officials have said, but people have been urged to not touch sick or dead birds. Gosling reportedly welcomed about 20 of the birds into his home as pets after he began feeding the flock. His daughter-in-law, Ellesha Gosling, from Cranbrook, told Devon Live how Gosling begged for their lives to be spared and described the Muscovy ducks as his best friends. She said: \"The past couple of weeks have been hell for this family.

(AP) — A duck killed by a hunter in South Carolina had a contagious and dangerous bird flu that has not been detected in the wild in the U.S. in five years, officials said. The flu poses a low risk to people but can spread quickly through chicken houses and other poultry businesses. The Eurasian H5 avian influenza was first detected by Clemson University scientists and confirmed by federal testing, the school said in a news release. The U.S. Department of Agriculture alerted global health officials. Scattered Eurasian H5 infections have been detected in 2022 from Portugal to Bulgaria and in December, two cases were reported in eastern Canada, officials said. Anyone who has poultry, including backyard farms, needs to review their practices to keep birds safe from disease, said State Veterinarian Michael J. Neault, who runs Clemson University's Livestock Poultry Health program. Those practices include thoroughly washing hands before and after handling wild and domesticated birds and using gloves and other protective gear when handling live birds. Farmers should also keep their birds away from areas where geese and ducks roam, clean their cages and coops regularly and buy new birds from reputable sources and keep them away from the rest of the flock for 30 days, the university said. \"So far we have no indication that (the flu) has jumped from wild migratory birds to poultry and we'd very much like to keep it that way,\" Neault said in a statement.", "media_outlet": "AP", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The flu poses a low risk to people but can spread quickly through chicken houses and other poultry businesses.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "The Eurasian H5 avian influenza was first detected by Clemson University scientists and confirmed by federal testing, the school said in a news release.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "Scattered Eurasian H5 infections have been detected in 2022 from Portugal to Bulgaria and in December, two cases were reported in eastern Canada, officials said.", "affirm_why_count": 3, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "The flu poses a low risk to people but can spread quickly through chicken houses and other poultry businesses.", "deny_transmissible_count": 1, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

The RSPB has called for an emergency shooting ban after an 'unprecedented' outbreak of bird flu that has left wildfowl populations in 'catastrophic decline.' Migratory geese that overwinter on the Solway Firth, which stretches between Scotland and Cumbria, are being hardest hit, with a 38% decline in the Svalbard barnacle goose breeding population from winter last year. While these are protected species and not subject to hunting, experts argue that pressure from wildfowlers on nearby, legal quarry species can have an impact. Shoots nearby can cause stress, scaring the birds into the air where they use up vital energy. Some estimates suggest the UK is facing the worst outbreak of avian influenza on record. Latest population counts of the Svalbard breeding population show a drop in numbers from 43,703 in November last year to 27,133 in this month's counts. Paul Walton, the head of habitats and species at RSPB Scotland, said: 'We are in the grip of an unprecedented outbreak and unfortunately the Solway seems to be the epicentre of this in the UK. Our birds are suffering and they need an urgent reprieve to help them get through this winter and ensure that as many as possible of those remaining survive to make their migration back home to Scandinavia to breed in the summer. The best way we can do this is by reducing the cumulative impacts of disturbance, including by wildfowling. Our teams on the ground are seeing many birds that are sick or dying and under significant stress. Anything that can be done to limit activities which incur additional disturbance at this time should be implemented with urgency. This action could help these populations during this period of catastrophic decline caused by the outbreak.' There are allowances under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 for a temporary pause in the hunting of wildfowl if there are prolonged periods of freezing weather. The RSPB is asking for this consideration in the event of a severe avian influenza outbreak. It has also asked the public to keep dogs under close control in the Solway coastal area to avoid further disturbing the birds. After the barnacle goose gained protection in the 1950s, following a long campaign by conservationists, the world population rose from just a few hundred individuals to about 40,000. But the recent sharp decline has made experts concerned the good work could be undone. Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry bird flu. Many bird populations, from chickens to swans, have been hit by the flu, which is deadly.

The United States Department of Agriculture said its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza at the farm in Dubois County. State officials have quarantined the farm and its 29,000 turkeys are being euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease, said Denise Derrer Spears, a spokeswoman for the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. The USDA said turkeys from the affected farm will not enter the food supply and issued a reminder that poultry and eggs should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees (73.9 Celsius) to kill bacteria and viruses. The agency said avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S. The USDA said turkey infections are the first confirmation of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry in the U.S. since 2020. The Indiana State Board of Animal Health said samples from the farm were analyzed at the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Purdue University after about 100 turkeys died. The state agency said the farm is under quarantine and that state officials are working with the poultry producers statewide to increase monitoring of flocks.

{"id": "46", "title": "Bird flu found on poultry farm in Indiana, nearly 30,000 turkeys killed to contain spread", "date": "2022-02-11", "fulltext": "An outbreak of the bird flu has been reported on a turkey farm in southern Indiana and nearly 30,000 turkeys have already been euthanized in efforts to control the spread. This does not present an immediate concern to public health, federal officials said, but it does have agriculture and industry folks worried. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the confirmed case of the H5N1 strain of avian flu at a farm in Dubois County. It is a highly pathogenic strain, meaning it is lethal to all poultry that contract the disease. This is the nation's first confirmed case of the flu in a commercial operation since 2020 and six years since it was last found on farms in Indiana, when hundreds of thousands of birds were killed as a result. Indiana Dunes National Park: National Park Service approves first entrance fees for Indiana Dunes National Park Dolce and Gabbana drop animal fur: Dolce and Gabbana to drop use of animal fur in all fashion collections starting in 2022. 'This is a foreign animal disease and shouldn't be on our landscape,' said Denise Derrer Spears, the spokeswoman of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. 'That flips the switch and makes this a big deal right off the bat, and we need to stamp it out before it gets out of control.' The response to the outbreak has been swift, both from state and federal agencies as well as the economy. Taiwan has restricted poultry meat and egg products from Indiana while China and Korea blocked non-heated poultry meat from the state, the USDA said on its website. Though limited, these trade restrictions and loss of poultry are a blow to the farm sector and individual producers. You cannot get bird flu from eating fully cooked poultry meat or eggs, according to medical experts. This does not present a food safety risk, and the USDA said turkeys from the affected farm will not enter the food supply. 'But it's a matter of public perception,' Derrer Spears said. The current situation began on Feb. 7, when the affected farmer noticed about 100 birds were dead in one of his barns and the remaining ones were lethargic. He worked with his veterinarian to get samples collected from the flock and sent to a lab at Purdue University. The results were then confirmed at a USDA lab in Iowa. The name of the affected farm has not been publicly identified. As soon as the state received the results, it issued a quarantine at the site and all those farms within a 10-kilometer radius. That includes 17 other operations, Derrer Spears said. She could not give exact numbers on how many birds were impacted, but it's likely more than a few hundred thousand. Dubois County is the top turkey-producing county in Indiana. And Indiana is the third-largest turkey-producing state in the country, the No. 1 state in duck production and the second largest in table eggs and egg-laying chickens. All those farms within the control area will have to test their animals at least once each week to monitor for the disease. The first round of tests came back negative, Derrer Spears said, but the state is remaining very cautious. 'While it's just one incident right now, 18 farms in total are affected by this,' she added. 'There is no cure for this disease, there is no way to save the birds, all birds will die from this so we want to put them down as quickly as possible.' The control area will remain in effect until the affected farm is fully cleaned, the euthanized turkeys are disposed of and no further cases are detected. All turkeys at the infected farm, 29,000 birds, were put down by Wednesday night, according to the state. That depopulation needs to happen as quickly as possible so that the birds do not languish and so the virus does not have more time to spread. The euthanized turkeys will then be disposed of onsite by composting them, a method that is approved and overseen by state and federal agencies. The barns and all equipment will also need to be thoroughly cleaned 'flat off the floor clean,' Derrer Spears said. Once the cleaning is complete and the disposal has reached a certain stage, the quarantine will be lifted. There are many factors involved and there is no target date to do that, the state said it likely will be about four to six weeks. It is unclear how the Dubois County flock was infected. The avian flu viruses are fairly common in wild migratory birds and waterfowl, according to Derrer Spears, and ducks and geese that contract the disease will spread it in their droppings as they fly by. The strain has been wreaking havoc on Asia and Europe and also has been found in some wild birds along the East Coast. Canada recently confirmed H5N1 bird flu in a commercial poultry operation in Nova Scotia.

Indiana on Wednesday reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu on a commercial turkey farm, leading China, South Korea and Mexico to ban poultry imports from the state, and putting the industry on edge at a time that labor shortages are fueling food inflation. The disease is already widespread in Europe and affecting Africa, Asia and Canada, but the outbreak in Indiana, which is on a migratory bird pathway, particularly rattled U.S. producers. A devastating U.S. bird flu outbreak in 2015 killed nearly 50 million birds, mostly turkeys and egg-laying chickens in the Midwest. The United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government. \"Everyone is just sitting on edge because we know what can happen and we don't want a repeat of that,\" said Denise Heard, vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association, an industry group. Poultry company Perdue Farms suspended in-person visits to farms to avoid spreading the disease, spokeswoman Diana Souder said. Advisers are instead communicating with farmers via phone and email to reinforce protocols, and monitor birds' health, she said. \"When you are dealing with a confirmed case now in the country, we know there is heightened risk,\" said Mike Naig, Iowa's agriculture secretary. \"It's time to move to a higher alert for our livestock producers.\" Disease experts said a wild bird probably spread the H5N1 virus to Indiana from the East Coast, where officials have confirmed that wild ducks were infected with the strain. The U.S. Agriculture Department called the disease low risk to humans. Reuters OPEC's low output strains oil market Global oil prices could climb further because of the OPEC Plus coalition's \"chronic\" struggle to revive production, unless the group's Middle Eastern heavyweights pump extra to compensate, the International Energy Agency warned.

The USDA reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a flock of about 240,000 birds at a commercial chicken farm in Fulton County, Ky. Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. chicken processor by sales, confirmed that the farm housed the company's chickens. A separate outbreak was confirmed in a backyard flock of birds in Fauquier County, Va., the USDA said. State officials quarantined the affected areas, and the birds on the farms will be destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease. Federal and state authorities are surveilling and testing areas around the affected flocks, the USDA said. None of the affected birds will enter the food supply, according to the USDA. Recent avian-influenza outbreaks haven't posed a health risk to humans, federal officials have said. A severe outbreak in the U.S. could pose a threat to poultry companies such as Tyson, Perdue Farms Inc., Sanderson Farms Inc. and Pilgrim's Pride Corp. Meat companies are already raising prices as they cite worker shortages that have left them unable to meet customer demand, as well as higher transportation and feed costs. Tyson is working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus, a spokesman said, and the company doesn't expect the affected farm in Kentucky to affect its overall chicken production levels. Tyson Foods said last week on its quarterly earnings call with analysts that the Arkansas-based company has increased biosecurity protections in its East Coast facilities, taking extra time to clean vehicles that go to farms and reducing the number of trips to farms overall. 'We have very robust biosecurity measures in place across all of our facilities, and that includes testing every flock for avian influenza,' David Bray, group president of poultry for Tyson, said on the call. Multiple bird-flu cases have been reported across North America in recent weeks, prompting poultry companies to take action. Avian influenza has been confirmed in commercial and backyard flocks in three states this year, the USDA said. An outbreak was reported last week in Dubois County, Ind., on a commercial turkey farm. Earlier this month, bird flu was detected in two wild birds in Florida. In January, a separate case was found in a wild bird in Colleton County in South Carolina, according to the USDA. Canada also recently confirmed a bird-flu case in a commercial turkey farm in western Nova Scotia. The U.S. poultry industry has remained largely unaffected by the disease since an outbreak in 2015 led to the deaths of more than 50 million chickens and turkeys. Since then, chicken, turkey and egg processors invested in new biosecurity measures and other precautions to stem the disease's spread Perdue Farms said none of the recent outbreaks have affected its flocks, but the positive cases are concerning, a company spokeswoman said. The Maryland-based company is having all of its flock advisers visit the farmers in their service area to review biosecurity protocols, she said. Shares of Tyson closed down about 3% Monday. Shares of Sanderson Farms and egg giant Cal-Maine Foods Inc. both declined about 1%, while Pilgrim's Pride declined 0.5%. Major stock indexes declined by less than 1%. Any immediate impact on poultry companies' sales is likely to be minimal, because chicken-importing countries may decide to continue purchasing U.S. poultry products from states where bird flu hasn't been detected, said Christine McCracken, executive director of meat research at agricultural lender Rabobank. A bigger impact on exports could come if the virus is reported in major poultry producing states like Arkansas, she said. 'It is being carried by wild birds so there isn't much control over the spread other than traditional biosecurity measures,' Ms. McCracken said. 'It's still early in the season, but it wouldn't be surprising if additional cases are found.' Labor shortages on farms also may increase the risk of spreading the virus, she said. Chicken producers are relying on a smaller number of available workers to clean more farms, and newer workers may not be as efficient at certain hygiene practices, she said.

{"id": "50", "title": "US bird flu case puts chicken, turkey farms on high alert", "date": "2022-02-15", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Farms that raise turkeys and chickens for meat and eggs are on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity, fearing a repeat of a widespread bird flu outbreak in 2015 that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion. The new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana. The 29,000 turkeys in the flock were killed to prevent the spread of the virus. Indiana officials said Tuesday a second flock of 26,473 turkeys near the first infected farm is suspected to have the same virus. Testing is underway to confirm. The second location already is within a quarantine zone established for the first farm. The USDA also has confirmed the presence of bird flu in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and are awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky. A backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also is positive for the virus. State officials quarantined areas and the birds at the new positively identified sites will be killed and removed. The poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they're urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry. Egg, turkey and chicken prices could rise and availability could drop if birds at enough farms were to be infected. It's definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry, said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. I feel positive that we can tackle this situation better and I have my fingers crossed that this will be an isolated case, however, I would hope for the best and be prepared for the worst. Health officials say no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S. and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern. The virus can spread from infected birds to people but such infections are rare and haven't led to sustained outbreaks among humans. The 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer, and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation's leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The disease caused egg and turkey prices across the country to soar for months, with the cost of eggs up 61% at one point and prices for boneless, skinless turkey breasts rising 75% between May and July 2015. The outbreaks were deemed the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history, costing the government nearly $1 billion for removal and disposal of infected birds and government indemnity payments to producers for the lost birds. The strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus. It has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified. Migratory wild birds often carry strains of avian influenza and they're often low pathogenic, which means they don't kill the birds. Sometimes those strains can get into domestic flocks and mutate into more deadly viruses. The H5N1 now spreading from wild birds is already highly pathogenic, which means it is deadly from the start, said Dr. Yuko Sato, a veterinarian and assistant professor in the Department of Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine at Iowa State University. U.S. surveillance efforts have identified the virus in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and South Carolina, making it apparent that it is in the environment broadly. The virus spreads easily from wild bird droppings and can be carried into commercial flocks on the feet of workers or on equipment, which is why high-level biosecurity protocol has been activated across the country in commercial operations. They've enacted new safeguards to prevent deadly bird flu infections, often referred to as HPAI, and isolate them when they occur. With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection, said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA, which deals with outbreaks on U.S. Federal and state officials are working with the poultry industry and have initiated steps such as an immediate quarantine that restricts movement of poultry and equipment used to move birds in and out of specified perimeters around an infected barn — usually around 6 miles (10 kilometers) initially — and eradication of the virus by killing and removing birds at the infection site. Testing occurs in the quarantine area of both wild and domestic birds. Disinfection is done to kill the virus at the affected farm and testing is used to confirm it's free of the virus. Producers who want to ensure eligibility for government indemnity payments in case of disaster must have a biosecurity protocol on hand that is updated regularly. To help with that, the USDA has developed a 14-point biosecurity plan for producers, which is audited yearly and reviewed every two years by state agriculture agencies, Sato said. In Iowa, a state with 49 million chickens, egg farmers are working with state and federal authorities to keep the disease out of their flocks, said Kevin Stiles, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council.

The most recently identified infections occurred at a Tyson Foods commercial broiler in Fulton County, Ky., that has 240,000 chickens, and in a backyard flock of mixed species in Fauquier County, Va. Kentucky officials said they were also waiting for the results of tests on a flock of turkeys in Webster County. The infections come after 29,000 turkeys were destroyed in Indiana once officials detected the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County. Federal officials said the Indiana outbreak was the first confirmed case in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020. The developments raise concerns that avian influenza could affect more poultry operations in the United States, which is the world's top producer of poultry and the No. 2 exporter in volume, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. They also come as the United States is seeing higher than usual inflation rates in necessities such as food. Avian influenza is carried by wild bird populations that spread the virus to domestic birds. Outbreaks involving more virulent strains result in higher mortality rates in domestic birds, potentially causing disruptions to the food supply. The outbreak in Fulton County was found after the operation reported an increase in poultry deaths to Kentucky officials. Avian influenza doesn't pose a public health risk to humans, U.S. agriculture officials said, so long as poultry and eggs are properly cooked at internal temperatures above 165 degrees. No human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the United States, although more than 700 global cases have been reported since 2003, federal officials say. Officials have quarantined the operations in Kentucky and Virginia, the Agriculture Department said, and birds at the locations will not enter the food system. Tyson Foods is heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, Gary Mickelson, a company spokesman, said in an emailed statement. The company tests all flocks for avian influenza before the birds leave the farms, he said. The recent outbreak will not affect Tyson's overall chicken production, because thousands of farms raise the birds for the firm, he added. In a deadly outbreak that occurred between December 2014 and June 2015, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys either died of HPAI or were killed to stop the disease's spread, according to the Agriculture Department. The federal government spent almost $880 million at the time to pay for the destruction of infected poultry, cleaning and indemnities for lost birds. The outbreak also led to a $1.1 billion decrease in exports of broiler chickens in 2015, compared with the prior year.

The new cases were reported last week when nearly 30,000 turkeys at a southern Indiana farm were euthanized after the H5N1 strain of avian flu was detected, the first time it had been seen in the U.S. since 2020. But on Monday and Tuesday, health officials said the same flu strain had been detected in 26,000 turkeys on another Indiana farm, as well as in a mixed flock of birds in Virginia and a flock of broiler chickens at a Tyson Foods farm in Kentucky. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the farms are quarantined and the birds in Virginia have been euthanized. The same will be done to those in Indiana and Kentucky, and another farm in western Kentucky is waiting on lab results. \"The risk is too high of spread to wait until the laboratory confirmation comes in, especially with the presumptive positive and clinical signs in the birds already,\" said Denise Derrer Spears, spokesperson for the Indiana board of animal health. \"So the owners are taking action to prevent further spread.\" There are an estimated 246,000 chickens at the Tysons farm, but it is unclear how many will be euthanized. Tyson Foods said in a statement to USA TODAY that they were working with Tennessee and Kentucky state officials, as well as federal officials, to prevent the spread. \"Tyson Foods is prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing. This includes heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, placing additional restrictions on outside visitors and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms. Tyson Foods' chicken products remain safe: the USDA confirms that avian influenza does not pose a food safety risk to consumers in poultry that is properly prepared and cooked. \"Because the affected farm in Kentucky is only one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for our company, the situation is not expected to impact our overall chicken production levels,\" the statement read. It is unclear how the latest bird flu cases began, but health officials have noted that migratory wild birds are likely spreading the disease. \"At this time, our goal is to continue to monitor the presence of (highly pathogenic avian influenza) in wild bird populations, and to quickly identify any instances where the virus spreads to commercial or backyard birds,\" the USDA said in a statement to USA TODAY. Kevin Stiles, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council, told The Associated Press steps were being taken to prevent the flu from entering the state. The state is the nation's leading egg producer and is home to 49 million chickens. \"IPA is maintaining open communications specifically related to biosecurity best practices and is offering surveillance testing. We are confident in our producers' preparedness and ability to manage their flocks,\" Stiles said. The National Chicken Council added the chicken industry remains on \"high alert,\" but plans are in place to control the spread of the virus. Health officials say no human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the U.S., and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern. The virus can spread from infected birds to people, but such infections are rare and haven't led to sustained outbreaks among humans.

Symptoms of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in birds include sneezing, coughing, walking or swimming in circles, and swelling of the legs and feet, the D.C. nonprofit City Wildlife said in a statement Tuesday. HPAI can also cause sudden death. Found in domestic and wild species, HPAI is highly contagious among birds. Although wild waterfowl are the most common carriers, they are often asymptomatic while birds of prey, such as hawks and owls, and scavengers, such as crows and gulls, may show more severe infection. Though not reported in the District yet, HPAI appears to be drawing closer. The U.S. Agriculture Department reported the disease Feb. 14 among a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Va. The disease is not an immediate public health concern, the USDA said in a statement, and no human cases have been detected. Cassie Shirk, director of legislation and government relations for the Maryland Agriculture Department, said USDA data showed multiple positive tests in wild birds in the Atlantic Flyway, including a duck in Kent County.

{"id": "62", "title": "Avian Flu Spread in the U.S. Worries Poultry Industry", "date": "2022-02-24", "fulltext": "Though the risk to humans is low, scientists warn that outbreaks among farmed birds increase the potential for the virus to mutate and pose a threat to humans. A highly contagious and deadly form of avian influenza has been barreling across the eastern half of the United States in recent weeks, killing both wild birds and farmed poultry and raising fears that an unchecked outbreak could prove calamitous for an industry that was devastated by a similar virus seven years ago. Since early January, when it began killing chickens in northeast Canada, the virus has been identified in migratory waterfowl from Florida to Maine, and has infected backyard chickens in Virginia and New York and sickened thousands of turkeys in Kentucky and Indiana, prompting mass cullings and import bans. On Wednesday, federal officials announced that the virus, a so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza, had been found in a Delaware commercial chicken farm on the Delmarva Peninsula, home to one of the country's largest concentrations of poultry farms. Experts suspect wild birds returning from winter feeding grounds are spreading the virus, most likely through contaminated droppings. With the peak springtime migration still weeks away, many fear the worst is yet to come. 'It's very concerning given how quickly this thing is accelerating,' said Henry Niman, a biochemist in Pittsburgh who studies the genetic evolution of viruses and has been tracking the outbreak's spread across the country. 'I think we could see historic levels of infections.' Federal officials have been urging poultry growers to report sick or dying birds and to tighten their farms' biosecurity measures, which includes preventing contact between wild birds and domestic animals. 'It's important to note that avian influenza is not considered to be a risk to public health and it's not a food-safety risk,' Mike Stepien, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in an email. Although the danger to humans is low, scientists are keeping a close eye on the virus, the Eurasian H5N1, which is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry. That virus does not spread efficiently among humans, but it is extremely deadly, with a fatality rate of 60 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The strain currently spreading across the United States has not jumped to humans, but virologists and epidemiologists say the mounting infections among birds is worrisome because it increases the possibility that the virus could mutate in ways that make it more infectious to people. Dr. Gail Hansen, a public health veterinarian who is the former state epidemiologist for Kansas, noted that influenza viruses have historically been behind the pandemics that affect humans. Some medical historians have traced the deadly influenza pandemic of 1918 to Army recruits in Kansas who may have caught the pathogen from farm animals and then spread it to military camps in Europe. 'Scientists always assumed the next pandemic would be a respiratory influenza,' she said. 'We were wrong with Covid, but it's these kinds of viruses that keep us awake at night.' The virus has also been coursing through Asia, the Middle East and Europe. In recent weeks, 300 outbreaks have been reported in 29 European countries. In Israel, an outbreak at a nature reserve killed thousands of cranes. At the moment turkey farmers, especially those in Indiana and Kentucky, are most worried. Over the past two weeks, several farms in those states have been shuttered after officials discovered the virus among birds that spend their entire lives crammed into massive sheds. Farmers say they have been stunned by how efficiently the virus kills, with animals dying hours after the initial infection. In Indiana, state officials have moved quickly, euthanizing more than 100,000 birds and throwing a six-mile cordon around affected farms — a containment area within which exports are halted and birds are tested daily. 'Everyone is on super-high alert and trying to be as prepared as possible because we all remember the devastation of 2014 and 2015,' said Dr. Denise Heard, a veterinarian with the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. The 2014-15 outbreak is considered the most destructive in the nation's history. It sent poultry and egg prices soaring and cost the industry more than $3 billion — though the federal government compensated farmers for lost flocks. In the end, nearly 50 million birds were killed by the virus or destroyed to prevent its spread, a vast majority of them in Iowa and Minnesota. John Burkel, 54, a fourth-generation turkey grower in northern Minnesota, has been watching the spread with trepidation. In 2015, the virus tore through his farm in a matter of days, leaving just 70 survivors in a shed that had held 7,000 birds. The weeks that followed were spent culling, composting the dead and then repeatedly disinfecting the barns. As a precaution, health officials also advised that he and his son take a course of the antiviral drug Tamiflu. 'We've never seen a virus that virulent,' said Mr. Burkel, a state legislator who works the farm with his wife and two children. 'It was just horrible.' Since then, agriculture officials across the country have pushed farmers to embrace an array of biosecurity measures aimed at preventing outbreaks. They include sealing up tiny holes that might allow mice or sparrows to enter barns, disinfecting the tires of feed-delivery trucks before they enter a farm and creating 'clean' and 'dirty' zones where workers can change into fresh footwear and coveralls before stepping inside an animal containment shed. At the same time, experts say that federal officials have strengthened the nationwide system of surveillance that allows researchers to track, in almost real time, an avian flu's spread within wild bird populations. 'I think the crisis of 2015 made us realize it takes a village to prevent an outbreak and has left us much better prepared,' said Dr. Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian at Iowa State University who advises local farmers about improving their biosecurity practices. But hypervigilance has its limits, especially against a microscopic pathogen that can infiltrate a barn on the leg of a single housefly. For a growing number of scientists, the real threat is the nation's industrialized system of meat and dairy production, with its reliance on genetically identical creatures packed by the thousands inside huge confinement sheds. Nearly all the nine billion chickens raised and slaughtered in the United States each year can trace their lineage to a handful of breeds that have been manipulated to favor fast growth and plump breasts. The birds are also exceptionally vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. 'They all have the same immune system, or lack of an immune system, so once a virus gets inside a barn, it's going to spread like wildfire,' said Dr. Hansen, the public health veterinarian. Andrew deCoriolis, the executive director of Farm Forward, a sustainable agriculture advocacy group, said the lack of genetic diversity isn't just a threat to the nation's food supply; it is also a potential threat to public health. More than half the 22 strains of novel influenza virus that the C.D.C. has identified as 'of special concern' to human health are avian influenza viruses, he said, noting that a 2018 study examining the emergence of 39 highly pathogenic avian viruses found that all but two of them had emerged on industrial poultry farms. He said the sector's emphasis on biosecurity and infection containment obscures a larger, thornier issue that requires a fundamental rethinking of meat and egg production in the United States. 'Instead of asking how factory farms can prevent infections that originate in the environment, which is how they frame it now, we should be asking how they can prevent infections that originate on factory farms,' he said. 'If we keep raising more and more animals in these conditions, we should expect the exact outcome we're getting because that's how the system is set up.'

(AP) — a majority of birds on exhibit at the Detroit Zoo are being moved indoors as a precaution against the bird flu, which federal and state officials have confirmed to be in Michigan. The birds will remain indoors as long as necessary to ensure their health and safety, and many will be out of public view, the Detroit Zoological Society said Friday in a release. Zoo staff can more closely monitor the birds indoors and prevent them from having contact with wild birds that may carry highly pathogenic avian influenza, said Ann Duncan, director of animal health for the zoological society. Flamingos, ostrich, cassowary, sandhill cranes and the zoo-roaming peafowl will be among the birds out of view, as will all birds housed in the Matilda R. Wilson Free-Flight Aviary, the zoological society said. The Polk Penguin Conservation Center will remain open and accessible to the public, because it has separate air handling systems for birds and visitors to the zoo which is located just north of Detroit in Royal Oak. Federal officials said a strain of the virus had been detected in a noncommercial backyard flock of birds in Kalamazoo County in southwestern Michigan. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Thursday that Michigan officials have quarantined the Kalamazoo County site and 34 birds at that property will be depopulated to prevent the spread of disease. It’s not clear how the strain reached the backyard flock, a USDA spokeswoman said. Similar infections have been reported across the United States in recent weeks. The virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry. A 2015 bird flu outbreak killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in the flock of fewer than 50 birds in Pottawattamie County. State officials quarantined the affected location and the birds were killed and incinerated to prevent the spread of the disease. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said since it was a small noncommercial flock there would be no resulting trade or supply chain issues. “The virus does appear to be very prevalent in wild birds so the next few months during the northern migration in the Mississippi flyway will be a time of high alert for all poultry owners,” he said. Cases have been discovered in flocks across the nation in the past month. The first infection was identified in a commercial flock of turkeys in Indiana on Feb. 9. Since then, five more flocks have been found with cases in Indiana, where more than 171,000 birds have been killed and removed. The virus also was detected in flocks of turkeys and broiler chickens in Kentucky last month, resulting in the destruction and disposal of more than 284,000 birds. A commercial chicken flock in Delaware also was infected, leading to the disposal of 1.2 million birds, the USDA said. A noncommercial backyard case also was identified Wednesday in Connecticut. Similar cases have been found in backyard flocks in recent days in Michigan, Maine, New York and Virginia. The discovery of avian influenza is especially troubling in Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer. In 2015, an outbreak led producers to kill 33 million hens in the state and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation’s leading turkey producer.

Iowa agriculture officials and the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the case in Buena Vista County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the case identified March 1 in a backyard flock of 42 ducks and chickens in Pottawattamie County. Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a disaster proclamation for Buena Vista County to allow state resources to help with disposal of the affected flock and disinfection of the farm. Officials didn't immediately disclose the number of birds involved. The emergency declaration also provides resources for tracking, monitoring and the rapid detection of bird flu. The turkeys have been killed and disposed of on the farm. A 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) control area has been established to limit traffic in and out of the area while extensive testing is done to ensure no other cases, said State Veterinarian Dr. Jeff Kaisand. He said five other commercial farms are within the zone and 37 backyard flocks. The discovery of avian influenza is especially troubling in Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer. In 2015, an outbreak led producers to kill 33 million hens in the state and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation's leading turkey producer.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said in a statement that state and federal agriculture officials are working with producers to trace back, control and eradicate this disease from our state. Naig told reporters that if the virus spreads significantly into commercial egg, chicken or turkey populations, then consumer prices and product availability could become an issue. Cases have been reported in at least 12 states in backyard flocks and commercial production houses. We're not seeing a massive outbreak on a large scale and so I think it's too soon to be concerned about food impact or pricing impact at this point, but you have to acknowledge that can be an issue over time, he said.

Increasing levels of exposure will be harmful for animal health and reduce meat and dairy production in many parts of the world, according to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of the world's leading climate scientists. The world's first octopus farm looks set to open in the Canary Islands as government officials carry out an environmental assessment on plans for a facility starting in 2023. Animal rights activists have protested against the plans, with octopuses known to be intelligent and inquisitive as seen in the Netflix film My Octopus Teacher. One egg a day for everyone on the planet is the aim of an initiative to double global egg consumption over the next decade. Mexico and Japan lead the way at present with a per capita consumption of more than 300 eggs a year. Almost all of Japan's egg producers use battery cages as it continues to resist international pressure to improve welfare conditions for chickens. Europe's largest egg producer, France, has banned the slaughter of male chicks. The industry has until the end of 2022 to comply. Farmers will be required to look at alternative methods to ensure male chicks are not born, including the use of technology that enables the sex of the embryo to be identified before they develop into chicks and hatch. France is also trialling avian influenza vaccines as countries across Europe battle one of the worst winters for the disease on the continent. Any vaccine is complicated by the numerous strains of bird flu and the bans some countries have on importing poultry meat from countries that vaccinate birds. An outbreak of a deadly pig disease African swine fever was covered up by officials in Thailand, it has been claimed. The government denies the accusation and said most pig deaths were from another deadly disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. Meanwhile, the World Bank is funding a project to scale-up intensive pig farming in Vietnam. A provision to ban commercial mink farms in the US has been added to a bill making its way through Congress. Most countries in the EU have now banned fur farming, with the UK the first country to do so in 2000. China is on its way to becoming the world's biggest producer. UK news Farmed fish should have the same legal protection as other farmed animals, say animal welfare activists. The Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, which has the prime minister's wife Carrie Johnson as a patron, says fish deserve to be treated with the same care as cows, pigs, sheep and other livestock because they experience stress and pain. Herefordshire county council is asking residents if their health and wellbeing has been affected by intensive chicken farms. Of the 1.1 billion broiler chickens slaughtered each year in Britain, about 25% are raised in Herefordshire and Shropshire. A surge in poultry farms means there are 70 times more chickens than people in the two counties. Vets have described undercover footage showing cows from a Welsh dairy farm being kicked, hit with shovels and mistreated as 'abuse' and 'totally unnecessary.' The farm was stripped of its membership of the red tractor assurance scheme, which admitted that some welfare breaches are not always detectable during its inspections. The UK may no longer move ahead with a ban on the import and sale of fur and foie gras, according to reports. The ban had been proposed in the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto. British farmers have been banned from making foie gras 'created by force-feeding ducks or geese' since 2000. The use of critically important antibiotics on UK dairy farms fell by 98% between 2018 and 2021, according to an industry study. The vast majority of farm antibiotics in the UK are used in the pig and poultry sectors, both of which have reported significant reductions in recent years.

US president Joe Biden's pledge during Cop26 to reduce methane emissions by almost one-third has not, apparently, resulted in any limits on one of the country's biggest emitters: the beef sector. Industry figures admitted they had escaped 'relatively unscathed' but observers warned the US would never meet Biden's 2030 climate reduction goals without regulation. There have been renewed calls in the US to ban 'cruel' on-farm killing methods as the country braces itself for an increase in bird flu outbreaks. Using firefighting foam to suffocate animals and ventilation shutdown, in which animals are killed with extremely high heat and steam, are still permitted in the US, despite being labelled 'inhumane.'

The latest outbreak in Taylor County is the first case of avian influenza in Iowa this year in an egg-laying facility. The previous Iowa cases were a small outbreak among an outdoor flock of ducks and chickens in western Iowa on March 1 and in a flock of 50,000 turkeys in northwest Iowa on March 6. The presence of the virus is especially troubling for poultry producers in Iowa, the nation’s leading egg producer. In 2015, an outbreak led producers to kill 33 million hens in the state and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation’s leading turkey producer. Smaller outbreaks were reported in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The first infection in the U.S. this year was identified in a commercial flock of turkeys in Indiana on Feb. 9. Since then, five additional flocks have been found with cases in Indiana. The virus has now infected backyard and commercial flocks in 12 states and it has been detected in migrating wild birds in about 20 states.

{"id": "85", "title": "The end of free-range eggs? Year-round bird flu outbreaks may keep hens inside", "date": "2022-03-25", "fulltext": "Highly virulent variants of avian flu now appear endemic in wild birds, making farms prone to outbreaks all year, experts warn. Free-range chickens and eggs may no longer be feasible to produce in the UK and elsewhere in Europe in future due to a dramatic escalation in avian flu outbreaks, say leading disease experts. The UK and continental Europe have been hit by the largest outbreak of avian flu on record this winter, with millions of birds culled on farms across the continent. Experts say highly pathogenic variants of avian flu now appear to be endemic in wild birds, creating a risk of infection all year. In the UK, farmers have been ordered to keep their birds indoors since last November and as of this week have been prevented from selling their eggs as free range. The latest reported outbreak, at a farm in Suffolk last weekend, led to more than 80,000 ducks being culled after confirmation of a highly pathogenic variant of avian flu. 'There is a serious problem for free-range and outdoor farms,' said Dr Guillaume Fournié, a veterinarian and epidemiologist at the Royal Veterinary College. 'We are seeing outbreaks on large [indoor] poultry farms that would have had high biosecurity. This suggests that with high environmental exposure to the virus, now it's hard to ensure a farm is 100% biosecure.' Marion Koopmans, a virologist and adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO), said the situation was 'horrible' for the free-range poultry industry. 'The ecology [of avian flu] has changed drastically in just a few years. We now have local circulation all year round in Europe, it's not just a seasonal threat. It has a permanent presence in the wild bird population.' Highly pathogenic avian flu is already endemic in a number of countries in Asia, with infection of poultry reported all-year round. 'The question [in the UK/Europe] is whether sedentary (non-migratory) wild birds will maintain the virus circulation over the summer. This would mean a constant pressure of infection on poultry farms, which would then increase seasonally with migratory birds,' said Fournié. Koopmans, who took part in the WHO's Covid mission to China in 2021, said higher levels of biosecurity, vaccination of chickens and reductions in intensive poultry farms in parts of Europe may all be needed to prevent outbreaks. Measures to ensure biosecurity and prevent infection reaching hens include cleaning and disinfecting, safe storage of feed and water and quarantining new stock. France, which has experienced close to 1,000 avian flu outbreaks this winter, has been trialling avian influenza vaccines, but the solution has been complicated by the numerous variants of avian flu. The market for free-range eggs has grown rapidly in the UK over the past decade. Last year, almost two-thirds of 11 billion eggs produced in the UK last year were free-range, up from 27% in 2004. The Co-op, Sainsbury's, M&S, Morrisons and Waitrose no longer stock eggs that are not free-range. Some have suggested introducing covered outdoor areas or changing the rules for free-range egg producers to allow for longer periods spent indoors. However, it is unclear how consumers would react to this shift. 'The whole point of free-range is they have the opportunity to roam outside,' said Andrew Knight, a veterinary professor at the University of Winchester. Radically changing the rules for free-range eggs would be wrong, said Dan Crossley, from the Food Ethics Council. 'I think most people have a reasonable understanding of what free-range is, so what we want to avoid is muddying the water and any confusion around what different terms mean.' UK government officials have said there are no plans to review the existing legislation, which provided producers with a 16-week 'derogation' during which the free-range description can be kept on eggs even though the hens have been confined. Mark Williams, chief executive of the British Egg Industry Council, said he was confident that hens would be allowed outside again soon. 'The greatest risk comes when the migratory birds are carrying it around, which is why we have these outbreaks at the same time every year between Autumn and Spring,' he said. The UK Health Security Agency said there was year-round avian flu surveillance of dead wild birds. 'Despite recording a record number of outbreaks this season, the risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low,' said a spokesperson.

This week an outbreak was confirmed at a commercial flock in Nebraska, causing 570,000 broiler chickens to be destroyed. In Delaware and Maryland, more than two million birds at commercial poultry flocks have been affected. In South Dakota, an outbreak last week led to the killing of 85,000 birds. An outbreak confirmed March 14 at a commercial operation in Wisconsin meant more than 2.7 million egg-laying chickens were killed. The latest data from the USDA show 59 confirmed sites of avian flu across commercial and backyard flocks in 17 states since the start of the year. That figure includes chickens, turkey and other poultry. The USDA identified a case of avian flu in a wild bird in mid-January, the first detection of the virus in wild birds in the U.S. since 2016. Wild birds can spread the virus to commercial and backyard flocks. By Feb. 9, the virus had been identified in a commercial flock in Indiana. There have since been hundreds of confirmed cases of wild birds infected with avian flu. The last major avian flu outbreak in the U.S. was from December 2014 to June 2015, when more than 50 million chickens and turkeys either died from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or were destroyed to stop its spread. During that outbreak, chicken breast prices increased 17%, according to agriculture data company Gro Intelligence. But at the same time, prices for cuts of chicken geared toward the export market actually dropped due to bans on importing U.S. poultry in countries including China, South Korea, Cuba and Mexico. So the cost of leg quarters, for instance, dropped 18%, according to the data. Poultry prices—especially for eggs and turkey—were affected for years, the company reports. The impact on prices this time depends on how widespread the flu becomes. Whether the 2022 avian flu will affect the price of eggs and poultry depends on how widespread it becomes, says Ron Kean, a poultry science expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences. \"In 2015, we did see quite an increase in egg prices,\" Kean told Wisconsin Public Radio. \"The chicken meat wasn't severely affected at that time. We did see quite a loss in turkeys, so turkey prices went up. So, we'll see. If a lot of farms contract this, then we could see some real increases in price.\" What's the risk to humans from this bird flu? Not much so far, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the CDC's most recent update on March 7, the H5N1 bird flu poses a low risk to the public, and is currently \"primarily an animal health issue.\" The CDC notes that some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection. You can't get avian flu from eating poultry or eating eggs that are properly prepared and cooked, the USDA explains. The chance of infected poultry entering the food chain is extremely low, the agency says, because of its food inspection program and avian flu response plan. \"All poultry products for public consumption are inspected for signs of disease both before and after slaughter,\" the USDA notes, and avian flu causes a rapid onset of symptoms in poultry. For producers who suspect their flock may be affected by avian flu, the USDA has a guide to the warning signs, including a sudden increase in bird deaths, lack of energy and appetite, and a decrease in egg production.

{"id": "92", "title": "Iowa to kill 1.5M more hens and turkeys because of bird flu", "date": "2022-03-29", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Iowa agriculture officials announced two more bird flu outbreaks in commercial flocks on Tuesday that will require the killing of more than 1.5 million hens and turkeys. One of the new outbreaks will lead to the killing of 1.5 million chickens at an egg-laying farm in Guthrie County, about 60 miles west of Des Moines. The other was at a turkey farm in Hamilton County, about 65 miles north of Des Moines, where 28,000 birds will be killed. After they are killed, birds typically are buried in compost pits on the farms. Iowa State Veterinarian Dr. Jeff Kaisand said it appears the infections are coming from migrating wild birds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says 17 states have had outbreaks in commercial or private outdoor flocks this year. The virus has been found in wild birds in at least 25 states. With the addition of the new Iowa cases, the U.S. poultry industry has had to kill more than 15.6 million chickens and 1.3 million turkeys since Jan. 1. In Iowa alone, infections have been found in seven commercial flocks and two backyard flocks. Iowa's agriculture secretary, Mike Naig, said the situation could worsen since the spring migration is likely to continue for a few more months. Much depends on the weather and improved biosecurity on farms, he said. Naig said it's too soon to estimate the economic loss this year. 'It's a difficult time for poultry producers, not just those that have an infected site,' he said. Food prices are already high due to inflation and supply chain problems, and if the bird flu outbreak expands to enough farms, chicken, turkey and egg prices could climb higher. Health officials say they don't know of any people who have caught the bird flu in the U.S., and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern. The virus can spread from infected birds to people, but such infections are rare and haven't led to sustained outbreaks among humans. The worst recent bird flu outbreak in the U.S. happened in 2015, when more than 230 farms in 15 states had outbreaks leading to the killing of over 50 million birds. The total economic loss has been valued at $3.3 billion, according to research published in 2019 by a group of Iowa State University scientists. In 2015, cases didn't surface in Iowa until mid-April. This year the first Iowa case was confirmed on March 1. Eds: UPDATES: Updates story with more detail and comments.

Massachusetts Wyoming North Carolina Ohio North Dakota Minnesota New Hampshire Nebraska Wisconsin Connecticut Iowa Missouri South Dakota Maryland Kansas Illinois Michigan Delaware Maine New York Virginia Indiana South Carolina According to the USDA, avian influenza, or 'bird flu,' is a respiratory disease of birds caused by influenza A viruses and can kill domestic poultry. It spreads rapidly through contact between the birds or contaminated material. The main reason for depopulating commercial poultry or turkeys is to try and contain the spread because it can spread quite easily, Tara Harrison, with North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine, told WRAL.

{"id": "97", "title": "Egg Prices Jump as Bird Flu Hits Poultry Flocks; Avian influenza spreading across the U.S. has led to the deaths of more than 17 million birds, tightening supplies for eggs and poultry", "date": "2022-04-02", "fulltext": "A rapidly escalating bird-flu outbreak in the U.S. is contributing to a surge in egg prices and threatens to raise prices on other poultry products in the coming months as deaths continue to mount. Cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza so far have led to the deaths of more than 17 million birds, according to Agriculture Department data. The virus outbreak, the worst in seven years, is hitting Midwest egg-laying flocks and affecting companies from Tyson Foods Inc. to Hormel Foods Corp. More than 11 million egg-laying chickens, roughly 3% of the total U.S. flock, have died or been destroyed as a result of the disease, along with more than two million commercially raised turkeys. Shell egg prices have climbed to $2.88 a dozen, up about 52% since Feb. 8, when the USDA confirmed the first case in a U.S. commercial turkey flock in Indiana. It is their highest point since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, according to market research firm Urner Barry. Prices are being driven higher by the disease's spread and the coming Easter holiday, when demand for eggs is high, analysts said. Industry officials aren't expecting any shortages, but analysts said retailers are buying up eggs in anticipation that supplies could tighten in the coming weeks. \"Egg availability heading into Easter is sure to be hampered,\" said Brian Earnest, an animal protein economist at CoBank. The U.S. supply of table egg-laying chickens is down from more than 340 million in April 2019 to about 322 million in February, he estimated. As a result, companies like Cal-Maine Inc., the largest U.S. egg producer by sales, are poised to see higher egg prices for the rest of the year as a result of the tighter market, said analysts at Stephens Inc. Cal-Maine said Wednesday that it hasn't had any cases at company-owned or contracted production facilities to date. \"We are also working closely with egg industry associations and government officials to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks and effectively manage our response,\" said Dolph Baker, Cal-Maine's chief executive. The price of turkey breasts, already at its highest levels since the last major avian influenza outbreak in 2015, has held around $4.45 a pound over the past few weeks, according to Urner Barry. With turkey supplies already tight and demand likely to grow in the summer months, further flock losses could push prices higher, said Russ Whitman, senior vice president at the firm. Dozens of bird-flu cases have been reported across the U.S. in the past two months, with cases ranging from Maryland to South Dakota. The disease was confirmed by the USDA in five new U.S. states Wednesday. The disease also was confirmed in several commercial turkey farms in Minnesota that supply Hormel's Jennie-O Turkey Store brand, affecting more than 300,000 turkeys, the company said. Perdue Farms Inc. said it received confirmation in late February of bird flu in two of its Indiana turkey flocks. Tyson said there was an outbreak in a flock of about 240,000 birds at a commercial farm in Fulton County, Ky., that housed the company's chickens. The bird-flu outbreak comes as food prices are already on the rise, with food makers paying more for fuel, ingredients and labor. Analysts said it can be difficult to pinpoint how much prices of certain protein products have been affected by the bird flu because of other inflationary pressures. The war between two grain-producing powers, Russia and Ukraine, is further inflating meat prices as producers rely heavily on grain to feed livestock and poultry. The U.S. poultry industry had remained largely unaffected by avian influenza since the 2015 outbreak that led to the deaths of more than 50 million chickens and turkeys, the largest ever recorded in the U.S. Since then, chicken, turkey and egg processors invested in new biosecurity measures and other precautions. Officials said the increased measures give them confidence they can mitigate the spread, but this year's outbreak has been hard to predict. The USDA has been working with the poultry industry and individual states on surveillance and communicating proper farm safety measures since then, said Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer at the USDA. The department said it compensates farm owners for fair market value of any animals euthanized and other costs associated with controlling the virus. Safety measures include not sharing equipment between farms and keeping it disinfected, and workers showering and donning clean clothing and boots before interacting with a flock, she said. Farmers also need to secure their barns from wild birds that could be carrying the virus: A breakthrough at a commercial farm could be as simple as a worker stepping on wild bird fecal matter outside of the barn and forgetting to clean their boots before entering, experts said. Trey Braswell, a fourth-generation farmer in Nashville, N.C., said he has limited visitors to his farm, disinfects all vehicles and requires any outside vehicles coming in to go through a carwash. His 1.7 million layer chickens haven't been affected so far. \"There is no foolproof system,\" he said. \"Egg farmers are working around the clock.\" Farmers, industry groups and the USDA have held weekly calls about managing the bird flu's impact, said Emily Metz, CEO of the American Egg Board, which represents egg producers. Shortages are still a long way off, she said. Egg producers have in some cases shifted orders around to avoid missed deliveries to customers, she said. \"If one producer is affected in a certain region, they are calling around neighbors to see if they can make sure the order is met,\" she said.

(AP) — A strain of avian flu has made its way to Wyoming, and poultry producers of all sizes are being warned to keep a close eye on their flocks. As of Thursday, the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, had been confirmed in two Wyoming counties. HPAI is a highly contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys and other birds, and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death in infected birds,” the Wyoming Livestock Board said in recent news releases. The virus was identified in birds from Johnson County, the state Livestock Board said Wednesday, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS. On Thursday, the Livestock Board said the virus had also been identified in Park County birds. Recent HPAI detections don’t present an immediate public health concern, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and no human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S., the news releases said. Both samples were from birds the news release said had been part of a non-commercial backyard mixed-species flock (non-poultry). They were initially tested by the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and were confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa. The Livestock Board said its officials had quarantined the areas where both flocks lived, and that the birds would be destroyed to prevent further spread. It also said it was working closely with USDA APHIS on a joint incident response, including additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The Livestock Board offered assurances that birds and eggs from the infected flocks would not enter the food system. Still, it issued a reminder that all poultry and eggs should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit as a general food safety precaution. More information can be found on the APHIS website. For more information specific to Wyoming, contact the Livestock Board at 307-777-7515, or visit its website at wlsb.state.wy.us/public. Following Thursday’s news release, the Livestock Board said, information about any additional confirmed cases would be shared directly with local communities and announced on its website. Prevention and monitoring Wyoming State Veterinarian Dr. Hallie Hasel told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle on Thursday that the avian flu hasn’t been seen in the state for several years. However, the U.S. has seen rapid spread in 2022, and it’s very difficult to predict when the virus might show up and how prevalent it may be, Hasel said. Anyone involved in poultry production, from the small backyard chicken owner to the large commercial producer, should review their biosecurity activities, or measures taken to prevent disease, the state Livestock Board said. Because avian flu is spread by migratory birds, the best way to prevent its spread is to keep poultry in a chicken coop or other structure away from wild birds, as well as from standing water, Hasel said. An ordinance allowing the keeping of backyard chickens within the city limits was passed by the Cheyenne City Council in April 2016. It is unclear how common the practice is currently. Hasel said that, because of the risk of spread between flocks, those who keep poultry should not visit other places where these birds are kept until the virus has stopped spreading. That will happen over the next couple months as we progress from spring into summer, Hasel said. The migration, of course, slows down, and so the spread of the virus will decrease significantly as the migratory birds have reached their destination. Birds should be monitored for symptoms of HPAI, including: coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite; decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; lack of coordination; and diarrhea. Even if birds aren’t showing symptoms, avian flu can cause sudden death, the Livestock Board said. Anyone who sees these symptoms should immediately contact their veterinarian. Those without a regular vet should call the Livestock Board at 307-777-8270 or 307-777-6440.

{"id": "99", "title": "What to Know About the Bird Flu Outbreak", "date": "2022-04-02", "fulltext": "A highly pathogenic form of the avian flu has been detected in 29 states. Millions of chickens and turkeys from infected commercial and backyard flocks have been killed. From Wyoming to Maine, an outbreak of the highly contagious bird flu has swept across farms and backyard flocks in the United States this year, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled. Iowa has been particularly hard hit, with disasters being declared in some counties and the state canceling live bird exhibits in an order that may affect its famed state fair. Here is what we know about the bird flu. What is avian influenza? Better known as the bird flu, avian influenza is a highly contagious and deadly virus that can prey on chickens, turkeys and wild birds, including ducks, geese and eagles. It spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it difficult to contain. Symptoms of the virus include a sudden increase in the mortality of a flock, a drop in egg production and diminished consumption of feed and water. The virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry. Its prevalence in the United States is not unexpected, with outbreaks previously reported in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Should humans be worried about being infected? The risk to humans is very low, said Ron Kean, a faculty associate and extension specialist in the University of Wisconsin at Madison department of animal and dairy sciences. 'It's not impossible for humans to get this virus, but it's been pretty rare,' Professor Kean said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had been monitoring people in the United States who were exposed to infected poultry and other birds. So far, no cases of H5N1 infection have been found among them, the C.D.C. said. Is it safe to eat poultry and eggs? Yes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has said that properly prepared and cooked poultry and eggs should not pose a risk to consumers. The chance of infected poultry entering the food chain is 'extremely low,' the agency has said. Under federal guidelines, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, part of the U.S.D.A., is responsible for inspecting all poultry sold in interstate and foreign commerce. Inspectors are required to be present at all times during the slaughtering process, according to the service, which noted that the inspectors have unfettered access to those facilities. Egg-production facilities that are subject to federal regulation are required to undergo daily inspections once per shift, according to the inspection service. State inspection programs, which inspect poultry products sold only within the state they were produced, are additionally monitored by the U.S.D.A. Because of the mandated culling of infected flocks, experts say, the virus is primarily an animal health issue at this time. Still, the U.S.D.A. recommends cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit to reduce the potential for food-borne illness. Can I expect to pay more for poultry products? Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015. Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'at record high levels,' according to an April 22 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A. If infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs. Prices for white and dark chicken meat were also rising, according to the U.S.D.A. Experts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile. How is the virus detected? Testing for the avian flu typically involves swabbing the mouths and tracheal area of chickens and turkeys. The samples are sent to diagnostic labs to be analyzed. Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states. As of April 20, the highly pathogenic form of the avian flu had been detected in 29 states, a tracking page maintained by the U.S.D.A. showed. The combined number of birds in the infected flocks — the commercial and backyard type — totaled more than 33 million, according to the agency. A spokesman for the U.S.D.A. confirmed that those birds would be required to be euthanized to prevent the spread of the virus. Two commercial egg production facilities in Iowa, one in Buena Vista County and another in Osceola County, constituted the largest infected flocks. Each was made up of more than 5 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said. A producer of eggs in Jefferson County, Wis., was the third-largest infected flock, with more than 2.7 million chickens. The outbreak has taken an unusual toll on raptors or birds of prey, including more than three dozen bald eagles. Because spring is nesting season, some experts are worried that avian flu may pose a serious threat to the birds' potential offspring. In April, two cases of bird flu were confirmed in zoos in the United States, the Agriculture Department told The Associated Press, though a spokesman declined to give details or identify the zoos. Officials said they would not order the widespread euthanasia of zoo birds as they have on farms. Zoos in the United States began moving birds indoors, away from people and wildlife, to protect them from the bird flu. How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones? The outbreak in 2014 and 2015 in the United States was blamed for $3 billion in losses to the agricultural sector and was considered to be the most destructive in the nation's history. Nearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota. The footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns. 'I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. What can be done to stop the spread of the virus? As early as last year, the U.S.D.A. warned of the likelihood of an outbreak of the avian flu and emphasized a hardening of 'biosecurity' measures to protect flocks of chickens and turkeys. Biosecurity measures include limiting access to the flocks and requiring farm workers to practice strict hygiene measures like wearing disposable boots and coveralls. Sharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus. So can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting. 'Whether that's limiting access where we source feed and water, even truck routes, how do we try to limit those connections that might spread pathogens between flocks are all really important,' Dr. Bowman said. 'At this point, every person producing poultry has to be considering how to improve their biosecurity.' Experts at the University of Minnesota have also recommended that people stop using outdoor bird feeders and bird baths for a few months, until the rate of transmission decreases, to discourage birds from gathering. 'Not only will this action help to protect those beautiful feathered creatures that visit your yard, but will also help all wild bird species that are already having it hard this spring because of the outbreak,' Dr. Victoria Hall, executive director of the Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota, said in a statement. Hummingbird feeders, which present a much lower risk, may be used but should be cleaned daily, the Raptor Center said. Is it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys? Infected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A. The virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks. Methods include spraying chickens and turkeys with a foam that causes asphyxiation. In other cases, carbon dioxide is used to kill the birds, whose carcasses are often composted or placed in a landfill. 'It's arguably more humane than letting them die from the virus,' Professor Kean said. Isabella Grullón Paz contributed reporting.

The new cases mean that across the nation, farmers have had to kill about 22 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens but also including 1.8 million broiler chickens, 1.9 million pullet and other commercial chickens, and 1.9 million turkeys. Iowa accounts for many of those cases, with operations having to kill about 13 million chickens and 305,000 turkeys since the outbreaks began a month ago. Iowa is the nation’s leading egg producer and had 46 million chickens on farms in February, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Iowa raises about 11.7 million turkeys annually. The latest cases were at an egg farm in Osceola County and a turkey farm in Cherokee County, both in northwest Iowa. Earlier this week, state officials also confirmed the virus on a turkey farm with 35,500 birds in Buena Vista County. Because the virus is so infectious and deadly for commercial poultry, entire flocks are destroyed and composted on the farms when they are infected. USDA data shows 23 states have confirmed cases in commercial or backyard flocks. Spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings or nasal discharge of infected wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which can contaminate dust and soil. Infected wild birds have been found in at least 26 states, and the virus has been circulating in migrating waterfowl in Europe and Asia for nearly a year.

(AP) — The bird flu is spreading to additional poultry flocks in Minnesota, according to the state Board of Animal Health. The latest outbreak of avian influenza has now affected 15 flocks in the state, up from seven last Friday. The newly reported cases all are in commercial turkey flocks — two in Kandiyohi County and one each in Becker, Dodge, Le Sueur and Stearns counties, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Previously, the bird flu was found in commercial flocks in Kandiyohi, Lac qui Parle, Meeker, Morrison and Stearns counties, as well as backyard flocks in Mower and Stearns counties. The affected flocks so far include more than 636,000 birds. Birds in affected flocks are euthanized as part of efforts to keep the virus from spreading. The outbreak is a serious threat to Minnesota’s turkey industry, with nearly 700 farms that raise about 40 million birds a year. In 2015, 9 million birds in Minnesota were killed by the virus or euthanized to slow its spread.

Eggs are also a symbol for the Jewish holiday Passover and a fixture on families' Seder plates. Why did egg prices go up? Egg prices typically see a spike in late March to early April depending on when Easter falls as demand increases. Often, the holiday is when retailers discount eggs. But the average weekly price for large eggs is 44% higher than this time last year, according to USDA data. Eggs prices were up 11.4% in February from a year earlier and were up 2.2% from January, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data published in March. The wholesale cost for a carton of eggs in the Midwest jumped 60% from March 25 to April 1 to $2.47. That's still below the peak price in late March 2020, when pandemic and Easter demand collided and caused wholesale egg prices to more than triple to an all-time high of $3.07 a dozen. By far the hardest-hit state has been Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer and home to 46 million chickens on farms as of February, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

According to USDA outbreak tracking, more than 13 million hens have been killed in Iowa in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. Nationwide, the outbreak has affected nearly 18 million commercial table egg layer hens and nearly 2 million turkeys. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the risk to the general public's health is low. \"So far, current H5N1 bird flu viruses lack changes seen in the past that have been associated with viruses spreading easily among poultry, infecting people more easily, and causing severe illness in people,\" the CDC said in a March update about the outbreak. Only one human case of the H5N1 virus has been reported. It was found in January in a person in the United Kingdom who did not have any symptoms and who raised birds that became infected. No human infections have been identified in the U.S. The CDC and USDA said poultry and eggs that are properly prepared and cooked are safe to eat. \"The proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165F kills bacteria and viruses, including H5N1 bird flu viruses,\" according to the CDC.

{"id": "105", "title": "Zoos hiding birds as avian flu spreads in North America", "date": "2022-04-06", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Zoos across North America are moving their birds indoors and away from people and wildlife as they try to protect them from the highly contagious and potentially deadly avian influenza. Penguins may be the only birds visitors to many zoos can see right now, because they already are kept inside and usually protected behind glass in their exhibits, making it harder for the bird flu to reach them. Nearly 23 million chickens and turkeys have already been killed across the United States to limit the spread of the virus, and zoos are working hard to prevent any of their birds from meeting the same fate. It would be especially upsetting for zoos to have to kill any of the endangered or threatened species in their care. 'It would be extremely devastating,' said Maria Franke, who is the manager of welfare science at Toronto Zoo, which has less than two dozen Loggerhead Shrike songbirds that it's breeding with the hope of reintroducing them into the wild. 'We take amazing care and the welfare and well being of our animals is of the utmost importance. There's a lot of staff that has close connections with the animals that they care for here at the zoo.' Toronto Zoo workers are adding roofs to some outdoor bird exhibits and double-checking the mesh surrounding enclosures to ensure it will keep wild birds out. Birds shed the virus through their droppings and nasal discharge. Experts say it can be spread through contaminated equipment, clothing, boots and vehicles carrying supplies. Research has shown that small birds that squeeze into zoo exhibits or buildings can also spread the flu, and that mice can even track it inside. So far, no outbreaks have been reported at zoos, but there have been wild birds found dead that had the flu. For example, a wild duck that died in a behind-the-scenes area of the Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines, Iowa, after tornadoes last month tested positive, zoo spokesman Ryan Bickel said. Most of the steps zoos are taking are designed to prevent contact between wild birds and zoo animals. In some places, officials are requiring employees to change into clean boots and don protective gear before entering bird areas. When bird flu cases are found in poultry, officials order the entire flock to be killed because the virus is so contagious. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has indicated that zoos might be able to avoid that by isolating infected birds and possibly euthanizing a small number of them. Sarah Woodhouse, director of animal health at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, said she is optimistic after talking with state and federal regulators. 'They all agree that ordering us to depopulate a large part of our collection would be the absolute last-ditch effort. So they're really interested in working with us to see what we can do to make sure that we're not going to spread the disease while also being able to take care of our birds and not have to euthanize,' Woodhouse said. Among the precautions zoos are taking is to keep birds in smaller groups so that if a case is found, only a few would be affected. The USDA and state veterinarians would make the final decision about which birds had to be killed. 'Euthanasia is really the only way to keep it from spreading,' said Luis Padilla, who is vice president of animal collections at the Saint Louis Zoo. 'That's why we have so many of these very proactive measures in place.' The National Aviary in Pittsburgh — the nation's largest — is providing individual health checks for each of its roughly 500 birds. Many already live in large glass enclosures or outdoor habitats where they don't have direct exposure to wildlife, said Dr. Pilar Fish, the aviary's senior director of veterinary medicine and zoological advancement. Kansas City Zoo CEO Sean Putney said he's heard a few complaints from visitors, but most people seem OK with not getting to see some birds. 'I think our guests understand that we have what's in the best interests of the animals in mind when we make these decisions even though they can't get to see them,' Putney said. Officials emphasize that bird flu doesn't jeopardize the safety of meat or eggs or represent a significant risk to human health. No infected birds are allowed into the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs kills bacteria and viruses. No human cases have been found in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ___ Associated Press Writers David Pitt contributed to this report from Des Moines, Iowa, Lindsay Whitehurst contributed from Salt Lake City, Julie Watson contributed from San Diego, Chris Grygiel contributed from Seattle and Tom Tait contributed from Las Vegas.

{"id": "108", "title": "Bird flu's grisly question: how to kill millions of poultry", "date": "2022-04-07", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The spread of a bird flu that is deadly to poultry raises the grisly question of how farms manage to quickly kill and dispose of millions of chickens and turkeys. It's a chore that farms across the country are increasingly facing as the number of poultry killed in the past two months has climbed to more than 24 million, with outbreaks reported nearly every day. Some farms have had to kill more than 5 million chickens at a single site with a goal of destroying the birds within 24 hours to limit the spread of the disease and prevent animals from suffering. 'The faster we can get on site and depopulate the birds that remain on site, the better,' Minnesota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said. The outbreak is the biggest since 2015, when producers had to kill more than 50 million birds. So far this year, there have been cases in 24 states, with Iowa the hardest hit with about 13 million chickens and turkeys killed. Other states with sizable outbreaks include Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota and Indiana. Farms faced with the need to kill so many birds turn to recommendations by the American Veterinary Medical Association. Even as it has developed methods to kill the poultry quickly, the association acknowledges its techniques 'may not guarantee that the deaths the animals face are painless and distress free.' Veterinarians and U.S. Department of Agriculture officials also typically oversee the process. One of the preferred methods is to spray water-based firefighting foam over birds as they roam around the ground inside a barn. That foam kills the animals by cutting off their air supply. When foam won't work because birds are in cages above the ground or it's too cold, the USDA recommends sealing up barns and piping carbon dioxide inside, first rendering the birds unconscious and ultimately killing them. If one those methods won't work because equipment or workers aren't available, or when the size of a flock is too large, the association said a last resort is a technique called ventilation shutdown. In that scenario, farmers stop airflow into barns, which raises temperatures to levels at which the animals die. The USDA and the veterinary association recommend that farmers add additional heat or carbon dioxide to barns to speed up the process and limit suffering by the animals. Mike Stepien, a spokesman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said the techniques are the best options when it's necessary to quickly kill so many birds. 'State animal health officials and producers carefully weigh the different options to determine the best option for humane depopulation and do not make such decisions lightly,' Stepien said. Not everyone agrees. Animal welfare groups argue that all these methods for quickly killing birds are inhumane, though they are particularly opposed to ventilation shutdown, which they note can take hours and is akin to leaving a dog in a hot car. Animal rights groups delivered a petition last year signed by 3,577 people involved in caring for animals, including nearly 1,600 veterinarians, that urged the veterinary association to stop recommending ventilation shutdown as an option. 'We have to do better. None of these are acceptable in any way,' said Sara Shields, director of farm animal welfare science at Humane Society International. Opponents of the standard techniques said firefighting foam uses harmful chemicals and it essentially drowns birds, causing chickens and turkeys to suffer convulsions and cardiac arrest as they die. They say carbon dioxide is painful to inhale and detectible by the birds, prompting them to try to flee the gas. Karen Davis, of the nonprofit group United Poultry Concerns, urged the veterinary association to stop recommending all of its three main options. 'They're all ways that I would not choose to die, and I would not choose anybody else to die regardless of what species they belong to,' Davis said. Shields said there are more humane alternatives, such as using nitrogen gas but those options tend to be more expensive and could have logistical challenges. Sam Krouse, vice president of Indiana-based MPS Egg Farms, said farmers feel miserable about using any of the options. 'We pour our lives and livelihoods into taking care of those birds, and it's just devastating when we lose any of those birds,' Krouse said. 'Everything that we're doing every day is focused on keeping the disease out and making sure that we're keeping our hens as safe as possible.' Officials emphasize that this virus that's spread primarily through the droppings of infected wild birds doesn't threaten food safety or represent a significant public health threat. Sick birds aren't allowed into the food supply and properly cooking poultry and eggs kills any viruses that might be present. And health officials say no human cases of bird flu have been found in the United States during this current outbreak. Once poultry are dead, farmers must quickly dispose of the birds. They usually don't want to risk the chance of spreading the virus by transporting the carcasses to landfills, so crews typically pile the birds up into huge rows inside barns and combine them with other materials, such as ground up corn stalks and sawdust to create a compost pile. After a couple weeks of decomposition, the carcasses are converted into a material that can be spread on cropland to help fertilize crops. In some cases, carcasses are buried in trenches on the farm or incinerated. Eds: UPDATES: Updates the total number of birds killed in the last two months to reflect the latest confirmed cases.

{"id": "110", "title": "Minnesota Legislature approves emergency $1M for bird flu", "date": "2022-04-08", "fulltext": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The Minnesota Legislature rushed through $1 million in emergency funding Thursday to bolster the fight against bird flu, a highly contagious disease that has cost the state's turkey farmers more than 1 million birds. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Torrey Westrom, of Elbow Lake, pointed out before the unanimous vote in the Senate and the 129-1 vote in the House that the number of Minnesota farms and birds affected by the highly pathogenic form of bird flu has doubled in less than a week. Minnesota is the top turkey producing state, with nearly 700 farms that raise about 40 million birds per year. According to an update on Thursday from the Board of Animal Health, the virus had infected 19 commercial turkey farms and two backyard flocks in 11 Minnesota counties with a combined 1,017,568 birds. Across the U.S., the outbreak is the biggest since 2015, when producers had to kill more than 50 million birds to keep the virus from spreading. Cases have been reported in 24 states this year, with Iowa the hardest hit. The number of chickens and turkeys killed in the past two months has climbed to more than 24 million. Zoos across North America are moving their birds indoors and away from people and wildlife to protect them. Rep. John Burkel, a former turkey farmer from Badger, recounted how his farm in Roseau County was struck in 2015. That outbreak required euthanizing 9 million birds statewide. \"The virus is different this time, and the need and the urgency is greater,\" Burkel said. Rep. Dave Baker, of Willmar, who represents one of the hardest hit areas of Minnesota, said the cold weather and worker shortages are making it harder this time for producers to euthanize infected flocks because the foaming machines used to suffocate the birds don't work as well. The bill, which Gov. Tim Walz is expected to sign soon, is meant to buy time by putting an extra $1 million into an emergency account at the Minnesota Department of Agriculture to supplement the $400,000 currently there. It will help pay for testing materials, equipment and personnel. Lawmakers are expected to field requests for more money later.

{"id": "111", "title": "Deadly avian flu sends egg prices soaring", "date": "2022-04-08", "fulltext": "A deadly and highly infectious avian flu is forcing US farmers to kill millions of egg-laying hens, reducing the country's egg supply and driving up prices. On Thursday, retailers paid between $2.80 and $2.89 for a dozen large grade A white eggs in the Midwest, according to the USDA's daily Midwest regional egg report. That's more than double the roughly $1.25 they cost in March, according to data compiled by Brian Earnest, lead protein industry analyst at Cobank, which provides financial services to agribusiness. Typically, large white eggs in that region cost somewhere between $0.70 and $1.10 per dozen, said Earnest, who noted that the Midwest prices serve as a national benchmark. Around Easter, when demand is high, those prices can reach about $2, he said—far lower than they were on Thursday. Higher feed costs and supply chain difficulties have made many food items more expensive this year, and eggs are no exception. But this particular spike is being driven by the highly pathogenic avian influenza that has been detected in flocks across the country, Earnest noted. It's the worst US outbreak of the bird flu since 2015. Though the flu is deadly for poultry, it is \"primarily an animal health issue,\" according to the Centers for Disease Control, which added that it believes \"the risk to the general public's health from current H5N1 bird flu viruses is low.\" Because the flu is so contagious and deadly to birds, the USDA protocol is to kill infected flocks to curb the spread of the disease. In Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer, \"we currently have more than a dozen sites impacted by the disease,\" including three facilities where hens lay eggs, said Chloe Carson, communications director of the Iowa Department of Agriculture. As a result \"we have had to depopulate 11.2 million laying hens,\" out of about 56 million laying hens in Iowa overall, she said. This particular strain of the flu is being spread by wild migratory birds, Carson explained. The migration season typically lasts from March to May, she noted. \"As long as the migration patterns continue, there is a risk for disease to continue to be introduced to our domestic populations,\" Carson said. Pricier eggs this summer Although wholesale egg prices are spiking, that doesn't mean supermarkets are passing those costs onto consumers, explained Earnest. Retailers will often \"take a loss on eggs to draw in store traffic,\" he said. Generally, around Easter or Christmas, when people are more likely to bake, \"we'll see a reduced price on-shelf for eggs.\" So rather than raising prices, some stores appear to be dealing with the higher costs by eliminating their egg promotions. \"Retail promotional activity was very limited and offered little incentive for shoppers to buy beyond immediate needs,\" according to the USDA's weekly egg markets overview, published last Friday. Eventually, however, prices are likely to go up. \"I would expect we're going to see at least a 30 or 40 percent premium on top of [typical prices] through the summer months this year as a result of the tighter supply,\" Earnest said. He also noted that even before the flu was detected in the US earlier this year, the number of egg-laying hens was relatively low. And frozen or dry egg inventories are \"down significantly from what they typically are,\" he said. That could mean there will be some egg shortages later this year.", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "As long as the migration patterns continue, there is a risk for disease to continue to be introduced to our domestic populations,", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Because the flu is so contagious and deadly to birds, the USDA protocol is to kill infected flocks to curb the spread of the disease.", "affirm_why_count": 1, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "It's the worst US outbreak of the bird flu since 2015.", "affirm_keywords_count": 1, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_statement_1": "Though the flu is deadly for poultry, it is 'primarily an animal health issue,' according to the Centers for Disease Control, which added that it believes 'the risk to the general public's health from current H5N1 bird flu viruses is low.'", "deny_why_count": 1, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "112", "title": "Millions of bird deaths as US hit by avian flu outbreak", "date": "2022-04-09", "fulltext": "US officials believe nearly 24m poultry birds, mostly chickens and turkeys, have died of flu since virus strain identified in February. Millions of birds have died in the US in recent weeks, because of a contagious strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, popularly known as bird flu. The bird flu has also led zoos across the US to temporarily close aviary exhibits and move birds away from the public. At zoos from Colorado to Maryland, species ranging from ostriches to penguins have been moved indoors. The virus poses a low risk to humans, but the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has estimated that nearly 24m poultry birds, mostly chickens and turkeys, have died of the flu since February, when a flock of turkeys in Indiana were confirmed to have the virus. The bird flu has been seen in at least 24 states. Last seen in the US in 2015, bird flu arrives through wild migratory birds, the season for which lasts from March to May. Wild birds, including waterfowl like ducks and geese, tend to not get sick when infected. Farmed chickens and turkeys are highly susceptible. As a result, poultry meat and eggs are in tighter supply. In Iowa, the state that produces the most eggs, more than 11m of 56m egg-laying hens have died. 'As long as the [wild bird] migration patterns continue, there is a risk for disease to continue to be introduced to our domestic population,' Chloe Carson, the communications director of the Iowa agriculture department, told CNN. Egg prices have risen. The average price of a dozen eggs has reached $2.60, compared to around $1.40 at the same time last year, according to the USDA. The agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, told reporters on Tuesday that because poultry facilities developed stricter containment measures after the last bird flu outbreak in 2015, they are better equipped to prevent the virus spreading. 'The nature of the outbreaks, the size of the operations that have been impacted, the number of states that are dealing with backyard operations as opposed to commercial-sized operations, would strongly suggest that when this is all said and done, it's going to be significantly less than what we experienced in 2014-15,' Vilsack said. ZOO UPDATE: Cases of avian flu have been confirmed across the US, including Maryland. This strain of the disease is highly contagious and lethal to birds. As a precautionary measure, most avian species will be off exhibit until the threat has subsided. Zoos have also taken precautionary measures. In a statement, the Maryland zoo said: 'We have moved birds that are more likely to come in contact with migrating waterfowl. These birds have been moved to indoor housing. Because the disease can be tracked on shoes, zoo aviaries have been closed and indoor contact with birds is limited to a small number of staff.' While previous bird flu viruses have affected humans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has noted that this current virus has so far posed a low risk to the general public's health.

Cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) have been rising in backyard flocks and wild birds across dozens of states in recent months, prompting zoo officials to temporarily shut down bird exhibits. \"This strain of the disease is highly contagious and lethal to birds,\" the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore said in a statement on its website. \"As a precautionary measure, we have closed our aviaries and moved several of our bird species to behind-the-scenes facilities with limited human contact until the threat of avian influenza has subsided.\" Birds in zoos could get infected by wild birds, humans or a new bird introduced to the facility. The avian flu was first detected in February in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, according to the US Department of Agriculture. This was the first case of infection in the US since 2020. The disease caused by the flu has been detected in commercial and backyard flocks across 24 states and in wild birds across 31 states, according to the department. The Type A viruses naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry along with bird and animal species, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They don't usually affect humans, it said. The spread has led zoos in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas and Ohio in addition to Maryland to take preventative steps, including closing outdoor bird exhibits and moving the birds indoors for their safety. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) established the Zoo and Aquarium All Hazards Partnership program, which collaborates with zoos to create a plan before outbreaks occur. Preventative measures include putting up tarps or netting around the exhibits, closing walk-through aviaries to the public and implementing strong quarantine protocols, according to Rob Vernon, AZA's senior vice president for communications and strategy. \"Facilities are going to be in full response mode to protect their birds for at least the next couple of months until transmission decreases,\" Vernon told CNN in a statement. Zoos take precautionary measures In an effort to prevent infections, zoos have taken various steps to keep their birds safe. The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium has barred the public from accessing birds including ostriches, chickens and owls. Visitors may see flamingos and penguins through the glass of their indoor habitats. In Colorado, the Denver Zoo moved its birds indoors for at least 28 days, it said in a statement. Dr. Ann Duncan, who heads animal health at Detroit Zoological Society, said moving birds indoors is a crucial preventive measure. \"By bringing these animals indoors, we can more closely monitor them and prevent contact with wild birds who may be carriers of HPAI,\" Duncan said in a February news release from the Detroit Zoo. The Maryland Zoo is adhering to a multi-tiered response plan reviewed by the USDA as well as other state departments, it said in a statement. The zoo, which has the largest colony of African penguins in North America, has not detected cases -- but the case count is close enough to move its birds indoors, according to its senior communications director, Mike Evitts. \"We are hatching penguin chicks as part of a plan to increase their numbers with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums breeding program as part of a global conservation effort,\" he said. Prompted by an abundance of caution, the Milwaukee County Zoo's Aviary and Humboldt Penguin exhibit has temporarily closed, according to its website. The Dallas Zoo also moved its birds away from public-facing enclosures \"until the threat has passed,\" saying animal health experts will continue to monitor and follow protocols as needed, the zoo said in a statement. Ohio's Columbus Zoo also shuttered some bird habitats as they undergo monitoring and evaluation, according to its director of communication, Jen Fields.

Inflation coupled with the bird flu is driving up the price of eggs ahead of Easter. Eggs are also a symbol for the Jewish holiday Passover, which begins at sundown Friday, and has a place on families' Seder plates. Egg prices are higher than they were last year and in recent history, according to data released Tuesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Consumer Price Index, which measures the average change paid by consumers for goods and services, leaped 8.5% annually, the fastest pace since December 1981, the Labor Department said Tuesday. That's up from 7.9% in February and inflation now has notched new 40-year highs for five straight months.

Egg prices typically see a spike in late March to early April depending on when Easter falls as demand increases. Often, the holiday is when retailers discount eggs. The latest USDA data shows signs of prices dropping in the last week. Consumer demand for shell eggs declined as shoppers are finding little incentive at the local grocer to buy beyond normal needs, the USDA said in its Egg Markets Overview report from April 8. Plastic eggs have been encroaching on shell egg demand during Easter for years but shell eggs have managed to hold their own for holiday baking needs. According to Numerator's Easter 2022 Consumer Sentiment Study, 75% of consumers expect inflation to impact their shopping. The National Retail Federation found inflation concerns were driving consumers to seek the most value for their dollar when shopping for the Easter holiday. How to crack the high price of eggs USA TODAY asked readers how they planned on saving on egg purchases. Here are some of their strategies along with expert advice. Buy eggs in bulk at Costco, Sam's Club Many said they'd shop at wholesale clubs like Costco and buy eggs in bulk. Some said they'd shop more at bigger chains like Walmart or Target. Kristin McGrath, a shopping expert and editor at deal website RetailMeNot, also suggests shopping wholesale to save. For saving on real eggs to paint and decorate for Easter Sunday, scan local grocery stores' weekly coupon offerings for savings on eggs, or head to a warehouse store like Sam's Club for bulk discounts on large quantities of eggs, McGrath told USA TODAY. USA TODAY visited stores in Coral Springs, Florida and found Costco had the lowest egg price with five dozen eggs for $8.39 and two dozen for $3.69. The second-lowest was Aldi at $1.90 a dozen. COSTCO DEALS: Here's the key to saving money so you can buy more $1.50 hot-dog-and-soda combos GAS SAVINGS: Here's how to save money on gas with a Costco, Sam's Club, Walmart+ and Kroger membership Using plastic eggs for Easter Many readers told USA TODAY they were turning more to plastic eggs for holiday celebrations. One way to save for future holidays is to pick up Easter decor on holiday clearance, McGrath said. If you want to save the absolute most for next year, head to your big-box store, craft store or even grocery store of choice the day after Easter to get non-perishable plastic eggs and egg-decorating kits for upwards of 80% off, McGrath said. You'll save yourself the last-minute shopping stress for Easter 2023 and get the absolutely lowest price possible. No eggs this Easter A few readers told USA TODAY that because of higher egg prices and other increased costs like gas, they are skipping real eggs this holiday. Others are turning to local farmers to buy eggs and some said they had backyard hens.

(AP) — Two cases of bird flu have been confirmed in U.S. zoos, but officials said they won't order widespread euthanasia of zoo birds the way they have on farms. U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman Mike Stepien declined to release any details about the zoo cases Thursday, including which two zoos were involved. Many zoos across the country have closed down their aviaries and moved birds inside whenever possible to help protect them from avian influenza that officials believe is primarily being spread by the droppings of wild birds. At many zoos, penguins might be the only birds visitors can see because they are generally kept inside behind glass where they are shielded from the virus. Nearly 27 million chickens and turkeys have been slaughtered in 26 states to limit the spread of bird flu during this year's outbreak. Officials order entire flocks to be killed when the virus is found on farms. Stepien said zoos work with state veterinary officials when the virus is found, but unlike farms, zoos are generally allowed to isolate and treat an infected bird as long as they take precautions to protect the other birds in their collections. Health officials emphasize that bird flu doesn't jeopardize food safety because infected birds aren't allowed into the food supply and properly cooking meat and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses. The disease also doesn't represent any immediate public health threat, and no human cases have been found in America. This year's outbreak is the worst one since 2015 when roughly 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered because of the virus. Stepien said that there were very few bird flu cases in captive wild birds in 2015 and none in large zoos, and no wild birds at zoos were euthanized that year.

The University of Georgia's Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Diseases Study said it confirmed the avian flu in the eagles Thursday. It marks the first time the virus has been confirmed in the species in Georgia, officials said. Researchers first detected the disease in the dead eagles found in Chatham, Glynn and Liberty counties in March. Lab tests at the United States Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the results. The deaths of the bald eagles in Georgia are the latest reported across the nation. Last month, two bald eagles in Vermont were found to be infected with avian influenza, state wildlife officials announced. North Carolina also reported the death of a bald eagle in that state in March. Nationwide, federal officials have confirmed more than 660 cases of the avian flu in wild birds this year, including 11 cases in Georgia.

(AP) — Avian influenza has been confirmed in a backyard poultry flock in Livingston County, the state Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said Friday, bringing to four the number of southeastern Michigan counties where the virus has been detected. The premise where the bird flu was found is under quarantine and the birds have been destroyed to prevent further spread of the virus, the department said. The flock contained about 20 birds of multiple species, it said. The finding underscores the ongoing high risk for the disease in Michigan, the department said in urging poultry owners to implement every strategy necessary to protect their flocks. Bird flu can spread in various ways, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers, the department said. We are strongly encouraging all flock owners to take steps to better protect their poultry and help reduce the spread of this disease. Now is the time for action, State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland said. The department recommends preventing contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed, washing hands and disinfecting gear before and after handling birds and when moving between different coops. It also recommends keeping poultry feed secure to ensure no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources said March 24 that bird flu had been detected in free-ranging Canada geese and tundra swans from St. Clair County, in snowy owls from Macomb County and in a mute swan from Monroe County.

{"id": "126", "title": "At Least 36 Bald Eagles Have Died in Bird-Flu Outbreak; Highly contagious viral disease comes as U.S. national symbol faces population growth problems", "date": "2022-04-18", "fulltext": "Bald eagles are among the millions of birds nationwide being infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza, a viral disease with a high mortality rate for birds like chickens and raptors. Since February, at least 36 bald eagles have died from the bird flu across the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The escalating bird-flu outbreak is one of the worst in the U.S. in several years, according to the Agriculture Department, spreading along Florida, up the East Coast and as far west as Colorado and the Dakotas. The highly contagious disease is also hitting egg-laying flocks of chickens, as well as commercially raised turkeys, leading to a surge in egg and turkey breast prices. For the bald eagle, the outbreak comes as the population faces another deadly problem: a high incidence of lead poisoning. A study published in February found population growth rates for bald eagles are being suppressed by 3.8% because of lead exposure. Lead, a neurotoxin, has many sublethal effects on eagles that affect their health and ability to defend their territory and produce eggs. \"It's concerning,\" said Victoria Hall, executive director at the Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota. \"You're pairing a population who's already dealing with a lead toxicity problem now with highly pathogenic avian influenza.\" In recent weeks, 12 bald eagles with bird flu have arrived at the Raptor Center. The eagles, who were otherwise at their prime age for breeding, were at the end-stage of the virus and suffered from issues like seizures and being unable to stand, according to Dr. Hall. Humane euthanasia was the best option for them at that stage, she said. \"We're seeing more bald eagles die from high-path avian influenza than we've previously documented in any outbreak of this virus,\" Dr. Hall said. \"And it's interesting, because many of these birds also have lead poisoning.\" About 85% to 90% of eagles brought to the center have levels of lead in the blood and about 25% to 30% have lethal levels, Dr. Hall said. Eagles are hunters, but they also scavenge, including on dead animals and bits of carcass shot and left behind by human hunters. Most hunting ammunition is made of lead, and bullets can fragment when entering an animal's body, possibly contaminating remains. \"Right now I don't think we can say anything except both lead toxicity and HPAI were present in some of the birds,\" said Dr. Hall. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month the bird-flu outbreak poses a low risk to the general public, as it is predominantly an issue among animals. Human infections from bird-flu viruses are rare, according to the CDC. Bald eagles were removed from the federal list of endangered species in 2007. Their population in the lower 48 states has grown from 72,434 individual birds, including 30,548 breeding pairs, in 2009, to 316,700 individual eagles, including 71,467 breeding pairs, between 2018 and 2019, according to a report from the Interior Department last year. It is unclear what the broader and long-term impact of this bird-flu outbreak on the bald eagle's population will be as it is still under way, Dr. Hall said. \"We are seeing significant mortality,\" she said, \"and the better data we can collect about what is happening in these populations, the better we can figure out how we can best support them.\" Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com", "media_outlet": "WSJ", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month the bird-flu outbreak poses a low risk to the general public, as it is predominantly an issue among animals.

The US is enduring the worst bird flu outbreak since 2015 in terms of domestic poultry deaths, according to new data from the US Department of Agriculture, with the avian sickness responsible for millions of deaths in commercial farms. But the flu is also affecting wild birds and since February, at least 36 bald eagles have died in 14 states as a result of contracting the virus and eagles in two other states are suspected of falling sick with the strain. Georgia's department of natural resources announced that three bald eagles that have died in the state tested positive with bird flu and that other eagle carcasses are being checked. Other wild birds affected in the state include the lesser scaup, gadwall and the American wigeon. The latest strain, H5N1, has also been detected in bald eagles in other states including Florida, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin. According to the USDA, wild birds can be infected with bird flu and display no signs of illness. The birds can carry the disease to new areas when migrating and can expose domestic poultry to the virus. USDA experts anticipate new additional avian influenza detections will occur in additional states as wild bird surveillance continues in the spring. The threat of the bird flu to humans remains low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the sweeping bird flu has been taking a toll on the poultry industry. Since 3 April, the outbreak has resulted in the culling of more than 23 million poultry, including chickens and turkeys.

Florida judge voids US mask mandate for planes, other travel A federal judge in Florida voided the national mask mandate covering airplanes and other public transportation as exceeding the authority of U.S. health officials. The CDC recently extended the mask mandate until May 3 to allow more time to study the BA.2 omicron subvariant of the coronavirus that is now responsible for the vast majority of cases in the U.S. The mask requirement for travelers was the target of months of lobbying from the airlines, which sought to kill it. The carriers argued that effective air filters on modern planes make transmission of the virus during a flight unlikely. Republicans in Congress also fought to kill the mandate. So far, it's unclear what the ruling means for travelers in the near term. Should we be worried? Mask mandates are returning in some places amid rising COVID-19 cases.

{"id": "131", "title": "Avian flu has spread to 27 states, sharply driving up egg prices", "date": "2022-04-18", "fulltext": "The price of eggs has soared in recent weeks in part because of a huge bird flu wave that has infected nearly 27 million chickens and turkeys in the United States, forcing many farmers to 'depopulate' or destroy their animals to prevent a further spread. The virus has impacted many different bird species, including penguins and bald eagles. But its spread among poultry has been tremendous, particularly among chickens raised for their eggs. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced yet another outbreak, this one in two flocks in Idaho, making that the 27th state in which the virus has been found since February. According to the USDA, the price of a dozen eggs in November hovered around $1. Right now, that price is $2.95 and rising. The illness affects commercial birds, hobbyists' backyard chicken flocks and wild birds, and is spread via secretions and leads to paralysis, swelling and diminished egg production. There have been no human cases of these avian influenza viruses detected in the United States. So far, about 1.3 percent of all U.S. chickens have been affected in this outbreak and about 6 percent of the U.S. turkey flock, said Grady Ferguson, senior research analyst for Gro Intelligence, an agriculture data platform. Ferguson tracked the last major outbreak of bird flu in 2015, saying that this outbreak has the potential to be more significant and disruptive to the poultry and egg markets. During the last epidemic, at this point in the outbreak, 66 days after first detection, the percentage of total chickens affected was 0.02 percent, ultimately climbing to around 2.5 percent of chickens infected and 50 million birds destroyed. 'We are above and beyond the rate of spread we saw in 2015,' Ferguson said. 'Last time, 81 percent of the cases were in the fourth and fifth month, as things exploded. What chicken egg prices did last time affected the market for years. We are two months into the outbreak now, and the safety protocols haven't worked. I don't want to be a Chicken Little, but I think it's going to be worse than last time.' He said in addition to higher prices for a carton of a dozen eggs, consumers 'will see higher prices for all baked goods and a wide variety of processed foods from cupcakes to salad dressing. Restaurants are going to have a harder time justifying why they should give you a three-egg omelet for a dollar. And on the chicken meat side, the situation is also worse this time than it was last time.' The majority of birds that had to be destroyed last time were laying hens and pullets (these are sexually immature birds that will be layers) and very few broilers (the birds consumers eat) were affected, Ferguson said. Thus far in this outbreak, 9 percent of affected animals are broiler chickens, he said, which will lead to already-high prices for chicken going even higher. Tom Super, senior vice president of communications for the National Chicken Council, said that chicken farmers are 'doubling and tripling down' on biosecurity at chicken farms, adding protocols like showers for workers as they enter and exit a facility, and antiseptic tire baths for trucks so that infection isn't moved from one facility to another. Super said that avian flu will add to the cost of chicken, but that is just one of several price pressures right now. He lists higher feed costs for animals, higher fuel costs for transporting animals and even the Biden administration's decision to allow higher levels of ethanol in gasoline, which further drives up the price of corn and soy essential for animal feed. Emily Metz, president of the American Egg Board, said that about 5 percent of laying hen flocks have been affected so far, but that she is more optimistic about the trajectory of this outbreak. 'The bottom line is we started a little bit earlier than we did in 2015 [with biosecurity protocols],' she said. 'We learned some tough lessons in 2015, that our biosecurity wasn't where it needed to be. We've invested in huge changes.' She described high-tech new protocols such as laser light systems to ward off migratory birds to prevent them from landing on the farmland or buildings. And while she admits prices are rising, she points to farmers' input costs as a greater factor than the specter of avian flu. 'It is alarming, and I share in the concern about affordability. But eggs are still one of the most affordable proteins, bar none,' she said.

The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food said Monday that officials had euthanized an unspecified number of infected birds to prevent them from entering the food system. They cordoned off the area where they had lived. Proper steps have been taken to prevent further spread of the disease, said Utah State Veterinarian Dr. Dean Taylor. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed that detection of the avian flu did not present immediate concerns to humans, public health or the food system. However, they warned poultry owners to prevent their flocks from coming into contact with wild birds and monitor for sickness or unusual deaths. Though not an immediate health risk, reports of the virus can raise fears among the poultry industry of an outbreak that could decimate their stock.

{"id": "133", "title": "Minnesota's governor, senators praise state's bird flu fight", "date": "2022-04-19", "fulltext": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) Minnesota's governor and U.S. senators went to the heart of the state's poultry country Tuesday for a first-hand look at how the top turkey-producing state is fighting bird flu, and said the state is better positioned now than it was during the devastating 2015 outbreak. Gov. Tim Walz and Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith visited an emergency operations center in Willmar where state and federal agencies are working to contain the current outbreak. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says it has cost chicken and turkey producers 28.2 million birds in 29 states so far. In Minnesota, the toll is nearly 2 million birds at 40 farms. We remain hopeful. The fight is still on. We've got another four to six weeks probably, maybe a little shorter if we get some decent weather here, Walz said at a news conference. Klobuchar pointed out that Minnesota producers lost 9 million birds in 2015, mostly turkeys but also broiler and egg-laying chickens. Officials and the industry have learned a lot since then about how the virus is transmitted and they know better how to ward it off. And while the system for compensating farmers was just a mess last time, she said, that process has been improved. Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen said Minnesota saw a steady increase in new cases in May 2015 before they started winding down. The state may not be halfway through this new outbreak, he said, but it's behaving differently. State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said this outbreak is being spread mostly by wild waterfowl, not flock-to-flock as in 2015. Commercial and backyard flock owners have stepped up biosecurity to prevent tracking it from barn to barn, she said, and that should limit the number of affected farms. Relief is expected to come when those migrating waterfowl make their way through the Midwest, she said. Bad weather has caused many of them to stop in the region and leave the virus behind. Officials can't make those birds leave, she said, but they will head north as the weather improves. The environment needs to warm up, and we need to heat up, and we need to dry out, Thompson said. The leaders also said more mental health services are now available to help producers and farm workers cope with the stresses and financial shocks from having to destroy entire flocks. Everybody needs help at one time or another, and asking for help is a sign of strength, not of weakness, Smith said.

Bird flu virus strikes Here are where bald eagles testing positive for the bird flu virus have died, and how many died in each state, according to USDA data as of Thursday: Florida: 9 Georgia: 3 Kansas: 2 Maine: 2 Minnesota: 2 Nebraska: 1 North Carolina: 3 North Dakota: 2 Ohio: 2 Pennsylvania: 1 South Carolina: 3 South Dakota: 3 Vermont: 3 Wisconsin: 1 Bald eagles in 14 states died after contracting bird flu, and eagles in another two states are suspected of falling ill with the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In total, 36 bald eagles have died since February. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources reported Thursday that three bald eagles in the state that died recently tested positive for the bird flu virus. Other dead bald eagles also will be tested. Officials said recent aerial surveys of eagle nests on the state's coast revealed several failed nests, including eaglets dead or missing when they normally wouldn't have left the nest yet. Bob Sargent, program manager with the department's wildlife conservation section, said nest success is down about 30% this year. On April 8, a bald eagle in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was found unable to fly. Wildlife rehabilitators with the Wisconsin Humane Society collected and cared for the bird in Milwaukee. It was euthanized the next day after its condition deteriorated. Initial test results on the eagle released Friday showed it was 'presumed positive' for the virus. Tens of millions of domestic and wild birds have died or were euthanized as a result of the disease, which is especially deadly to domestic poultry. It has been detected in 32 states as of Saturday, most recently Utah and Idaho. The bird flu is considered a low risk to humans, but Americans are feeling the effects. The outbreak is expected to raise the cost of poultry products and eggs this year. Shoppers can expect to pay 6% to 7% more for poultry products and 2.5% to 3.5% for eggs at the grocery store.

{"id": "135", "title": "Worst bird flu in years drives up egg prices, prompts precautions against spread to humans", "date": "2022-04-19", "fulltext": "With food prices rising rapidly, Francine Eubanks wasn't even aware a highly contagious avian flu spreading across the country had suddenly edged egg costs higher for her busy bagel shop. But her customers, like many across the country, are paying more for the bagels, knishes and pastries at her Bagel King deli in Deltona, Florida. 'I just raised my prices about four days ago,' Eubanks said last week. 'I watch my profit and loss really closely, and when I see it going in the wrong direction, I raise my prices. Everybody has to pay more. It's just sad.' Egg prices more than doubled nationally in March, according to the Urner Barry Egg Index, a blend of egg values in the wholesale market. That's in part because of the drastic measures taken to try to curb the spread of the mutating bird flu virus, the worst outbreak since 2014-2015. More than 24 million domestic chickens, turkey and other domestic birds have been killed in the U.S. since February. While the risk to people is low with this outbreak, scientists have rising concerns about the increasing threats of animal-borne viruses spreading to people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends farmers, poultry workers and hunters take steps to protect themselves and contain the virus. No human cases have been documented from this strain of the avian flu in the U.S., and only one was reported in Europe, said Todd Davis, lead of the CDC's zoonotic virus team in virology surveillance. Eating poultry and eggs is safe, as long as they are fully cooked, the CDC said. BIRD FLU: Bald eagles in 14 states have died amid bird flu outbreak OUTBREAK: Zoos are sequestering birds as avian flu spreads across North America Among birds, avian flu can be deadly and spread rapidly. When it's detected in a commercial poultry flock, federal rules require the birds to be killed to try to 'tamp out' the virus, said Bryan Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center. One Iowa farm laid off more than 200 employees after an outbreak forced the destruction of 5.3 million laying hens. The farm deaths ignited protests among animal rights activists. A woman quickly dubbed 'Blue Girl' was removed from an NBA game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Los Angeles Clippers on April 13 after she sprayed adhesive on the court and tried to glue herself to the floor to protest the euthanasia of birds on a farm belonging to Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor. Zoos in at least a half dozen states have shuttered aviaries to protect their birds. Backyard flock owners are keeping their chickens in and trying to keep wild waterfowl out of farm ponds to protect their birds. After the virus was reported in 41 countries during the latter half of 2021, U.S. and Canadian officials were on high alert, swabbing live birds and ducks taken by hunters to monitor for it, Richards said. This strain of the avian flu made its first appearance in North America in late November, in great black backed gulls in Newfoundland, where birds sometimes land after being blown across the Atlantic from Europe. By April 18, the virus had taken flight in the U.S. and was reported in more than 230 counties in 37 states and at least six Canadian provinces. In addition to domestic chickens, turkeys and ducks, USGS data shows at least 32 species of wild birds have been infected in the U.S., including bald eagles, snowy owls, swans and white pelicans. This virus is not related to the still unidentified pathogen that made songbirds sick last year, Richards said. Maps of the outbreak this spring showed the flu moving along the Missouri River basin, 'very clearly on the wings' of migrating waterfowl, Richards said. But the timing was fortunate because the flu began spreading just as the birds were dispersing, rather than being gathered in large winter congregations that could be 'virus factories,' he said. An outbreak in Israel where 40,000 common cranes were gathered killed 8,000 of them in a matter of weeks. Scientists are monitoring avian flu and other pathogens in animals more closely than ever because of the rising threat the viruses could spread to people, or back and forth between people and animals, mutating into different strains as they go. The opportunities for new emerging pathogens to appear and spill over into people has increased in recent decades, researchers said. For example, Richards pointed to the COVID-19 virus, which was found in a host of captive and wild animals, including lions, tigers, gorillas, cats, dogs, deer and mink. 'We've created opportunities where wildlife, humans and domestic animals literally share time and space,' he said. 'Pathogens can leverage those opportunities.' That potential has prompted calls from some scientists to strengthen reporting techniques and information sharing around the world to minimize the risk of another global pandemic. This H5 strain of the avian flu has been evolving in the world's birds since the late 1990s, mutating and swapping genes with other avian influenza, said the CDC's Davis. One version of the virus has caused 863 human infections in 18 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. Of those, 455 were fatal. The strain circulating now lacks genetic characteristics associated with human infection. While catastrophic to poultry, the CDC considers the risk low to humans. The single European case was a person with no symptoms and prolonged exposure to ducks that lived indoors, Davis said. People who may be exposed by handling wild birds or working in affected commercial operations should be aware of the potential for infection and take extra precautions. For example, hunters and individuals handling wild birds should wash their hands. People working to decontaminate poultry farms are advised to wear N95 face masks and gloves, and in some cases protective gowns. Davis said these people should also get tested if they experience any flu symptoms. 'There's still things we don't know,' such as the overall potential for exposure, he said. 'So we want to be extra cautious, especially with the highly pathogenic strains.' INDIANA FARM: Bird flu found on poultry farm in Indiana, nearly 30,000 turkeys killed to contain spread Dead birds should be reported to state wildlife hotlines and bird watchers have been advised to avoid spreading mud from wetlands and swampy areas with their boots, cars and equipment. American Poultry Association members who raise birds for enjoyment and show have also worked to protect their flocks from exposure, said David Adkins, secretary/treasurer and a competition judge. Georgia state officials canceled the association's semi-annual show in February. Similar shows and fair exhibitions have been canceled in at least five states, including Iowa, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Adkins said he feels bad for youths in 4-H and Future Farmers of America chapters who haven't been able to display the poultry they've raised. Using toy stuffed birds to demonstrate their showmanship just isn't the same, he said: 'It's hard on those kids when they spent the time raising their project.' Richards and other scientists hope to see the impacts of the virus diminish as spring migration comes to a close. And they hope this outbreak doesn't match the 2014-15 season, when 50 million birds were killed.

{"id": "138", "title": "Dozens of Bald Eagles Have Died From Bird Flu", "date": "2022-04-21", "fulltext": "The H5N1 strain of avian influenza is spreading among many raptors and wild birds, including the national bird. With millions of chickens on commercial poultry farms sickened and dying from a highly virulent strain of avian flu in recent months, it might have escaped notice that some of the nation's most stunning wild birds have also been felled by the virus. The virus has taken an unusual toll on raptors or birds of prey, including more than three dozen bald eagles. Because the spring is nesting season, some experts are worried that avian flu may pose a serious threat to the birds' potential offspring. In Minneapolis, a beloved family of great horned owls living by Lake Nokomis has died of avian flu. In Florida, black vultures have been infected. And in Georgia, three infected bald eagles were found dead in coastal counties. The H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, which is widespread in Europe, was first reported in North America in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador in December 2021. By mid-January, the virus had infected an American wigeon and blue-winged teal in South Carolina, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Waterfowl, which are natural hosts of avian flu, have been especially hard hit. The 763 reported wild bird infections, according to the U.S.D.A., include snow geese in North and South Dakota, northern shovelers in North Carolina, brown pelicans in Florida, mallards in Minnesota and several unidentified ducks in Ohio. Bald eagles hunt living prey and scavenge carcasses, which offer a possible route of transmission for the virus. 'If the waterfowl are dying, then eagles can pick it up from eating those dead waterfowl,' said Krysten Schuler, the co-director of the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab. The U.S.D.A. has reported 41 dead bald eagles infected with the virus since February, a number that does not include two more bald eagles that Dr. Schuler confirmed were infected in New York in late March, she said. This month, bald eagles have been infected in Ohio, South Dakota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Vermont, Maine and North Dakota. Bald eagles have long been considered a conservation success story. Populations were driven nearly to extinction by the synthetic insecticide DDT: In 1963, there were only 417 known nesting pairs. But decades of conservation efforts, along with a 1972 ban of DDT, allowed the species to recover and eventually be removed from Endangered Species Act protection in 2007. Despite this rebound, many bald eagles suffer from chronic lead poisoning. As the birds scavenge on hunted carcasses, they can ingest lead from ammunition, according to a paper published this year in the journal Science. This widespread, long-term exposure stressed the resilience of bald eagle populations, according to a study published this year by Dr. Schuler and colleagues in The Journal of Wildlife Management. New threats to the species, such as wind turbines or a bird flu strain, could threaten its long-term success. 'The resilience of these animals was very close to the edge,' Dr. Schuler said. 'If a few more breeding adults died, that could actually have a pretty big impact on the future growth of these populations.' It is not yet clear how this bird flu will affect the species' recovery. 'I'm concerned it will be endemic, and there's already been reports of some recombination, which means there's this new strain mixing with some of the North American versions we have and creating new viruses,' Dr. Schuler said. 'We always worry about those.' But it appears the virus will harm nesting success — the ability of a nest to produce at least one young bird capable of flight — among certain populations this year, according to a statement from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Aerial surveys of nesting bald eagles in six coastal counties in Georgia have revealed nest success was down 30 percent this year, according to the statement. Some wild birds infected with avian influenza can show no symptoms, but infection can also lead to neurological problems, which can make it difficult for a bird to fly or right itself. At Back to the Wild, a rehabilitation center in Ohio, bald eagles believed to have bird flu appear unsteady on their feet and are unable to fly; some have even had seizures. 'All are admitted with the same symptoms and pass away within hours of admission,' said Heather Tuttle, the director of education at the center, adding that the rate of admission has started to slow down. Of the dozen brought into the center, none have survived. There is no effective treatment. Avian flu poses little threat to people, and no cases of H5N1 bird flu infection have been reported in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People should avoid direct contact with wild birds and their feces, and hunters should avoid harvesting or handling wild birds that are sick or found dead. Hunters should also wash their hands with soap and water after touching game birds and cook meat to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Some experts have advised people to take down bird feeders to reduce the spread of H5N1 in wild birds. But Dr. Schuler has not seen many birds that use feeders, such as songbirds, infected with the virus. 'So it doesn't seem like that is a major source of potential transmission,' she said. But bird feeders can still spread other pathogens and parasites, such as the bacteria that cause house finch eye disease, so it is still important to keep them clean. Instead, Dr. Schuler suggests maintaining vigilance about the spread of bird flu and reporting any unusual mortalities or birds that appear to have neurological issues.

{"id": "139", "title": "Michigan residents asked to take down bird feeders as avian flu cases spread", "date": "2022-04-21", "fulltext": "DETROIT—With more cases of bird flu detected in wild and domestic birds across Michigan, the Department of Natural Resources suggests Michiganders take down their bird feeders and birdbaths out of an abundance of caution. Birds flock to Michigan in April and May as they migrate through the Great Lakes region after wintering in Central and South America. Migrating species, such as the colorful yellow-rumped warbler or the soaring broad-winged hawk, may seek out food sources in backyard bird feeders, causing some Michigan birders to worry about spreading avian influenza, also known as the highly pathogenic avian influenza. Bird flu was first detected in Michigan in late February. Birds at the Detroit Zoo were moved indoors in response to protect from bird flu exposure. More recent cases of bird flu have cropped up across the state. Positive sample of bird flu: More than 32,000 turkeys in North Carolina euthanized Bird flu outbreak: Bald eagles in 14 states have died Megan Moriarty, DNR state wildlife veterinarian, said in a statement that bird species vary in how likely they are to die from bird flu infection. While all birds are potentially susceptible to bird flu, domestic birds, such as chickens, cockatoos, or doves, are more vulnerable to fatal infection. In addition, some wild bird populations, like waterfowl, raptors and scavengers, are highly susceptible and have been particularly affected by this disease, Moriarty said in the statement. Songbirds appear less prone to bird flu, although Moriarty noted that testing of songbirds is limited and much is still unknown. If you’re concerned about this virus and want to act from a place of abundant caution, removing your bird feeders, for now, makes sense, but it isn’t yet a critical step, Moriarty said. With warmer springtime weather on the way, too, birds will have more natural food sources readily available to them. Bird feeder removal could be wise for those who see blue jays, crows, or ravens in their backyard because those species are deemed at high risk of bird flu. Birdbaths are also places for birds to come in contact and spread bird flu, and the DNR suggests temporarily removing baths until the HPAI bird flu spread in wild and domestic birds decreases, which may be months or longer. For those who wish to keep their bird feeders in place, Moriarty suggested a number of steps to reduce the spread of bird flu. Clean bird feeders with a diluted bleach solution (and rinse well) once per week. Regularly cleaning helps protect birds against other infections, including salmonella. Clean up birdseed that has fallen below the feeders to discourage large numbers of birds and other wildlife from congregating in a concentrated area.

{"id": "140", "title": "Bird flu drives free-range hens indoors to protect poultry", "date": "2022-04-24", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) Is it OK for free-range chickens to not range freely? That's a question free-range egg producers have been pondering lately as they try to be open about their product while also protecting chickens from a highly infectious bird flu that has resulted in the death of roughly 28 million poultry birds across the country. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that chickens be moved indoors to protect against the disease, but while some are keeping their hens inside, not everyone agrees. John Brunnquell, the CEO of Indiana-based Egg Innovations, which contracts with more than 50 farms in five states to produce free-range and pasture-raised eggs, said any of his chickens in states with bird flu cases will stay in confinement mode until the risk passes. We will keep them confined at least until early June, Brunnquell said. If we go four weeks with no more commercial breakouts then we'll look to get the girls back out. Bird flu cases have been identified in commercial chicken and turkey farms or in backyard flocks in 29 states, according to the USDA. Spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings of infected migrating wild birds. The farms Brunnquell contracts with are in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Wisconsin, all of which have had at least once case of bird flu. But some, like Mike Badger, the executive director of the American Pastured Poultry Producers Association, are taking a different approach. Badger, whose Pennsylvania-based nonprofit group has about 1,000 members across the country, believes birds kept outdoors are at less risk of infection than chickens and turkeys raised amid thousands of others in large, enclosed barns. We put them outside and they get in touch with the environment so I think they have a better immune system to be able to fight off threats as they happen, Badger said. Research has not clearly proven significant immune system differences in chickens housed outdoors versus indoors. And Badger speculates that lower density of animals, air movement and less sharing of equipment and staff in pasture-raised operations may contribute to a lack of virus infections. He said the decision whether to bring hens inside to wait out the annual migration of wild waterfowl is a farm-to-farm decision based on the comfort level with the risk acceptance. Commercial outdoor flocks make up only a small percentage of U.S. egg production. About 6 million hens, or 2% of national flock, are free-range and about 4.2 million hens, or 1.3% of U.S. egg production, are from pasture-raised chickens. Chickens are categorized as free-range or pasture-raised primarily by the amount of time they spend outdoors and space they are provided. Free-range chickens typically must have at least 21.8 square feet (2 square meters) of roaming space outdoors and remain out until temperatures drop below around 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 1 Celsius), according to the American Humane Association, which certifies egg operations. Pasture-raised chickens typically must have 108 square feet (10 square meters) outdoors each and remain outside most of the year except during inclement weather. The certifying organizations have protocols for high-risk situations and allow for temporary housing indoors a time period not specifically defined once a farm documents an outbreak near an outdoor flock. Certification agencies monitor farms to ensure they don't use bird flu as an excuse to keep birds inside too long. Brunnquell said none of his farms had infections during the last big outbreak in 2015, and he hasn't had any cases this year. Farmers in Europe have been dealing with the bird virus longer than those in the U.S., with cases reported as early as last December. The United Kingdom has ordered free-range hens to be housed inside to protect them from the avian flu, and that has forced changes to how those eggs are labeled in stores. Free-range packaging is still used but must be marked with an added label of barn eggs, according to a communications representative for the British Free Range Egg Producers Association. Each egg also is stamped with a No. 2 that denotes barn rather than No. 1 for free-range. For U.S. consumers, it means the free-range eggs they buy at a premium price could come from a chicken being temporarily kept inside. But producers say they think people who pay more for pasture-raised or free-range eggs have animal-welfare concerns and don't want the chickens to be endangered by the virus. Brunnquell also noted that the certification agencies monitor farms to ensure they don't use bird flu as an excuse to keep birds inside too long. Eggs of all kinds have grown costlier recently thanks to bird flu concerns and a national spike in food costs. Last week, prices for conventional eggs increased by 40 cents per dozen to $1.47 while cage-free egg prices rose 3 cents to $2.40 per dozen, according to the USDA. Organic eggs, which are from chickens required to have access to the outdoors, were selling for a national average of $4.39 a dozen last week, up from $3.65 the week before. The price of eggs used by bakeries and other food products soared to a record high on April 8. So-called breaker eggs, which will later be broken by processors and sold in containers weighing up to 50 pounds, peaked at $2.51 per pound, said Karyn Rispoli, egg market reporter for Urner Barry, a New Jersey-based food commodity market research and analytics firm. Many of the egg layers that have died from bird flu were on farms contracted to provide breaker eggs used as food product ingredients, Rispoli said. Bird flu likely will remain a problem for at least several more weeks as migrating waterfowl will remain on the move in the Mississippi Flyway until June. In the past, warmer weather and the end of migration brought an end to bird flu cases, allowing turkey and chicken farmers to begin the monthslong process of replenishing flocks and resuming production. ___ Associated Press writer Courtney Bonnell contributed to this report from London. ___ This story was first published on April 21.

{"id": "141", "title": "China detects first human case of H3N8 bird flu strain", "date": "2022-04-27", "fulltext": "Experts say widespread transmission of flu in birds is increasing scope for avian viruses to mix and mutate. An H3N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, in China's central province of Henan. The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China's National Health Commission. Avian influenza or bird flu as it is commonly known is a highly contagious viral disease with the first reports of human cases in the 1990s. Some strains of the bird flu, such as with H3N8 now, have been passed to humans but this is currently very rare, and usually occurs after very close contact with infected birds or animals. H3N8 viruses circulate widely in birds and in horses and have also been detected in dogs in North America. 'We often see a virus spread to a human and then not spread any further so a single case is not a cause of great concern,' said Sir Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health, University of Oxford. 'There is no reason to think it will go any further,' said Prof Paul Digard from the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, adding that Chinese authorities had not reported any illness in the immediate contacts of the infected boy. However, Horby and other disease experts said the widespread transmission and record number of outbreaks of avian flu in birds across the UK, US and Europe this year was a cause of concern as it increased the opportunity for avian viruses to mix and mutate and for human infection. 'I do generally believe we need to be increasing influence surveillance globally quite concertedly right now. Apart from H3N8, we have seen a number of other new spillover events of influenza from poultry to people over recent years including H5N8 in Russia and H7N9 and H10N3 in China,' said Alexandra Phelan, assistant professor at the centre for global health science and security at Georgetown University. Marius Gilbert, an epidemiologist at the Université libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, said a novel virus should always be looked at very carefully, 'especially when it is a reassortant, as it can have unpredictable capacity in terms of transmission and virulence in human populations.' Dr John McCauley, from the World Health Organization collaborating centre for reference and research on influenza, said the case was an 'unusual one' and was being investigated by the WHO and its counterparts in the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. In the UK, consumers can no longer buy free-range eggs, with birds not having been allowed outdoors since November due to close to 100 outbreaks of avian flu. However, there have been fewer than five cases of transmission from an infected bird to a human recorded in the UK, most recently in January, when a man caught it from ducks he kept inside his home.

Preventative measures include avoiding contact with poultry that appear ill or are dead and staying away from surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from wild or domestic birds. If handling wild birds or poultry, wear gloves and wash your hands when done. People may also wear a face mask and goggles if possible. In February, the avian flu was first detected in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, according to the US Department of Agriculture. This was the first case of infection in the US since 2020.

The case comes as the H5N1 bird influenza tears through the U.S., posing a low risk to humans while leading to the deaths of millions of birds. Some of the birds have died from the disease, but the vast majority of them are being culled to curb the spread. The patient, who is younger than 40, was involved in the culling of presumptively infected poultry at a commercial farm in Colorado's Montrose County, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. He is an inmate at a state correctional facility in Delta County and was working with poultry as part of a pre-release employment program. Members of the response team were all given personal protective equipment while working on the farm, and the affected flock has been euthanized. The patient has since recovered after reporting fatigue that lasted a few days as his only symptom. He was treated with oseltamivir, an antiviral influenza medication commonly sold under the Tamiflu brand. The virus was detected on a single nasal specimen and could have been present in the patient's nose without causing infection, according to a statement from Colorado authorities. This case marks the second human case associated with this group of H5 viruses—the first case occurred in the U.K. in December 2021, according to the CDC.

The unidentified person had direct contact with poultry and was working to destroy birds believed to have a version of H5N1 bird flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday. The person's only symptom was fatigue, the agency said. An earlier case in December in the U.K. was in an asymptomatic person who also had contact with infected birds. The CDC said it believes the risk to the general public is low. It said it is possible that the positive test was the result of surface contamination. Other people also involved in the same bird-destroying operation in Colorado have tested negative but are being retested out of caution, the CDC said. Health authorities are on guard because this strain has hit tens of millions of birds, from commercial flocks to wild birds, in at least 34 states. The rapidly spreading bird flu, the worst in seven years, has killed at least 11 million egg-laying chickens among other birds and driven up U.S. egg prices.

The man who tested positive for bird flu was an inmate at a state correctional facility in Delta County who was exposed to infected birds while working at a commercial farm in Montrose County, Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment said. He reported only one symptom of fatigue and recovered after a few days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Outbreaks of avian influenza have killed wild birds including dozens of bald eagles and lead to death through sickness or culling of tens of millions of poultry raised for meat and eggs in recent months. 'It spreads very quickly in poultry, makes poultry very sick, and can be lethal,' said Troy Sutton, an assistant professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Pennsylvania State University. The high transmissibility of this version of H5N1 among poultry and the increase in cases from late 2021 into this year had raised concerns among officials and disease experts of potential exposure to humans in the U.S., Dr. Sutton said. The risk to most people remains low, the CDC said on Thursday, but the agency advised people who work in proximity to infected birds to take extra precautions including wearing gloves, medical face masks and goggles. People in close contact with infected birds can be exposed to the virus through a bird's saliva, mucus and feces. 'When there is human infection with these viruses, often it can be severe,' said Richard Webby, member of the department of infectious diseases at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. 'The case fatality rate is much higher with this virus than it is for a typical seasonal, human influenza infection.' Among over 800 detected human cases of H5N1 globally from 2003 to March 2022, the case fatality rate was 53%, according to the World Health Organization. Most deaths associated with H5N1 viruses were caused by severe pneumonia and a collapse of the respiratory system, Dr. Webby said. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the risk of avian influenza spreading more widely to humans are low but not zero.

{"id": "148", "title": "First recent US case of human bird flu confirmed in Colorado", "date": "2022-04-29", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Colorado prison inmate has become the first person in the U.S. to test positive for bird flu in a recent outbreak that has led to the deaths of millions of chickens and turkeys, but federal officials say they still see little threat to the general public. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday evening that the infected man had been in a prerelease program and was helping to remove chickens from an infected farm. The man, who was under age 40, reported fatigue for a few days but has recovered, state health and CDC officials said in a statement. The man was isolated and is being treated with an antiviral drug. Other people involved in the bird removal operation in Colorado have tested negative, but they are being retested out of an abundance of caution. The man was part of a crew of inmates nearing release who had been working at the farm before a case of bird flu was confirmed there on April 19, said Lisa Wiley, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Corrections. When bird flu was detected at the farm in Montrose County, the inmates were asked to help kill and remove the birds. Agriculture officials have reported an outbreak at one Montrose County farm with 58,000 broiler breeder chickens. Despite the infection, the CDC considers the threat to the general public to be low because spread of the virus to people requires close contact with an infected bird. Signals that could raise the public health risk might include multiple reports of virus infections in people from exposure to birds, or identification of spread from one person to another. The CDC also is monitoring for genetic changes to the H5N1 bird flu virus that is currently circulating. Any genetic changes could indicate the virus is adapting to spread more readily from birds to people or other mammals. Many different bird flu viruses have infected humans worldwide since at least the 1990s, but health officials still say human infection is uncommon. In 2002, H7N2 caused pinkeye and mild respiratory symptoms in people in the U.K. and the U.S. Four U.S. infections have been identified since 2002; two were transmitted from cats to humans in 2016. More than 1,500 people in China have been infected with the H7N9 strain, largely in outbreaks between 2013 and 2017. This version caused serious infections among people and 40% of those who were hospitalized died. A different variant of H5N1 has also circulated since 1997, infecting more than 880 people, and it had a 50% case fatality rate. The current H5N1 variant has been spreading among backyard and commercial chicken and turkey flocks in the U.S. since late February. Viruses have been found in U.S. commercial and backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states. More than 35 million chickens and turkeys have been killed and removed to avoid spread, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported. The CDC said it has tracked the health of more than 2,500 people who have been exposed to H5N1-infected birds but that the inmate's illness was the only confirmed case to date. The agency said it was possible the man only had the virus present in his nose and that his body was not infected. Colorado public health officials say repeat testing on the man was negative for influenza. A nasal swab positive test result meets the agency's criteria for considering it an infection. The appropriate public health response at this time is to assume this is an infection and take actions to contain and treat, the CDC statement said. ___ Associated Press reporter Colleen Slevin in Denver contributed to this report.

{"id": "149", "title": "A bird flu that has devastated poultry flocks causes first human case in the U.S.", "date": "2022-04-29", "fulltext": "A type of the bird flu that has led to outbreaks in poultry in 30 states has been found in a person in Colorado, federal officials announced on Thursday. The case is the first known human infection of the bird flu currently spreading in the United States. The person had been working to destroy birds believed to have H5N1 bird flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The patient, who wasn't identified, reported feeling fatigued for a few days and has since recovered, the agency said. It said that the positive test might have been caused by surface contamination, but that the proper response was to assume that the person had been infected by a bird. Unlike the coronavirus, which has caused a global pandemic, scientists believe there is little risk of H5N1 spreading widely to humans. \"This case does not change the human risk assessment for the general public, which C.D.C. considers to be low,\" the agency said in a statement. Eating properly handled and cooked birds and eggs remains safe, it added. People whose work brings them in close contact with infected birds should be on alert, as they are at higher risk of infection, the C.D.C. said. The United States is in the midst of its worst bird flu season since 2015, when approximately 50 million chickens and turkeys had to be killed because of H5N2. The outbreaks that began in late 2021 were caused by the H5N1 virus, which has spread to 30 states and has led to the loss of 35.5 million birds as of Thursday, according to the Agriculture Department. Iowa has been hit the hardest, with the loss of about 13 million birds. Nebraska has lost about 5 million, and Pennsylvania about 4 million. The C.D.C. said that it was tracking the health of more than 2,500 people who have been exposed to H5N1-infected birds, and that it was retesting others who were involved in the same operation in Colorado as the infected person and previously tested negative for the virus. This is the second human case linked to this global outbreak of H5N1, experts said. In December, a person in Britain, who also had contact with infected birds, became infected but was asymptomatic. Infections of humans are rare, scientists said, but can happen when they are exposed to enough flu virus. Birds who are infected discharge the virus in their saliva, mucus and feces, putting people in close contact with them at risk. C.D.C. guidelines advise people who must handle birds, especially sick or dead poultry, to wear gloves, face masks and goggles. The current version of H5N1 is different from earlier H5N1 viruses that have led to more than 880 confirmed human infections since 2003 worldwide, the C.D.C. said.

{"id": "150", "title": "CDC reports first human H5 bird flu infection in U.S.", "date": "2022-04-29", "fulltext": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced late Thursday that a person in Colorado has tested positive for an H5 bird flu virus—the first such recorded infection in the United States. The CDC did not reveal the neuraminidase subtype of the virus—the N portion of an influenza A virus's name. The country is currently experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in both wild birds and in commercial poultry flocks. Authorities in Colorado are monitoring the health of about 10 people who were in contact with a man who tested positive for H5 bird flu when he was involved in culling poultry infected with the virus. The man, who is incarcerated at a state correctional facility and was taking part in a pre-release work program, is being considered the country’s first case of H5 bird flu. The people being monitored worked with him and shared transportation to the poultry operation. State Epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy said Friday that all the individuals have tested twice for the virus and all tests have been negative so far. They were all offered the flu antiviral Tamiflu, which can be used both to treat and prevent flu infections, though Herlihy wasn’t certain all had agreed to take it. They will be monitored for 10 days after their last exposure to the unidentified man, who she said had recovered from a very mild illness. “We’re being cautious,” Herlihy told STAT. “We’re using isolation, we’re using treatment, we’re monitoring contacts doing all of those things. But we continue to believe that the risk overall is low.” In reality, it’s not clear the man was infected. Workers who were culling the birds underwent daily symptom checks; on April 20, they were tested using nose swabs. On April 26, the state’s public health laboratory concluded the man had been infected with an influenza A virus, but it was unable to subtype the virus. The sample was then sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which confirmed on April 27 that the swab contained H5 virus. The subtyping of the neuraminidase—the N in the virus’s name—is still underway, but the presumption is that the birds and the man were infected with H5N1 viruses. The man was placed in isolation on April 26, after the state laboratory could not subtype the virus, Lisa Wiley, a public affairs officer for the Colorado Department of Corrections, said in an email. The move was taken out of an abundance of caution, she said. In interviews with public health officials after the fact, the man acknowledged feeling fatigued for a few days around the time the test was taken. But he reported none of the respiratory symptoms normally associated with flu. In a statement issued by the CDC on Thursday evening, the agency raised the possibility that the man may not have been infected—the swab may have just picked up the virus in his nostrils. But the positive test means he meets the definition of a case, the CDC said. “There’s some additional work that CDC can do, but we might not ever know if this was truly an infection or not,” said Herlihy. For years countries have been on high alert for H5N1 infections in people. In the mid-aughts, these viruses—labeled as highly pathogenic, because of their lethality to poultry—spread from Southeast Asia to South Asia and North Africa, leaving devastation in their wake. Millions of birds died from the virus or from the culling needed to stop the virus’s spread. And occasionally the virus jumped from poultry to people. In the past 20 years or so, roughly 880 people in 19 countries have been infected with H5N1. Just over half of them died. Fortunately, though, the virus to date has not acquired the capacity to spread easily from person to person and the fears that an H5N1 pandemic might be looming have faded. This case is unlikely to reignite them. The virus has changed over time, Todd Davis, who leads the CDC influenza division’s zoonotic virus team, said in an interview. The H5N1 viruses from 15 years ago or so had some different genes that appeared to allow them to trigger more severe illness when they infected people, he said. Those changes, particularly in the polymerase gene, are not present in most current day H5N1 viruses. And while the virus is still called H5N1, at a point a few years back it swapped genes with another flu virus, picking up a different neuraminidase. The new N1 is highly adapted to infect wild birds—speeding its recent spread through Europe, Africa and North America—but it seems less able now to infect people, Davis said. Since that reassortment event, the newly configured H5N1 has only been seen to have infected two people—a man in the United Kingdom last December and the man in Colorado. The U.K. man kept poultry and the virus found its way into his flock. Though he tested positive, he experienced no symptoms. “There have only been two detected human cases since the virus was first detected in 2018,” Davis said. “That’s also pretty good evidence that this virus is just not as capable of infecting or causing disease in humans.” Still, flu viruses change constantly, and public health officials do not take lightly human infections with non-human flu viruses. “Our challenge at the moment is trying to keep up with those hundreds of people who are involved in culling operations or disinfection of infected farms, and making sure that we don’t see any changes in the virus that might increase the propensity for severe illness or transmissibility,” Davis said. “We’re still very much on high alert.”", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "yes", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, stating that just over half of the roughly 880 people infected with H5N1 in the past 20 years have died.

{"id": "153", "title": "Worried about bird flu? Here's what it is, what to know about its symptoms", "date": "2022-04-29", "fulltext": "The worst avian flu outbreak in years is ripping through the United States, leading to the deaths of more than 24 million birds. The H5N1 virus has ravaged commercial and backyard poultry in 29 states, with nearly 250 outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control. American consumers have felt the bird flu in the form of higher egg prices, which more than doubled in March. But on Thursday, the CDC reported the first human case of the current dominant bird flu virus in the United States. An inmate in Colorado contracted the flu after exposure while working at a poultry farm. Still, public health officials say the risk of transmission in the general public is low. Bird flu's economic impact: Worst bird flu in years drives up egg prices, prompts precautions against spread to humans What is the bird flu? The bird flu, also known as the avian flu, refers to the disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted between birds. The dominant virus strain circulating currently is called H5N1. It is extremely contagious among birds, who spread it by shedding the virus in their saliva, feces and through nasal secretions. The virus originates in wild birds, but can spread to domesticated birds and lead to rapid, massive outbreaks. Avian influenza viruses are classified into two groups: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high death rates in infected birds, according to the CDC. Bird Flu symptoms in humans While possible, avian flu virus infections in humans are considered rare. The human infection reported in Colorado is only the second confirmed human infection of the present outbreak in the world. The first confirmed infection was reported in December in a United Kingdom man who had ducks living inside his home. He presented no symptoms. The man infected in Colorado showed mild symptoms of fatigue and was given antiviral medication for treatment. In China, officials confirmed the infection of a 4-year-old boy with a different strain, H3N8, after he reported a fever. Chinese health officials said his close contacts tested negative and that the strain posed little threat of widespread. Bird flu symptoms have been reported to be largely the same as the seasonal flu. Symptoms can include cough, a sore throat, head and muscle aches, fatigue and shortness of breath. Severe infections can lead to pneumonia that requires hospitalizations. Sometimes infection can cause a fever. Less common symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization reported that 863 H5N1 cases have been confirmed globally in 18 countries since 2003, causing 455 deaths. But the H5N1 virus in circulation now is different from prior versions, the CDC said, and the risk posed by bird flu to the public's health is still low. Human to human transmission is rare. Even when people have been infected with bird flu viruses there has rarely been onward spread from one infected person to another person, the CDC website reads. Most people who become infected become so after close, prolonged and unprotected contact with infected birds. Bird Flu prevention The best personal bird flu prevention is steering clear of prolonged exposure to birds. For those who work in close contact with poultry, hunt, or keep birds of their own, the CDC recommends implementing extra precautions like wearing gloves, mask and eye protection.

{"id": "154", "title": "US egg factory roasts alive 5.3m chickens in avian flu cull �hen fires almost every worker", "date": "2022-04-30", "fulltext": "Laborers worked for a month disposing of birds killed in a gruesomely inhumane manner. Then they found they too were disposable. Labourers at one of the world's largest egg factories arrived at the plant in Rembrandt, Iowa, early one morning in March to discover they were about to work themselves out of a job. As they gathered at the huge barns housing stacks of caged hens, the workers were told to forget about their usual routine of collecting eggs and feeding the birds. Overnight, the factory had begun slaughtering more than 5 million chickens using a gruesome killing method after detecting a single case of avian influenza. Even supervisors were assigned to the arduous task of dragging dead hens out of packed cages as Rembrandt Enterprises raced to contain the spread of the virus, amid the largest bird flu outbreak in the US in seven years. The culling has been repeated at chicken and turkey farms across Iowa and 28 other states from Maine to Utah. More than 22m birds have been killed in an attempt to contain the outbreak, the majority in Iowa, the US's biggest producer of eggs. The slaughter of 5.3m hens at Rembrandt is the largest culling at any factory farm in the country. Workers spent nearly a month pulling the dead poultry from the cages and dumping them in carts before they were piled high in nearby fields and buried in huge pits. The killing over, about 250 people were summarily thrown out of work with just a few dozen skeleton staff remaining. In the weeks that followed, animal rights protesters targeted Rembrandt's billionaire owner, Glen Taylor, over the cull, including disrupting games played by the professional basketball team he owns, the Minnesota Timberwolves. But few voices have been raised in support of Rembrandt's workers, some of them undocumented migrants. Others fired from the plant contrast the seriousness with which the bird flu outbreak has been taken by Rembrandt's management to what they describe as the company's lax approach to the threat to workers from Covid, as it swept through factory farms and slaughterhouses in Iowa and elsewhere. 'Right now everybody's worried about the chickens,' said Oscar Garcia, a former supervisor at the plant. 'We get it: it was really inhumane the way they killed them. But chickens are chickens, right? People worked in those barns pulling out dead birds in terrible conditions, faeces everywhere, doing 12- or 14-hour days. They couldn't protest because then they'd be fired and lose their redundancy pay. Then they're thrown out of work and no one speaks for them.' Outside criticism of Rembrandt has focused on the method of killing. Chicken farms have previously slaughtered hens en masse by suffocating them with foam or pumping barns full of carbon dioxide, methods that have been criticized as inhumane. But Tom Cullen of the Iowa newspaper the Storm Lake Times revealed that birds at Rembrandt were culled using a system known as ventilation shutdown plus (VSD+) in which air is closed off to the barns and heat pumped in until the temperature rises above 104F (40C). 'They cooked those birds alive,' said one of the Rembrandt workers involved in the culling. An animal rights group, Animal Outlook, used freedom of information laws to obtain records of experiments at North Carolina State University that show that VSD+ causes 'extreme suffering' to the hens as they 'writhe, gasp, pant, stagger and even throw themselves against the walls of their confinement in a desperate attempt to escape.' 'Eventually the birds collapse and, finally, die from heat and suffocation,' the group said. Members of another group, Direct Action Everywhere, have disrupted Timberwolves games in recent weeks wearing T-shirts proclaiming 'Glen Taylor Roasts Animals Alive.' James Roth, director of the Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University's college of veterinary medicine and an adviser to the federal government on biosecurity, acknowledged that VSD+ causes more suffering than other forms of culling, but said it is the most efficient means of containing the spread of bird flu because it is relatively swift. 'Nobody wants to see it used, but sometimes it is, as a last resort. The rationale is if the influenza virus spreads so fast that it'll go through a poultry house really rapidly, all of those birds produce massive amounts of virus in the air. Then you have a big plume of virus coming from that house that spreads to other poultry houses. It's critical to get the birds euthanised before that virus becomes a huge plume of virus to spread,' he said. Roth said that the authorities appear to have learned important lessons from 2015, when a bird flu outbreak resulted in what the US agriculture department calls 'the largest poultry health disaster in US history' with the slaughter of about 50 million chickens and turkeys. This time federal regulators moved quickly to contain the outbreak by shutting down the movement of workers between poultry flocks, a significant cause of the spread of avian flu in 2015. But Roth said this year the virus appears to have arrived in the US carried by waterfowl from Europe and to be better adapted to be spread by wild birds, which are harder to contain. That prompted the USDA to press for a swift culling at infected poultry farms. On 17 March, Rembrandt notified its supervisors that avian flu had been detected on the site. 'They sent out email at 10.30pm letting us know they had a confirmed case,' said a former Rembrandt worker who was obliged to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to receive redundancy payments. When the worker arrived the next day he discovered the company had already begun slaughtering millions of chickens. 'Once they're dead, we had to take them out by hand one by one, put them in a wheelbarrow. That's really intense manual labour. They are not very big cages. Twelve chickens are crammed in there. Awful conditions,' he said. 'After it was over, we were told to attend a meeting. We walked in. There was a big stack of yellow envelopes. That's like showing a knife to a chicken. You know what's going to happen next. We worked ourselves out of a job. I saw people who had years and years of experience just being let go. It was totally unexpected.' Some workers thought the layoff might be temporary, as it was during the 2015 outbreak. But they were given redundancy payments and told to find other jobs, suggesting the move was permanent and raising questions about the future of the plant. Some of the skilled former workers have had little trouble finding another job. Others have struggled. 'I'm just rushing to find a job in order to support my family,' said a former Rembrandt employee with several years at the company. Those struggling include undocumented workers who, Garcia said, were hired indirectly through third-party contractors. In February, the Storm Lake Times reported that a lawsuit by the family of a Guatemalan migrant worker who was crushed to death when cages collapsed on him revealed that he had been working under a false name through a subcontractor. Garcia also contrasted the seriousness with which Rembrandt took bird flu to the company's handling of Covid-19 as it surged in Iowa, particularly among labourers working close together on factory farms and in slaughterhouses. He said Rembrandt appeared to care more about avian flu outbreaks than Covid. He criticised the management for failing to require workers to wear a mask or to be vaccinated. 'They actually liked the fact that we didn't require our employees to get vaccinated, because they were hoping we would get employees from the surrounding areas that were requiring their employees to get vaccinated. They're using it almost as a recruitment tool,' he said. Other workers said that when they contracted Covid, they were obliged to use the days off they had earned as holidays instead of being given sick days. 'It's a company that makes millions of dollars. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that it doesn't care about people,' said Garcia.

The unnamed prisoner contracted the infection during a work release assignment at a farm in Montrose county where workers were euthanising an infected flock, the Colorado department of public health and environment said. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the health risk to the general public remained low. The patient reported fatigue for a few days as their only symptom and has since recovered, the agency said, adding that the man, who was younger than 40, was treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir. The Colorado case does not change the human health risk assessment the CDC said. The agency has tracked the health of more than 2,500 people with exposures to H5N1 virus-infected birds and this is the only case that has been found to date. Other people involved in the culling operation in Colorado have tested negative for H5 virus infection, but they are being retested out of an abundance of caution. The only other known human case of the strain of bird flu currently predominant was in the UK in December last year, the CDC noted, although almost 900 cases have been reported worldwide from earlier H5N1 viruses since 2003. The US agriculture department has been tracking the spread of avian influenza across 30 states and affecting more than 35 million birds, according to its latest figures. The Guardian reported on Thursday that more than 22 million birds have been killed in an attempt to contain the outbreak, the majority in Iowa, the biggest US producer of eggs. That figure didn’t include a commercial egg farm in Knox, Nebraska where 2.1 million poultry were reported affected on Wednesday. At one egg factory in Rembrandt, Iowa, about 250 employees were fired after roasting alive 5.3 million chickens, the largest cull at any factory farm in the country, in circumstances some fired workers and animal rights groups say were inhumane.

{"id": "157", "title": "Bird flu takes unheard-of toll on bald eagles, other birds", "date": "2022-05-05", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) Bird flu is killing an alarming number of bald eagles and other wild birds, with many sick birds arriving at rehabilitation centers unsteady on their talons and unable to fly. It's quite a sight to see an eagle with a six-foot wingspan having uncontrollable seizures because of highly pathogenic avian influenza, said Victoria Hall, executive director of the University of Minnesota's Raptor Center. At that point, they're so far into the disease there's no treatment options left. The latest outbreak of the highly contagious virus has led to the culling of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in U.S. farms since February, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed 956 cases of bird flu in wild birds, including at least 54 bald eagles. But the actual number is likely significantly higher because not every wild bird that dies is tested and the federal tally doesn't include cases recorded by wildlife rehabilitation centers. The latest reported toll is nearly 10 times higher than the 99 confirmed cases in wild birds during the last bird flu outbreak in 2015. This time, the virus has been detected in birds in 34 states, indicating it is far more widespread than seven years ago. The U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center also collects data from wildlife officials on suspected and confirmed bird flu deaths. It lists 8,536 recent wild bird deaths from avian influenza. This is definitely an unprecedented event, said researcher Rebecca Poulson, who has been studying avian influenza for 15 years at the University of Georgia's Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study. The number of birds and species and states already in which it has been detected is pretty alarming. Water fowl including ducks and geese, which typically carry the virus, and the raptors and scavengers that feed on them are the most commonly sickened birds, but cases have been confirmed in more than three dozen species. Ducks and geese are usually able to live with the virus without getting sick, but latest variant is proving more contagious and more deadly. We are seeing a tremendous impact from this virus, said Hall, whose Raptor Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, treats roughly 1,000 birds a year. We are seeing birds coming in suffering from this virus every single day. Nearly 61% of the 188 birds the rehabilitation center has tested since late March have had bird flu and all but one of those died. Hall said the center had to set up an area where workers wearing protective gear test sick and injured birds for avian influenza and quarantine them before bringing them into the center, to avoid infecting other birds. None of the 114 positive cases the center has recorded, including 28 bald eagles, are included in the USDA count, Hall said. She said a great horned owl recovered from the virus, giving her hope that some wild birds may be able to fight it off. USDA officials haven't responded to questions about why they are excluding the data from rehabilitation centers. Scientists estimated in a study published three years ago that the number of wild birds in North America had fallen by nearly 3 billion since 1970 as humans continue to encroach on their habitat. But it's too soon to know what impact the bird flu will have on bird populations because the outbreak is ongoing and there hasn't been enough time to study it, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service veterinarian Samantha Gibbs, and other experts. We're quite concerned. I think that we're going to be watching very carefully what the mortality rates are throughout the spring and summer, Gibbs said. Gibbs and Poulson said they fear the virus could survive the summer, when it usually dies off, leading to fall infections when migratory birds return south. That happened in Europe, where the virus is circulating first. Bald eagles, the U.S. national symbol since the 1700s, are among America's most celebrated conservation success stories. With an estimated 300,000 bald eagles in the country today, a population that quadrupled between 2009 and 2021, the bird was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species List in 2007. Given that, experts believe the species should weather the impact of this virus. State and federal officials will track the success of nesting eagles this spring and summer to gauge the impact of the virus. In Georgia, where three bald eagles that died tested positive for bird flu, the state Department of Natural Resources has documented a sharp drop in bald eagle reproduction this year in six coastal counties where many migratory birds spend the winter. Fewer than half of the 73 nests found there produced offspring, while nests elsewhere in the state had a success rate close to the average of 78% recorded in recent years. Some experts, including Hall, suggest that residential bird feeders should be removed to avoid further spread of the virus, but the USDA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service haven't recommended that because bird flu isn't common among the songbirds that frequent backyards. Still, they say it's important to regularly clean bird feeders to help limit the spread of other diseases. Wild birds could use all the help they can get right now, Hall said. When the virus is found on poultry farms, officials slaughter entire flocks to curb the spread, even when most birds have no symptoms. So far, 37.36 million birds have been killed in 32 states. USDA officials stress that bird flu doesn't jeopardize food safety because infected birds aren't allowed to enter the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses or bacteria. Health officials also say bird flu doesn't represent a significant health risk to people, even though one human case of the disease was confirmed in Colorado last month. Officials say people are unlikely to catch the virus unless they have prolonged direct exposure to infected birds. ___ Associated Press writers Carrie Antlfinger in Milwaukee and Doug Glass in Minneapolis contributed to this story.

{"id": "158", "title": "Avian flu confirmed in 2 backyard Pacific Northwest flocks", "date": "2022-05-06", "fulltext": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — An avian flu that's spreading quickly across the U.S. has been detected in the Pacific Northwest in two backyard bird flocks in rural Oregon and Washington. Several geese in a noncommercial flock of about 100 waterfowl died suddenly on a farm in Linn County, Oregon, and federal authorities confirmed Friday that they died of the avian flu. It was the state's first case since 2015. Also Friday, authorities in Washington state received word that chickens and turkeys in a flock of about 50 birds at a noncommercial farm in Pacific County, Washington, also had the disease. All the birds in both states were euthanized Friday and the farms were put under quarantine. The latest outbreak of avian flu hit North America in December and has led to the culling of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in U.S. farms since February. More than 35 million birds in flocks across 30 states have been affected. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed 956 cases of bird flu in wild birds, including at least 54 bald eagles. But the actual number is likely significantly higher because not every wild bird that dies is tested and the federal tally doesn’t include cases recorded by wildlife rehabilitation centers. The discovery of the avian flu in the Pacific Northwest wasn’t unexpected as the virus has been spreading rapidly across the country in both domestic and wild birds, particularly waterfowl. The virus seems to be spreading as wild birds migrate north along the Pacific Flyway and sometimes those birds stop to rest amidst domestic flocks, said Dana Dobbs, a veterinarian with Washington state. An infected bald eagle was found in British Columbia, Canada, in early March, said Dr. Ryan Scholz, Oregon's state veterinarian. “The long and the short of it is the producer noticed that one day a crow flew in with some of his chickens and the next day, he literally described that they were dropping like flies,” he said. “We want to contain and eradicate this disease as soon as possible to protect our commercial poultry industry as well as some of our backyard flocks that are selling eggs and doing things like that.” The cases do not pose a risk to humans, and birds from the farms were not used for food. Wildlife authorities in the Pacific Northwest said Friday that the virus seems to primarily affect waterfowl, but people who feed songbirds should take extra steps to clean their feeders frequently out of an abundance of caution. There are no detections of the avian flu in commercial poultry in either state, state agriculture officials said Friday.

{"id": "159", "title": "Canadian poultry farmers fearful of avian flu strain", "date": "2022-05-06", "fulltext": "CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Canadian poultry farmers are facing fear and stress as a highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 avian influenza is currently circulating in both wild and domestic flocks across North America. According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency poultry and egg producers in Canada have lost more than 1.7 million birds to avian influenza since late 2021. That tally includes both birds that have died of the virus and birds that have been euthanized. David Hyink, an Alberta chicken farmer, checks his barns each day with a sense of trepidation. He knows if the disease were to turn up on his property, it would mean the loss of his entire flock. Avian influenza has a high mortality rate, and those birds at outbreak sites that don’t die from the disease are humanely euthanized to prevent the spread of the virus. “While we haven’t had it on our farm, and I hope we don’t, it just appears it could be anybody,” Hyink said. “It could be us next, the farm next to us, you just don’t know.” Alberta is Canada’s hardest hit province with 900,000 birds dead and 23 farms affected. Ontario is the second hardest hit with 23 affected farms and 425,000 birds dead. Outbreaks of the virus have turned up now in every province except Prince Edward Island. Across the country, farmers are being encouraged to keep birds indoors, restrict visitors and ramp up biosecurity measures to help halt the spread. The virus can be spread between birds through direct contact, but it also spreads easily from wild bird droppings and can be carried into commercial flocks on the feet of workers or on equipment. While avian influenza was first detected in Canada in 2004, this year’s strain—which has also been wreaking havoc in Europe and Asia—is “unprecedented” in terms of its global impact, according to the CFIA. The new strain is highly transmissible and appears to be sustaining itself within wild bird populations. While there’s some hope that case counts might decline when the spring bird migration ends in June, for now, farmers are left wondering where and when the next outbreak will happen. “You just don’t know, and you do the best you can,” Hyink said. While farmers who lose flocks to avian influenza are eligible for government compensation, the disease has still caused significant disruption for industry, said Jean-Michel Laurin, chief executive of the Canadian Poultry and Egg Processors Council. Laurin said consumers have not been affected by any shortages, as the Canadian supply chain as a whole for eggs and poultry is holding up well. Part of the reason for that, he said, is that unlike in the U.S. — where massive industrial scale barns are much more common, meaning an outbreak at one property can take out an enormous amount of supply — Canadian chicken barns tend to be smaller, family run operations.

{"id": "160", "title": "Bird flu strikes chickens on farms in Md., Del.", "date": "2022-05-07", "fulltext": "Roughly 3.2 million confirmed cases of the bird flu have been found in chickens at six farms in Maryland and Delaware over the past two months, agriculture officials said Friday, part of a broader problem with the virus that is quietly sweeping across the country. Eighty black vultures in Maryland's Harford County also were recently found dead from the highly pathogenic avian influenza, officials said, near wildlife areas along the Susquehanna River. Maryland and Delaware agriculture authorities said they have had reports of chickens at the farms being infected with the bird flu since February. The vultures were found in the past two weeks. Thirty-seven million chickens and turkeys have been culled on U.S. farms since February because of the latest outbreak, according to the Agriculture Department, and roughly 950 cases of bird flu have been found in wild birds, including at least 54 bald eagles. In Virginia, officials said they detected bird flu in February among a 'backyard flock' of roughly 90 turkeys, chickens and ducks in Fauquier County. There has been no bird flu detected in D.C., officials said. 'The numbers are just staggering in terms of the poultry,' said Charlie Broaddus, the state veterinarian in Virginia. One of the biggest factors in the bird flu's spread this year, he said, is that it's being carried by wild ducks and geese that are infected but 'don't typically become affected' by it. 'They're carriers,' Broaddus said, 'but the genetic sequence has the potential to make domestic birds much, much sicker.' Broaddus said the larger farms that have hens producing eggs that 'end up in the supermarket' tend to be large-scale operations, where the flu can spread quickly. Sometimes, he said, chickens at farms become infected when a farmer or worker 'accidentally tracks through goose droppings near a pond' and then brings it into the chicken facility. 'It takes just one to be infected before they spread it to others,' Broaddus said. Many wild birds don't always show signs of the virus, but it can be easily transmitted between birds through their droppings or through respiratory secretions, experts said. Agricultural officials at the Delaware-Maryland HPAI Joint Information Center said they were concerned about the vultures, because they're scavengers and 'if they eat a bird infected with avian influenza, whether it's a migratory bird such as a Canadian goose, other waterfowl, or another vulture, they will ingest the virus and then can get sick and die.' 'We want to ensure they are taking steps to stop the spread of the virus so that they don't inadvertently transport it to other areas heavily populated with wild birds,' said Stacey Hofmann, a spokeswoman for the joint command center. Officials with the command centers in Maryland and Virginia said they have response teams to quickly 'take action' to try to stop the spread of the bird flu and are encouraging farmers to be 'proactive in ensuring vultures do not stop at their farms.' The high number of black vultures found in the wild in Harford County is particularly alarming to some experts, because it means the birds are spreading the virus as they're eating carcasses. 'That's a lot of vultures to get the bird flu at once,' said Dan Rauch, the wildlife biologist for the District. 'Vultures travel to where their food sources are, so they're moving all over the place. 'They feed together and roost together, so that allows this highly pathogenic disease to spread quickly,' he said. The birds then 'shed the virus through their saliva, mucus and feces.' 'It gets into the community and sticks around,' Rauch said. 'It's not good.' Agriculture experts at the joint command center in Maryland and Delaware advised the public to 'help limit the spread of the disease by not moving bird droppings via their shoes to other wild-bird habitats.' People should also change their shoes and clean off dirty shoes after they've visited a wild or natural area. Experts said 'spraying the bottoms of your shoes with a common household cleaner such as Lysol or a dilute bleach spray will kill the avian influenza virus,' a command center statement said. For those with pet birds or poultry at home, officials recommend you 'wash your hands, change clothes, and clean your shoes after visiting areas where wild birds frequent.'", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "One of the biggest factors in the bird flu's spread this year, he said, is that it's being carried by wild ducks and geese that are infected but 'don't typically become affected' by it.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "'They're carriers,' Broaddus said, 'but the genetic sequence has the potential to make domestic birds much, much sicker.'", "affirm_transmissible_statement_3": "'It takes just one to be infected before they spread it to others,' Broaddus said.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_6": "'We want to ensure they are taking steps to stop the spread of the virus so that they don't inadvertently transport it to other areas heavily populated with wild birds,' said Stacey Hofmann, a spokeswoman for the joint command center.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_8": "'Vultures travel to where their food sources are, so they're moving all over the place.

The outbreaks have led zoos to temporarily close aviary exhibits and move birds away from the public. As we have reported, vets and animal advocates have called for restrictions on 'cruel' methods of culling birds using extreme heat and steam. A giant leap in global food prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has helped three members of the super-rich Cargill family, who majority-own one of the world's largest food companies, join the ranks of the world's 500 richest people. Scientists have uncovered evidence that dangerous versions of superbugs can spread from pigs to humans. The discovery, made in Denmark, underlines fears that intensive use of antibiotics on farms is leading to the spread of microbes resistant to them. The Clostridioides difficile superbug infects the human gut and is resistant to all but three antibiotics in use today. An increase in the use of feedlots as opposed to grass-fed production in Brazilian beef production is being driven by China, according to reports. China buys about 50% of Brazil's exported beef. Meanwhile, Uruguay's beef production could hit record levels this year. A merino sheep named Shrekapo who grew an enormous fleece while evading capture in New Zealand is now 18.6kg lighter after its first shave. Shrekapo was spotted hiding in the rocks, and was caught later that day, carrying nearly half its bodyweight in wool. The animal had probably been roaming the hills alone for the past three winters. UK news The UK's free-range egg sector is on the brink of collapse because of sharply rising costs, the British Free Range Egg Producers Association has warned. In a recent poll, more than 70% of members said they would quit if price rises were not forthcoming. Meanwhile, an estimated 10% of the UK's pig breeding herd has gone, as the National Pig Association (NPA) warned of significant gaps between the costs and pig prices. British food producers warned that perishable goods were losing their value due to congestion around the port of Dover caused by disruption to ferry services and customs operations. Fresh meat has reportedly been stranded for one to two days and possibly longer due to the current problems. One of the UK's biggest food retailers has warned chicken could soon cost as much as beef as production costs soar. Steve Murrells, chief executive of the Co-op, said that feed costs had become a huge challenge for the poultry industry. Welfare campaigners now fear the cost of living crisis could stall the campaign to phase out the faster-growing broiler breeds associated with higher mortality, lameness and muscle disease than slower-growing breeds. A vet whistleblower has been awarded a £1.25m payout after losing her job at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) when she raised concerns over meat traceability in Northern Ireland. She had also highlighted serious breaches of animal welfare legislation within the meat supply chain, the Belfast Telegraph reported. The number of documented violations of legislation designed to reduce water pollution caused by agriculture in England has hit record levels as the rules remain largely unenforced. Last year had the highest number of recorded violations of the farming rules for water since the legislation was introduced in April 2018. From the Animals Farmed series An H3N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, in China's central province of Henan. The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China's National Health Commission. Northern Ireland will need to lose more than 1 million sheep and cattle to meet its new legally binding climate emissions targets. The large-scale reduction in farm animals comes after the passing of the jurisdiction's first ever climate act, requiring the farming sector to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Organic dairy, for so long the sector's success story, is facing a crisis of confidence, with fears about whether people will keep buying organic milk, butter and cheese as food prices soar. Some UK organic farmers are being paid a milk price that is lower than the price some of their non-organic competitors get. A loophole in government regulations meant that chickens could still be called free-range even though they were no longer allowed outside because of repeated outbreaks of bird flu across the UK. The ban on birds being allowed outdoors was lifted at the beginning of May. And in the US, Charlie Hope-D'nieri and photographer Danny Wilcox Frazier have reported on how factory pig farms are hollowing out rural communities in the state of Iowa.

{"id": "163", "title": "Will bird flu and inflation send diners flocking to plant-based meat alternatives?", "date": "2022-05-11", "fulltext": "Consumers flipped over the notion of hamburgers made from plants instead of animals when the alternatives showed up in supermarkets and fast-food chains about five years ago. But with prices for meat replacements high and America's taste for real beef intact, shoppers steered away even as the plant-based meat-alternative industry slogged away with new products, better distribution and the opening of new international markets. Now, plant-based product makers could be poised to get their sizzle back. Inflation is raising prices of beef and other meats faster than for plant-based alternatives. Plus, price hikes related to an avian flu outbreak that has spread to flocks in 34 states could tempt more consumers to try the newfangled meat and poultry replacements. If those inducements aren't enough, there are the more traditional selling points: The new protein alternatives are more ecological because growing plants isn't as rough on the environment as raising farm animals. The substitutes are healthier since plant-based foods lack artery-clogging cholesterol. 'If we can get more people to incorporate plant-based meat into their diet, it's a win for them, it's a win for us, it's a win for the planet,' said Peter McGuinness, CEO of Impossible Foods, a leading maker of plant-based meats. The timing could be right. In April, fresh beef and chicken prices had both risen more than 9% over the previous year. By contrast, meat alternatives were down 1.6%, 210 Analytics reported. But showing just how far they will need to go, the alternatives averaged $8.15 a pound, almost twice the average price of ground beef. The problem: Market penetration lags Still, there's hope. At a Ralphs, a Kroger supermarket brand in Southern California, a four-pack of Impossible's plant-based bratwurst was selling on promotion for $5.99 this week instead of the usual $8.99. A 12-pack of Johnsonville pork brats, however, was priced at $8.99, discounted from the normal $12.99. Inflation is having an outsize impact on meat prices, 'further narrowing that price gap to plant-based foods,' said Rachel Dreskin, CEO of the Plant Based Foods Association and Institute. 'Plant-based is no longer a niche. This is a full-fledged industry, and the moment for plant-based is now.' The nationwide bird flu outbreak could continue to increase poultry prices, tempting shoppers even further. Farmers have had to kill more than 25 million chickens, turkeys and other livestock fowl to try to head off an avian flu outbreak so vicious that it is felling bald eagles in the wild. Prices for poultry items are estimated to increase by at least 6% this year, according to the USDA's food price outlook. The market holds nothing but upside for plant-based meat manufacturers. Their products make up just 1.5% of meat sales, and only about 1 in 5 consumers purchase plant-based meat at retail, reports Caroline Bushnell, a vice president for the Good Food Institute, nonprofit advancing alternative proteins. By contrast, the plant-based milk industry has reached 42% of households and has a 16% share of the liquid milk category. Besides the price differential, Bushnell said potential consumers were put off by the fear they wouldn't like the taste of meat substitutes. But that's exactly where the new high-tech makers of plant-based meats think they can score if only consumers will give them a try. Impossible and its archrival, Beyond Meat, have introduced sausages, meatballs and chicken nuggets or tenders that they believe have, because of technology, the texture, fatty taste and sizzle of real meats. Beyond has even tried jerky. Beyond Meat, however, has been flame-broiling its investors. Its stock sank more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday after it missed sales estimates for the first three months of the year. It had a net loss of $100.5 million over the quarter. Impossible is privately held. McGuinness, who took over recently as CEO after leaving yogurt maker Chobani, said in an interview that his goal was to quadruple the number of locations selling Impossible's products to 100,000. The solution: Innovate and cut costs To do it, he said he's going to direct marketing at 'the masses,' not just high-end consumers who aren't as resistant to paying more for a plant-based product. And McGuinness said the messaging will go much further. 'The value proposition isn't just price and price alone,' he said. 'Our products are better for you health-wise and they're tasting as good or better than animal products.' Both Impossible and Beyond tout having made past price cuts. McGuinness said the major impediment to lowering prices further is scale. Higher sales and more production could help achieve economies of scale that cut prices further. Since he plans to grow the brand, McGuinness believes prices will fall further. The growth will be helped by the introduction of still more innovative products.

(AP) Additional cases of bird flu have been confirmed with the most recent in Whatcom and Okanogan counties, Washington state agricultural officials said Friday. The cases were confirmed Thursday in non-commercial backyard flocks, the state Department of Agriculture said in a statement. Flock owners contacted the state's sick bird hotline to report an unusual number of sudden deaths and sickness in their flocks. The flocks, one with around 100 chickens and the other with nearly 30 chicken, ducks, and geese, are quarantined and will be euthanized, the statement said. Cases of avian flu were also confirmed in backyard flocks in Spokane County earlier this week and last week in Pacific County. Agriculture Department spokesperson Amber Betts said other cases also have been confirmed in Pierce and Clallam counties. The latest outbreak of avian flu hit North America in December and has led to the culling of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in U.S. farms since February. More than 35 million birds in flocks across 30 states have been affected. State officials say reducing or eliminating contact between wild birds and domestic flocks is a key way to protect domestic birds from bird flu. Bird owners should bring their flocks inside or undercover to protect them from wild waterfowl, officials said.

{"id": "167", "title": "Conspiracy theorists flock to bird flu, spreading falsehoods", "date": "2022-05-17", "fulltext": "Brad Moline, a fourth-generation Iowa turkey farmer, saw this happen before. In 2015, a virulent avian flu outbreak nearly wiped out his flock. Barns once filled with chattering birds were suddenly silent. Employees were anguished by having to kill sickened animals. The family business, started in 1924, was at serious risk. His business recovered, but now the virus is back, again imperiling the nation's poultry farms. And this time, there's another pernicious force at work: a potent wave of misinformation that claims the bird flu isn't real. 'You just want to beat your head against the wall,' Moline said of the Facebook groups in which people insist the flu is fake or, maybe, a bioweapon. 'I understand the frustration with how COVID was handled. I understand the lack of trust in the media today. I get it. But this is real.' While it poses little risk to humans, the global outbreak has led farmers to cull millions of birds and threatens to add to already rising food prices. It's also spawning fantastical claims similar to the ones that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring how conspiracy theories often emerge at times of uncertainty, and how the internet and a deepening distrust of science and institutions fuel their spread. The claims can be found on obscure online message boards and major platforms like Twitter. Some versions claim the flu is fake, a hoax being used to justify reducing the supply of birds in an effort to drive up food prices, either to wreck the global economy or force people into vegetarianism. 'There is no bird flu outbreak,' wrote one man on Reddit. 'It's just Covid for chickens.' Other posters insist the flu is real, but that it was genetically engineered as a weapon, possibly intended to touch off a new round of COVID-style lockdowns. A version of the story popular in India posits that 5G cell towers are somehow to blame for the virus. As evidence, many of those claiming that the flu is fake note that animal health authorities monitoring the outbreak are using some of the same technology used to test for COVID-19. 'They're testing the animals for bird flu with PCR tests. That should give you a clue as to what's going on,' wrote one Twitter user, in a post that's been liked and retweeted thousands of times. In truth, PCR tests have been used routinely in medicine, biology and even law enforcement for decades; their creator won a Nobel Prize in 1993. The reality of the outbreak is far more mundane, if no less devastating to birds and people who depend on them for their livelihood. Farmers in states like Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota have already culled millions of fowl to prevent the outbreak from spreading. Zoos around the U.S. have moved exotic bird exhibits indoors to protect their animals, and wildlife authorities are discouraging backyard bird feeding in some states to prevent the spread by wild birds. The disease has also claimed bald eagles around the country. The first known human case of the H5N1 outbreak in the U.S. was confirmed last month in Colorado in a prison inmate who had been assisting with culling and disposing of poultry at a local farm. Most human cases involve direct contact with infected birds, meaning the risk to a broad population is low, but experts around the country are monitoring the virus closely just to be sure, according to Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, an agency that tracks animal disease in part to protect the state's agricultural industries. 'I can guarantee you, this is the real deal,' Poulsen told The Associated Press. 'We certainly aren't making this up.' Poultry farms drive the local economy in some parts of Wisconsin, Poulsen said, adding that a devastating outbreak of avian flu could create real hardships for farmers as well as consumers. While the details may vary, the conspiracy theories about avian flu all speak to a distrust of authority and institutions, and a suspicion that millions of doctors, scientists, veterinarians, journalists and elected officials around the world can no longer be trusted. 'Americans clearly understand that the federal government and major media have lied to them repeatedly, and are completely corrupted by the pharmaceutical companies,' said Dr. Joseph Mercola, an osteopath whose discredited claims about vaccines, masks and the coronavirus made him a prominent source of COVID-19 misinformation. Mercola's interest in the bird flu dates back years. A 2006 book for sale on his website, which Mercola uses to sell unproven natural health remedies, is titled 'The Great Bird Flu Hoax.' Polls show trust in many American institutions, including the news media, has fallen in recent years. Trust in science and scientific experts is also down, and along partisan lines. Moline, the Iowa turkey farmer, said he sympathizes with people who question what they read about viruses, given the last two years and bitter debates about masks, vaccines and lockdowns. But he said anyone who doubts the existence or seriousness of the avian flu doesn't understand the threat. The 2015 outbreak was later determined to be the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. Moline's farm had to cull tens of thousands of turkeys after the flu got into one of his barns. Workers at the farm now abide by a hygiene policy meant to limit the spread of viruses, including using different pairs of boots and clothes for different barns. Conspiracy theories are bound to flourish during times of social unrest or unease, according to John Jackson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. Before the internet, there were likely just as many people who privately doubted explanations for big events, Jackson said. But they enjoyed limited opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals, few chances to win new converts, and no way to broadcast their views to strangers. Now, the conspiracy theories that gain wide popularity, such as the QAnon movement or discredited claims about COVID-19, work because they give believers a sense of control in a rapidly changing, interconnected world, Jackson said. While they can emerge after disasters, assassinations or plane crashes, they can also appear during times of social upheaval or rapid change. 'There isn't a phenomena on the planet, whether it's the avian flu or 5G, that isn't already primed for conspiracists,' Jackson said. 'Now we have coronavirus, which has traumatized us so profoundly... we look at this same idea of bird flu with completely new eyes, and we bring different kinds of conspiracy to it.' Claims that the avian flu is a hoax used to drive up food prices also highlight real-world concerns about inflation and food shortages. Worries that the flu is somehow linked to 5G towers underscore anxieties about technological change. Suggestions that it will be used to mandate vegetarianism, on the other hand, reflect uncertainties about sustainable agriculture, climate change and animal welfare. By creating explanations, conspiracy theories can offer the believer a sense of power or control, Jackson said. But he said they also defy common sense in their cinematic fantasies about vast, sprawling conspiracies of millions working with clockwork efficiency to undermine human affairs. 'Conspiracy theories rest on the idea that humans have the capacity for keeping secrets,' Jackson said.

{"id": "168", "title": "State asks live poultry sales to end because of bird flu", "date": "2022-05-19", "fulltext": "SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — With bird flu hitting nine flocks scattered across seven counties, the Washington state Department of Agriculture on Thursday requested that live market poultry sales cease for the next 30 days. The closure is not mandatory. Confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 have shown up in nine small backyard flocks in Thurston, Pierce, Pacific, Clallam, Spokane, Whatcom and Okanogan counties since May 5, the agency said. Dr. Amber Itle, the Washington state veterinarian, said bird flu has been reported in 35 states this year. “We are one of the last states to get hit,” she said during a news conference. All nine infected locations consisted of backyard flocks with substantial exposure to wild waterfowl. No commercial flocks have been infected. Commercial poultry products remain safe to consume, the agency said. Itle said the bird flu does not appear to have human health risks at this time, and is unlikely to impact dogs, cats or other pets. But she cautioned pet owners to keep their animals away from dead birds. Markets that choose to continue bird sales risk disease transmission, state officials said. If a case of HPAI were detected in connection with a market, there would be significant impacts. The market would face thorough animal tracing and extensive cleaning and disinfection requirements, officials said. WSDA has reached out to all markets that have live sales of birds and advised them to stop sales. Some markets had already voluntarily stopped selling birds even before receiving the advice from the state veterinarian. “Temporarily suspending poultry and waterfowl sales is recommended until detections across Washington slow down. This may extend until the end of June,” Itle said. For markets that choose to remain open, Itle made several recommendations to reduce the risk of transmitting disease, including increasing biosecurity measures, only selling birds destined for slaughter, prohibiting birds with signs of illness, keeping birds in transport containers and not comingling. So far, the infected flocks have been relatively small, backyard flocks. “Stopping these sales protects not only these backyard flocks but small and large commercial flocks as well,” Itle said. “It is all about reducing risk.

{"id": "169", "title": "Why unprecedented bird flu outbreaks sweeping the world are concerning scientists", "date": "2022-05-26", "fulltext": "Mass infections in wild birds pose a significant risk to vulnerable species, are hard to contain and increase the opportunity for the virus to spill over into people. A highly infectious and deadly strain of avian influenza virus has infected tens of millions of poultry birds across Europe, Asia, Africa and North America. But scientists are particularly concerned about the unprecedented spread in wild birds. Outbreaks pose a significant risk to vulnerable species, are hard to contain and increase the opportunity for the virus to spill over into people. Since October, the H5N1 strain has caused nearly 3,000 outbreaks in poultry in dozens of countries. More than 77 million birds have been culled to curb the spread of the virus, which almost always causes severe disease or death in chickens. Another 400,000 non-poultry birds, such as wild birds, have also died in 2,600 outbreaks, twice the number reported during the last major wave, in 2016-17. Researchers say that the virus seems to be spreading in wild birds more easily than ever before, making outbreaks particularly hard to contain. Wild birds help to transport the virus around the world, with their migration patterns determining when and where it will spread next. Regions in Asia and Europe will probably continue to see large outbreaks, and infections could creep into currently unaffected continents such as South America and Australia. Although people can catch the virus, infections are uncommon. Only two cases have been reported since October, one each in the United Kingdom and the United States. But scientists are concerned that the high levels of virus circulating in bird populations mean that there are more opportunities for spillover into people. Avian influenza viruses change slowly over time, but the right mutation could make them more transmissible in people and other species, says Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organization (WHO)-collaborating influenza centre at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia. \"These viruses are like ticking time bombs,\" he says. \"Occasional infections are not an issue but the gradual gaining of function of these viruses is what is the real concern,\" he says. Virus origin The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain emerged in commercial geese in Asia in around 1996, and spread in poultry throughout Europe and Africa in the early 2000s. By 2005, the strain was causing mass deaths in wild birds, first in East Asia and then in Europe. Since then, the strain has repeatedly infected wild birds in many parts of the world, says Andy Ramey, a research wildlife geneticist at the US Geological Survey Alaska Science Center in Anchorage. Through repeated spillovers, Ramey says, H5N1 seems to have become more adapted to wild birds. It's now become an emerging wildlife disease, he says. In 2014, a new highly pathogenic H5 lineage called 2.3.4.4 emerged and started infecting wild birds without always killing them. This created opportunities for the virus to spread to North America for the first time. The lineage has since dominated outbreaks around the world, including the current ones. The virus affects some wild bird species more severely than others. For instance, some infected mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) show no signs of disease, whereas the virus killed roughly 10% of the breeding population of barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard late last year and hundreds of Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus) in Greece earlier this year. Wildlife researchers are trying to understand why the virus affects species differently. They are particularly concerned about the virus's impact on vulnerable bird species with smaller populations or restricted geographic ranges, and species that are particularly susceptible to infection, such as whooping cranes (Grus americana) and emperor geese (Anser canagicus), Ramey says. Ramey adds that only a fraction of cases in wild birds are diagnosed and reported. More monitoring could unveil the true magnitude of wild bird mortality, he says. Controlling the spread Better monitoring of infected wild birds could also help to alert poultry facilities to the risk of future outbreaks. Although regions with large poultry or migratory bird populations are at high risk of further outbreaks no matter how good their surveillance is, says Keith Hamilton, head of the department for preparedness and resilience at the World Organisation for Animal Health. Tracking disease in wild birds is resource-intensive and challenging owing to the sheer size of their populations, Hamilton says. He suggests targeted surveillance in areas more likely to encounter the virus, such as popular flyways or breeding grounds. An effective vaccine for poultry could help to stem the spread, along with decreases in the number of birds in production facilities, says Michelle Wille, a wild-bird virologist at the University of Sydney in Australia. The poultry industry can also continue to improve biosecurity by restricting entry to facilities, protecting their water sources and decreasing contact between poultry and wild birds. Although poultry populations can be culled to stop the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, researchers emphasize that wild birds should not be harmed to mitigate outbreaks. Killing wild birds to prevent further infections would not work because of the huge size and vast ranges of their populations, says Lina Awada, a veterinary epidemiologist at the World Organisation for Animal Health. It could even make the situation worse, because it would disrupt wild-bird movements and behaviours, helping the virus spread further, she says. \"The same way we shouldn't be shooting bats because of coronavirus, the solution to this is not trying to kill wild birds,\" Wille says. Researchers say that what is needed is a holistic approach that considers how avian influenza spreads through wild birds, poultry and people. Collaboration between public-health researchers and animal-health groups is vital for picking up spillover events into people. \"If we control this in poultry, we control this in humans, and it's likely that we control this in wild birds, as well,\" Wille says.", "media_outlet": "Nature", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "But scientists are concerned that the high levels of virus circulating in bird populations mean that there are more opportunities for spillover into people.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "Avian influenza viruses change slowly over time, but the right mutation could make them more transmissible in people and other species, says Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organization (WHO)-collaborating influenza centre at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_3": "\"These viruses are like ticking time bombs,\" he says. \"Occasional infections are not an issue but the gradual gaining of function of these viruses is what is the real concern,\" he says.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 3, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Mass infections in wild birds pose a significant risk to vulnerable species, are hard to contain and increase the opportunity for the virus to spill over into people.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Researchers say that the virus seems to be spreading in wild birds more easily than ever before, making outbreaks particularly hard to contain.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "Wild birds help to transport the virus around the world, with their migration patterns determining when and where it will spread next.", "affirm_why_statement_4": "Scientists are concerned that the high levels of virus circulating in bird populations mean that there are more opportunities for spillover into people.", "affirm_why_statement_5": "Avian influenza viruses change slowly over time, but the right mutation could make them more transmissible in people and other species.", "affirm_why_statement_6": "Through repeated spillovers, H5N1 seems to have become more adapted to wild birds.

The beach was littered with dead and dying birds: male eider ducks, several species of gulls, a gannet, a puffin and no fewer than 26 pink-footed geese, which should by now have been on the way back to their Icelandic breeding grounds. In all, Stronach recorded 72 individual birds of 17 species at Loch Fleet national nature reserve on the east coast of Scotland on that one day, plus many more in the following days. But these birds had not been killed by a passing predator; nor were they the hapless victims of a sudden storm at sea. The cause of these deaths was a highly infectious—and for birds, usually lethal—virus. Avian influenza H5N1 or, as it is more commonly known, bird flu, is back with a vengeance. What really worries Stronach is the range of species he found. Earlier this spring, we noticed that avian flu was restricted to the geese; but since then it has spread to other wildfowl, raptors and seabirds. In previous years, it mainly occurred in winter; now, he says, it is affecting the breeding populations of iconic coastal species such as the eider. Elsewhere in Scotland earlier this month about 20 great skuas were found dead or dying on Fair Isle, with more reported from other breeding colonies on the Shetland Isles. This followed a serious outbreak of bird flu in 2021, when hundreds of skuas died. For any species, these deaths are a serious setback, especially at the height of the breeding season. But for great skuas and pink-footed geese, this news is especially troubling. Scotland hosts 60% of the global breeding population of great skuas, and 90% of the world population of pink-footed geese overwinter in the UK. For these two species, both of which are on the amber list of birds of conservation concern, bird flu could pose a serious threat to their long-term future. Bird flu is by no means confined to the UK. In December 2021, an outbreak in the Hula valley, in northern Israel, killed more than 5,000 cranes out of a wintering population of 30,000 birds. In what the Israeli government called 'the deadliest wildlife disaster in the nation's history' workers wearing hazmat suits were photographed collecting the corpses. After the outbreak, farmers were instructed to slaughter hundreds of thousands of chickens. In Canada, a deadly strain of bird flu has already ravaged the poultry industry, resulting in almost 2 million chickens being killed. Now it has transferred not only to wild birds but mammals too. While the disease is usually confined to waterbirds, this particular strain has attacked crows, jays, gulls, raptors and even young foxes. The US is suffering what looks to become the worst ever outbreak of bird flu—which farmers are blaming on transmission from wild birds. More than 37 million chickens and turkeys have so far been culled, with more to come. If just one bird tests positive, the farmers must destroy the entire flock. As one report noted: 'In Wisconsin, lines of dump trucks have taken days to collect masses of bird carcasses and pile them in unused fields. Neighbours live with the stench of the decaying birds.' Even the bald eagle, America's national bird, has been affected. Could it also affect humans? The answer is, in very rare cases, yes—usually those, such as farmworkers, who have been in close and prolonged contact with infected domesticated birds. From 2003 to 2021, almost 500 people around the world died after catching the virus. Clearly, bird flu is something we need to take seriously. But Stronach is concerned that the current monitoring and surveillance system is designed to protect commercial poultry firms, and is not really adequate for wild bird populations. 'We need urgent research to find out what other species it is found in, and, crucially, the mechanisms by which it is spreading,' he says. He is especially concerned that if dead birds are not collected after an outbreak, they may be scavenged by buzzards, red kites, gulls and skuas, thus spreading the disease even faster. Anyone who finds a dead or dying wild bird, which they suspect might have the disease, should not touch the corpse; nor should they attempt to rescue it if it is still alive.

{"id": "171", "title": "Hormel Says Bird Flu to Squeeze Turkey Supply; Minnesota company says it expects to be short on turkeys, while customer demand remains high", "date": "2022-06-02", "fulltext": "The rapidly spreading avian influenza outbreak in the U.S. that has led to the death of nearly 40 million birds is squeezing Hormel Foods Corp.'s turkey flocks, as meat prices hit their highest levels in years. The Austin, Minn.-based maker of Spam said its Jennie-O turkey brand faces an uncertain period as the bird flu outbreak is expected to continue to weigh on industrywide poultry supplies. Jennie-O Turkey Store sales volumes are expected to decline about 30% in the second half of the year due to supply gaps, Hormel Chief Financial Officer Jacinth Smiley said on a call with analysts. Hormel on Thursday cut the high end of its earnings outlook for the year as it faces the impact of the bird flu, higher feed costs, rising transportation and labor expenses and Covid-19 restrictions in China. \"Our Jennie-O team went through a lot this quarter,\" Hormel Chief Executive James Snee said, adding that the virus was first detected in the company's supply chain in March. Hormel shares fell 5.5% in midday trading, with U.S. stock indexes slightly higher. The highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, the worst in seven years, has affected 36 states and led to the death of more than 5 million turkeys, according to the Agriculture Department. It has devastated egg-laying chicken flocks and sent the price of some poultry products, such as eggs, soaring in recent weeks. Turkey supplies already were tight before the outbreak, leading to some of the highest prices registered since the last bird flu outbreak in 2015, industry analysts said. Breast meat prices already have risen to levels higher than any point in 2015, trading around $6 a pound, and prices for other turkey products have increased as well, said Mr. Snee. Further flock losses could further increase prices, according to analysts. Though cases of avian influenza have slowed in May, they could pick back up as wild birds migrate south in the fall. This year's outbreak has largely been attributed to wild birds spreading the virus to farms as they migrate further north, agriculture industry officials have said, despite increased biosecurity since the outbreak in 2015 that led to the deaths of about 50 million birds. Biosecurity measures Hormel implemented since then have provided some protection against the virus, Mr. Snee said, and the number of company-managed turkeys impacted to date is 25% lower than the previous outbreak. Mr. Snee said that the company has started restocking farms and expects Hormel's turkey volumes to improve by the end of October, but to still be down compared with normal levels. Assuming no more outbreaks from this event or a recurrence in the fall, he said the company expects more-traditional volumes in the company's first quarter. Despite higher turkey meat prices, demand for Hormel's products remained strong for the quarter that ended May 1, company officials said. Consumers have shown signs of swapping some pricey meats, including beef, for cheaper products. Hormel reported higher sales and profit in its second quarter. Its Jennie-O brand posted a 387% rise in profit and officials noted strong demand from restaurants for its refrigerated foods products. Those businesses more than offset higher freight expenses and higher costs for certain items such as avocados, meat and packaging, said Mr. Snee. Staffing shortages and lower levels of cold storage capacity have left Hormel and other meat suppliers unable to meet customer demand, further lifting prices, industry officials have said. The company said feed prices are significantly higher, with corn and soybean meal prices up more than 125% and 40%, respectively, as of early May. High feed prices are expected to continue, company officials said, especially with farmers getting off to a late planting start this year due to cold and wet weather across the Midwest this spring. Overall, Hormel posted a profit of $261.6 million, or 48 cents a share, compared with $227.9 million, or 42 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected 47 cents a share. The company's sales rose 19% to $3.1 billion during the period, outpacing Wall Street expectations. Refrigerated foods sales were up 13% year over year thanks to higher pricing. Grocery products sales climbed 39%, largely due to Hormel's acquisition of the Planters nuts brand, which closed last year. Hormel's operating margin rose sequentially from the first quarter, as higher prices and other efforts offset the company's higher costs, executives said. The company said consumer demand remained robust despite higher prices. For the full year, Hormel now expects per-share earnings between $1.87 and $1.97, cutting the high end of its view by a nickel. The company maintained its sales guidance, projecting demand to remain strong.

{"id": "172", "title": "Georgia officials find bird flu strain in domesticated flock", "date": "2022-06-02", "fulltext": "VIDALIA, Ga. (AP) Officials have confirmed a highly contagious variety of bird flu in a backyard flock in southeast Georgia. Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black said Thursday it was the first confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in domesticated birds in Georgia this year. The Toombs County resident who kept the flock of chickens, turkeys, ducks, peafowl and other birds told WJBF-TV that dozens of his ducks died in a 24-hour period. He asked officials to investigate, and samples taken Monday confirmed the presence of bird flu. Officials killed more than 350 birds to prevent the spread of the disease and disinfected the farm. Georgia has the nation's largest poultry industry, and Black said that if bird flu spread to commercial operations, it would have a devastating impact on poultry farmers but also to the state's economy as a whole. Officials said Georgia was the 36th state where the H5N1 bird flu strain was found in domesticated birds, with tens of millions of birds affected. Before now, officials had only detected it in wild birds in Georgia. An earlier bird flu outbreak included a northwest Georgia chicken farm in 2017. Louise Zavala, executive director of the Georgia Poultry Laboratory, said officials are testing birds on all commercial poultry farms within 6 miles (10 kilometers). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says humans are at very low risk of contracting bird flu. One case was detected earlier this year in a Colorado state prisoner who was culling infected poultry. Infections in other countries sometimes happen among people who spend long periods unprotected around infected birds, the CDC says.

{"id": "173", "title": "US bird flu outbreak: millions of birds culled in most inhumane way available", "date": "2022-06-07", "fulltext": "Controversial killing method used in 73% of culls this year despite vets urging its use to be limited The US poultry industry has increasingly switched to 'the most inhumane method available' to cull tens of millions of birds during the latest outbreak of avian influenza, according to government data. Outbreaks of the disease, also known as bird flu, have wreaked havoc across Europe and the US this year, with 38 million birds killed in the US so far. But how these birds are killed has generated controversy, with veterinarians and animal welfare campaigners urging an end to the use of the ventilation shutdown method, which kills animals by sealing off the airflow to the poultry sheds and increasing temperatures to lethal levels. Workers have described the method as like 'roasting animals alive.' European officials have said it should not be used in the European Union. In the US, however, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) lists ventilation shutdown with supplemental heat as 'permitted in constrained circumstances' for 'depopulation.' A new analysis has found that it has now become the main method for killing birds, used in nearly three-quarters of culls. The analysis of US Department of Agriculture (USDA) data by the Animal Welfare Institute found 73% of culls in the US in February and March (the most recent period for which data is available) involved the use of ventilation shutdown. This represents a dramatic shift from the last bird flu epidemic, in 2015, which resulted in the killing of 50 million farmed birds in the US. During that outbreak, the animals were predominantly killed by carbon dioxide poisoning or smothered in a blanket of firefighting foam. 'The default method of killing seems to have changed from foam to ventilation shutdown,' said Dena Jones, director of the AWI farm animal programme, who said the design of poultry housing 'ensures they won't be able to humanely kill them.' A USDA spokesperson said 'some housing designs do not allow for effective depopulation using foam' and that the carbon dioxide method was 'hindered by supply shortages.' The department financially compensates farmers for culling animals. Activists have protested against the widespread use of ventilation shutdown, most notably by disrupting basketball games to draw attention to Glen Taylor, the billionaire owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves team who also owns an Iowa egg farm where 5.3 million hens were killed using ventilation shutdown. A coalition of vets and animal rights advocates have urged the AVMA to reclassify the method as 'not recommended.' The lack of response so far from the AVMA 'harms animals and the veterinary profession's reputation as caring advocates for animals,' according to Crystal Heath, a vet and co-founder of the ethical veterinary group Our Honor. In the EU and the UK, birds are culled with carbon dioxide gas or nitrogen-infused foam, which are considered to be more humane methods than using firefighting foam when carried out correctly because they render the animals unconscious before killing them, Jones said. The European Food Safety Authority says ventilation shutdown should not be used, but there have been reports of producers in France being given emergency permission to use it. The EU also considers the use of firefighting foam to kill birds as inhumane because it entails 'drowning in fluids or suffocation by occlusion of the airways.' The USDA did not respond to a question about whether any steps were being taken to require less painful cull methods or prevent ventilation shutdown from becoming the default in future outbreaks.", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Outbreaks of the disease, also known as bird flu, have wreaked havoc across Europe and the US this year, with 38 million birds killed in the US so far.", "affirm_why_count": 1, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "174", "title": "Bird flu arrives in Southwest after millions of birds die", "date": "2022-06-09", "fulltext": "PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona officials have confirmed the first cases in the Southwest of a bird flu that has led to the deaths of 37 million birds from commercial farms in the central and eastern U.S. The disease was spotted after tests by federal wildlife officials in three wild cormorants that had been found dead in a park in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale, Arizona Game and Fish officials announced this week. The disease has not yet been found in any domestic birds or in commercial operations, the agency said. But it is a concern, according to Glenn Hickman, president and CEO of Hickman Family Farms, one of the largest egg producers in the Southwest. Hickman operates four chicken ranches in Arizona, one in California and two in Colorado. The company has stopped any visits to its farms and double-checked its biosecurity program, which is designed to prevent its approximately 2 million chickens from being infected. Its chickens are kept in barns that are secured so that wild birds can't enter, and any people or tools that enter are disinfected. The company dodged a scare recently when the avian flu was found in a flock 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from one of its Colorado farms, Hickman said Thursday. And while he's concerned about the Scottsdale find, it's not anywhere near as concerning as if a nearby commercial operation had an outbreak. “Those are a lot scarier because the massive amount of virus that is potentially produced when you have a large population is much more than the relatively small amount of virus per bird in the wild bird population,” he said. None of his farms were affected. Arizona Game and Fish officials have been closely monitoring for the disease, which had been no closer than Colorado before this week's announcement, by responding to all calls of dead birds. Anne Justice-Allen, the department's wildlife veterinarian, said calls from the public alerted her agency to the dead cormorants, water-loving birds that often nest in groups. The three juveniles had fallen out of their nests and were spotted dead by morning walkers in the park, who called wildlife officials. “It's a good thing they did,” Justice-Allen said, because they were able to collect the birds and test them before park workers removed them. “We had a high suspicion that it was something that we do not normally see,” Justice-Allen said. “We have resident cormorants in the area, and we do not normally see mortality events in them.” Justice-Allen said a major concern is backyard flocks of chickens, which are allowed in parts of metro Phoenix. The disease has been found in many homeowner flocks across the country. Bird owners should watch for symptoms like birds not eating or lethargy, runny noses, seizures or diarrhea, she said. Anyone seeing those symptoms should call the state Department of Agriculture. The first U.S. detection of the new strain of highly contagious avian flu in domestic poultry was in February in Indiana. More than 37 million birds have been killed to prevent the infection from spreading since then. As of June 3, it had been detected in wild birds in 40 states, but not in California, Arizona, Nevada or New Mexico. Commercial flocks in 19 states have been infected. Once an infection is found, the birds won't recover and are killed to prevent spreading the illness, Justice-Allen said. The outbreak has not only killed domestic fowl. It has also had a heavy toll on bald eagles and other wild bird species, much more so than the nation's last bird flu outbreak detected in 2014. That outbreak cost more than 50 million domestic poultry. Hickman said egg producers are so far making up for lost production from outbreaks affecting flocks this year. “I think I can speak pretty firmly that regardless of how many birds that have been affected and depopulated, there are still eggs on every shelf in every grocery store in America,” Hickman said.

{"id": "175", "title": "Deadly bird flu found in ducks on the Mall in Washington", "date": "2022-06-09", "fulltext": "The virus that causes the deadly avian flu affecting millions of wild and domestic birds across the country has been detected in mallard ducklings in the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool on the Mall, the National Park Service said Wednesday. It was the first confirmation of the 'highly pathogenic avian influenza,' or HPAI, in Washington, the park service said. A 'die-off' of more than a dozen ducklings at the reflecting pool was discovered a few weeks ago, Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst said Wednesday. When the animals underwent necropsies, two were found to have been infected with bird flu. He said it was not yet clear what killed the others. The virus is rarely transmitted to humans. 'To date there has been only one documented human case of the currently circulating HPAI in the U.S.,' the Park Service said in a statement. 'We're not looking at another covid-type situation,' Litterst said. 'But because humans can unwittingly facilitate the transfer between groups of birds, we just want to get the word out there.' So far, 39 million birds have been affected in flocks in 36 states including 1.7 million in Maryland, 4 million in Pennsylvania and 1.4 million in Delaware, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Only 90 have been affected in Virginia. The current virus is believed to pose a low risk to the general public, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although 'some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection.' But people should avoid handling live or dead birds or coming into contact with their droppings as the virus can be easily moved around on shoes, the Park Service said. Visitors to the area should watch out for 'waterfowl feces,' and pets should be kept away from live or dead birds. People should report sick or dead birds to Park Service staff. The virus is highly contagious among some wild birds and can be deadly for bald eagles and vultures, the Park Service said. Mallards are less likely than many other waterfowl species to show signs of disease and can be infected without appearing sick. The term 'highly pathogenic' refers to the significant illness and mortality in poultry and other domestic birds that results from infection with this virus, the Park Service said. Elsewhere in the area, 80 black vultures in Maryland's Harford County were recently found dead due to the virus near wildlife areas along the Susquehanna River, officials have said. Vultures can be infected by scavenging infected dead birds. They were among about 950 cases in wild birds, including at least 54 bald eagles. Maryland and Delaware agriculture authorities said they have had reports of chickens at farms being infected with the bird flu since February. The vultures were found in recent weeks. 'The numbers are just staggering in terms of the poultry,' Charlie Broaddus, the state veterinarian in Virginia, said last month. One of the biggest factors in the bird flu's spread this year, he said, is that it's being carried by wild ducks and geese that are infected but 'don't typically become affected' by it. 'They're carriers,' Broaddus said, 'but the genetic sequence has the potential to make domestic birds much, much sicker.' Broaddus said the farms that have hens producing eggs that 'end up in the supermarket' tend to be large-scale operations, where the flu can spread quickly. Sometimes, he said, chickens at farms become infected when a farmer or worker 'accidentally tracks through goose droppings near a pond' and then brings it into the chicken facility. 'It takes just one to be infected before they spread it to others,' Broaddus said. Many wild birds don't always show signs of the virus, but it can easily be transmitted between birds through their droppings or through respiratory secretions, experts said. Agricultural officials at the Delaware-Maryland HPAI Joint Information Center said they were especially concerned about the vultures because they're scavengers, and 'if they eat a bird infected with avian influenza, whether it's a migratory bird such as a Canadian goose, other waterfowl, or another vulture, they will ingest the virus and then can get sick and die.' 'We want to ensure [that people] are taking steps to stop the spread of the virus so that they don't inadvertently transport it to other areas heavily populated with wild birds,' said Stacey Hofmann, a spokeswoman for the joint information center. Agriculture experts at the joint information center have advised the public to 'help limit the spread of the disease by not moving bird droppings via their shoes to other wild-bird habitats.' People should also change their shoes and clean off dirty shoes after they've visited a wild or natural area. Experts say that spraying shoe bottoms with a common household cleaner such as Lysol or a diluted bleach spray will kill the avian influenza virus, according to an information center statement. For those with pet birds or poultry at home, officials recommend they 'wash your hands, change clothes, and clean your shoes after visiting areas where wild birds frequent.'

The disease, also known as bird flu, has spread widely across the continent during the past two years, with the EU set to explore the potential of using vaccines to prevent the spread, rather than culling. Officials under former US president Donald Trump collaborated with the meatpacking industry to downplay the threat of Covid to plant workers and block public health measures that could have saved lives, a new investigation has found.

Germany has reported a new outbreak of the deadly pig disease African swine fever (ASF) on a farm more than 300 miles (480km) from where other cases have been registered and just four miles from the French border.

Researchers in China have reportedly developed a process to clone pigs entirely through the use of robots, a development that may help the world’s largest pork consumer reduce its reliance on imported breeding pigs. The largest lab-grown meat plant in Asia is to be built in Singapore, opening next year. The country became the first government to allow the sale of lab-grown meat in 2020 and the new factory will be built by the US company Eat Just. UK news A third of migrant workers on UK fishing vessels who responded to a survey work 20-hour shifts, and around one-third reported regular physical violence, according to a new study. A campaign group has urged councils to drop meat from school dinners at least two days a week, despite critics saying activists are ignoring evidence. Animal Rebellion claims to have persuaded one English council to agree to its demands, but Jeremy Miles, the education minister for Wales, insisted meat should always be on the menu. Reducing stocking densities for broilers too quickly could threaten supplies of home-produced chicken, Tesco’s agricultural manager has warned. John Kirkpatrick said a move to increase the space given to chickens could reduce the amount of British poultry produced, it was reported. The UK’s biggest cheesemaker is set to receive a large fine after it admitted pollution and odour charges. Dairy Crest, which is owned by the Canadian firm Saputo, and makes brands including Cathedral City, admitted 21 pollution incidents, which led to fish dying in the River Inny in Cornwall. From the Animals Farmed series Danish mink breeders have turned their backs on the industry en masse after being forced to cull their animals over fears a Covid-19 mutation could pose a risk to humans. In November 2020, Denmark announced it would cull approximately 15 million animals, with the government temporarily banning mink farming and breeding for fur until 2023. Iceland is under pressure to ban the production of a hormone extracted from pregnant horses, a practice that has been described as cruel and animal abuse. Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) is used by farmers in the UK and Europe to increase reproduction in pigs, cows and other female farm animals. Animal welfare campaigners visiting farms discovered broken restraint boxes and enclosures covered in bite marks, which they claimed was a sign of anxious horses. Consumers could be hit with higher egg prices as UK farmers reduce their flock numbers, in response to escalating costs and insufficient profit margins. The numbers of chicks being placed by egg producers in April was down 15% year on year, according to the latest government figures. The low price of wool is pushing farmers to opt for moulting sheep, with shearing now costing more than the wool is worth. Farmers are switching to breeds that shed their own fleeces, and wool is seen as an optional extra to the meat that brings in the bulk of their income. The US poultry industry has increasingly switched to the most inhumane method available to cull tens of millions of birds during the latest outbreak of avian influenza, according to government data. Outbreaks of the disease have led to 38 million birds being killed in the US so far this year.

{"id": "177", "title": "Michigan lifts poultry show ban imposed to control bird flu", "date": "2022-06-13", "fulltext": "LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan has lifted a statewide ban on poultry and waterfowl exhibitions after 30 days passed with no new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in domestic birds. Bird shows can resume in the state, Michigan's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said in a statement Monday. The state halted poultry and waterfowl exhibitions May 10 as a precaution to protect against the spread of bird flu among poultry flocks. The ban was lifted Saturday. Even though the state has been able to reach this incredibly important benchmark, this does not mean the virus has left Michigan, State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland said in the statement. HPAI continues to be detected in wild birds throughout the state, which is not unexpected as the virus is known to be carried by wild birds. Avian flu has been spreading across the U.S., prompting farms to euthanize millions of birds. It can spread be spread from flock to flock, including wild birds, and through contact with infected poultry, equipment and caretakers. When it banned the shows, the state said transporting poultry from different flocks to one location, such as a county fair, creates a significant risk. In 2015, avian flu prompted a similar ban on Michigan poultry shows, affecting nearly 4,000 youth who participate in poultry 4-H projects at county fairs throughout the state. The latest outbreak of avian flu hit North America in December and has led to the culling of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in U.S. farms since February. At least a dozen non-commercial backyard flocks in nine Michigan counties have been infected, impacting a total 870 birds, MLive.com reported earlier.

{"id": "178", "title": "Bird flu outbreak waning but threat of virus lingers", "date": "2022-06-16", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A bird flu outbreak in the U.S. that led to the deaths of more than 40 million chickens and turkeys and contributed to a spike in egg and meat prices appears to be waning, but experts caution the virus hasn't disappeared and worry another surge could take hold this fall. The number of birds culled to limit its spread dropped from a peak of almost 21 million in March to less than 800,000 in May. However, more than 2 million birds have been killed already this month after infections were discovered at two large farms in Colorado. “The numbers in the dashboard do tell a story, but we are not ready to say the outbreak is winding down,” said Richard Coker, a spokesman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service division of the Department of Agriculture. “We remain vigilant and encourage producers to continue to practice strong biosecurity.” Some state and industry officials are optimistic that the outbreak is ending, although no one is quite ready to relax. Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said the virus still poses a risk because more cases are being reported, but that “It really does feel like we're on the tail end of it for this year.” When a case of the highly pathogenic virus is found, officials kill the entire flock to limit its spread. The virus doesn't discriminate between backyard flocks and massive egg farms; flocks of all sizes have been infected. Iowa, the nation's leader in egg production, was by far the hardest hit state with 13.4 million birds lost. No cases have been reported in the state since May 4, likely because migrating wild birds, which are blamed for spreading the virus, have moved out of Iowa. Nebraska lost nearly 4.9 million birds, Pennsylvania lost 4.2 million and Colorado saw 3.6 million birds killed. Minnesota and Wisconsin each lost about 3 million. An outbreak in 2015, when 50 million turkeys and chickens were killed, remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The government spent nearly $1 billion then to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. The USDA has so far approved $793 million to cover costs this year. National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Beth Breeding said the government payments “keep those losses from being catastrophic,” but they don't cover everything. For example, farmers lose income because they can't raise birds while their properties are being disinfected. Food prices have increased 10% overall this year, exceeding the 8.6% inflation reported last month. Egg prices soared the most, jumping 32%, while poultry prices are up nearly 17%. But agricultural economists say that while the bird flu outbreak contributed, spikes in the cost of feed, fuel and labor are much bigger factors. It didn't help that the outbreak peaked just as demand for eggs was highest around Easter, driving prices higher. But a relatively small proportion of the nationwide flock was affected. The 40 million birds killed represent only 6% of the chickens raised to produce eggs, 2.5% of turkeys and less than 1% of the chickens raised for meat. Economists expect egg and meat prices to ease this summer as farms are able to build back their flocks. “I think that there is going to start being some relief,” said Jada Thompson, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. The summer heat should help kill off the disease, but experts worry that the latest version of the virus may be hardy enough to survive the season, leading to a new outbreak when wild birds migrate later in the year. “We may have an even bigger peak this year in the fall, who knows?” University of Georgia researcher David Stallknecht said. “The honest answer is that we do not know what the future holds, but the reporting decline in commercial poultry cases is encouraging.” The prospects for a bird flu vaccine are uncertain; foreign markets are reluctant to import meat from inoculated birds, and vaccination can hide the presence of the virus meaning farmers would have to spend more to increase testing of their flocks. And vaccinated birds can still fall sick, just like vaccinated humans. “I personally do not see vaccine as something that's going to be used in the United States,” said John Clifford, the former U.S. chief veterinary officer who oversaw the USDA response to the 2015 outbreak. “Countries that don't export may feel different. We can't afford to lose those markets.” There is only so much farmers can do to limit the spread of bird flu. Farmworkers already usually have to shower and change clothes before they enter a barn, and tools for each barn are kept separate. Emily Metz, CEO of the American Egg Board trade group, said some farmers have invested heavily in combatting the virus, including upgrading ventilation systems and installing laser light systems to ward off wild birds. “If it does linger or come back, we're prepared. We're not letting our guard down,” Metz said. “The improvements our producers have made in terms of biosecurity are part of their everyday business.” ___ Associated Press reporter David Pitt contributed to this report from Des Moines, Iowa.

{"id": "179", "title": "Not Just for the Birds: Avian Influenza Is Also Felling Wild Mammals", "date": "2022-06-18", "fulltext": "As a new version of bird flu spread through North America this spring, scientists began finding the virus in red foxes, bobcats and other mammals. Something was wrong with the foxes. That was what callers to the Dane County Humane Society in Wisconsin kept saying in April, as they reported fox kits, or young foxes, behaving in strange ways: shaking, seizing or struggling to stand. The kits, which were often lethargic and wandering by themselves, also seemed unusually easy to approach, showing little fear of humans. 'We just kept getting calls,' said Erin Lemley, a wildlife veterinary technician at the humane society's wildlife center. 'And the foxes started coming in.' Some of the kits that were admitted for treatment were quiet and withdrawn, she said. Others stumbled around or had seizures, their heads ticcing, their eyes flicking rhythmically. After the staff ruled out rabies, low blood sugar and other potential causes, laboratory testing revealed a surprising culprit: a highly virulent strain of avian influenza. 'It was not a fun surprise,' said Dr. Shawna Hawkins, a zoo and wildlife veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The virus, a type of bird flu known as Eurasian H5N1, has been spreading rapidly in the United States this spring, infecting flocks of farmed poultry in 36 states and prompting mass culls of domestic birds. But this version of the virus appears to be taking a much greater toll on wild birds than previous lineages have, finding its way into ducks, geese, gulls and terns, among many others. That, in turn, means that the virus poses an elevated danger to mammals that prey on those birds, including wild red foxes. At least seven U.S. states have detected the virus in red fox kits, to which the pathogen appeared to be particularly lethal. Two bobcats in Wisconsin, a coyote pup in Michigan and skunks in Canada have also tested positive for the virus, as have foxes, otters, a lynx, a polecat and a badger in Europe. (Two human cases, one in the United States and one in Britain, have been reported as well, both of which were in people who had close contact with birds.) There is no evidence that mammals play a significant role in spreading the virus, and the risk to humans remains low, experts said. 'This is very much still an avian virus,' said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. But evolution is a numbers game, he said, and the more mammals the virus infects, the more opportunities it has to pick up new mutations that could help it spread among foxes, bobcats or even humans. 'What it's going to take for this virus to transition from being a duck or a chicken virus to being a mammalian virus is more chances to replicate in those mammalian hosts,' Dr. Webby said. 'So that's why when we see these mammals being infected by this virus, we do take notice.' Twitching foxes The new lineage of the virus spread through Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia last year, sparking outbreaks in wild and domestic birds. It also showed up in a handful of wild mammals, including fox kits in the Netherlands in the spring of 2021. By the end of the year, the virus had made its way to North America. As it raced through the migrating American bird population this spring, reports began to emerge of infected fox kits first in Ontario and subsequently in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa, Alaska, Utah and New York. In some bird species, the virus caused obvious neurological symptoms, and many infected foxes displayed abnormal behaviors, too. They twitched, walked in circles and salivated excessively. In the most severe cases, the foxes developed seizures; death often followed shortly after, experts said. Post-mortem examinations revealed that many of the kits had pneumonia, said Dr. Betsy Elsmo, a diagnostic pathologist at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory who performed the necropsies. When she examined the animals' brain tissue under a microscope, Dr. Elsmo saw clear signs of damage. 'There was a lot of inflammation in the brain microscopically,' she said. 'The pattern of injury that I saw was consistent with a viral lesion.' So far, the virus appears to be taking a greater toll on fox kits than adult foxes, potentially because the young animals do not yet have fully developed immune systems, experts said. But the overall infection and mortality rate is unknown. 'We're just getting kind of anecdotal reports in nature right now,' said Michelle Carstensen, the wildlife health program supervisor for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Wisconsin officials also detected the virus in two adult bobcats this spring. 'Both bobcats showed reduced to no fear of humans,' Dr. Lindsey Long, wildlife veterinarian for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said in an email. 'They were noted sitting on porches and in close proximity to human activity without the usual fear response.' One bobcat seemed to be shivering, while the other appeared to be having trouble breathing, she added. The bobcats, which were euthanized, had microscopic brain lesions that were 'pretty much identical' to those in the affected foxes, Dr. Elsmo said. The virus was also recently detected in a coyote pup in Michigan, said Dr. Megan Moriarty, the wildlife veterinary specialist at the state's Department of Natural Resources. Scientists suspect that the animals are acquiring the virus by eating infected birds. In a laboratory study, researchers had previously demonstrated that red foxes that were fed infected bird carcasses could contract, and then shed, the virus. Although it is possible that the virus has evolved in ways that make it better at infecting mammals, scientists say that the most probable explanation for the sudden rise in infected mammals is that this lineage is infecting enormous numbers of wild birds, increasing the odds that hunters and scavengers might stumble across infected food sources. So far, the virus does not appear to be causing enough illness or death in wild mammals to put these species at risk, experts said. And there is no evidence of sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission. 'Mammals are generally considered to be dead-ends for highly pathogenic avian influenza,' Dr. Moriarty said. An early analysis of viral genomes from the Wisconsin fox kits suggests that the infections are essentially a series of one-offs — the result of individual foxes coming into contact with infected birds rather than foxes transmitting the virus to each other. 'The preliminary data that we have suggests that these are all independent spillover events,' Dr. Elsmo said. But much remains unknown, including whether the virus will establish itself in wild birds for the long haul, which could pose a sustained risk to mammals. And even isolated mammalian infections provide the virus with new opportunities to evolve. 'There's a risk of it adapting to and then transmitting between mammals, and then you have a new problem,' said Dr. Jolianne Rijks, a veterinarian at the Dutch Wildlife Health Center. Some state officials said that they had started more routinely testing sick mammals for the virus, especially ones with neurological symptoms. Animals that test positive should also have samples of their virus sequenced so scientists can monitor for any potentially worrisome changes, Dr. Webby said. Experts also encourage members of the public to report any wild animals that appear to be acting strangely. 'That's how all this started,' Dr. Elsmo said, 'as citizens seeing abnormally behaving kits and reporting them.' A rescued fox kit at the Dane County Humane Society.

{"id": "180", "title": "Bird flu is on the rise in the UK. Are chickens in the back garden to blame?", "date": "2022-06-19", "fulltext": "The risk to humans from the disease, spread by wild birds, is low but a record level of outbreaks this year has researchers worried. Bird flu outbreaks rose nearly fivefold last year, creating an urgent need for research into preventing the spread of the disease, according to the head of a new consortium investigating the virus. The record of 26 outbreaks involving H5N1 in 2021 has been shattered, with 121 outbreaks involving the H5 serotype this year, according to Prof Ian Brown, head of virology at the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha). This may be due to the growing number of people keeping chickens or ducks, Brown said. Many of these keepers do not have to register with any authority because of the small numbers of birds involved. A good percentage of our cases have been in those types of setting, Brown said. They're in big commercial farms all the way down to somebody keeping two chickens in their back yard. So that is a massive shift in terms of the food security risk, public health risk, animal welfare and poultry exports. The Apha consortium was established by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) at breakneck speed after last year's outbreaks caused alarm and disruption among poultry farmers, and the first case of bird flu infecting a human in the UK. Over the past 10 years, we've had several bird flu events in the UK, but their frequency has been increasing, Brown said. Instead of coming every three or four years, we seem to be getting an event every year, and they're on a bigger scale. The risk to humans remains very low. Since bird flu emerged 20 years ago, about 600 cases have been recorded worldwide, with no human-to-human transmission. But the Covid pandemic has underlined the risks posed by other potential zoonotic diseases—ones that are transmitted to people from animals. The more humans are in contact with birds in an uncontrolled way, the greater is the theoretical risk that people can get infected, Brown said, adding that the UK has very good surveillance of viruses. If we can reduce the burden in birds, that also has a beneficial effect in reducing the risk to humans. Bird flu spreads to farmed birds from wild ones, and researchers are examining data collected over last winter to discover which practices make farms less vulnerable to infection. When the last winter's wave began, the government ordered that all birds be kept indoors—known in agriculture as housing rather than lockdown—which meant that free-range eggs were unavailable in Britain for five weeks. The virus moves between birds through close contact: it's droplet transmission—a bit like Covid, Brown said. Faeces and nasal secretions—bird snot—are other vectors. Infectious droppings from wild birds as they fly over farms may be part of the problem. Even at 4C, the virus will quite happily survive, infectious, for about eight weeks, he added. Another area of research is how and why wild birds fall sick: the illness is very distressing for the animals and often fatal. Thousands of birds have died in Scotland, most of them gannets nesting in close-knit colonies, as well as gulls and puffins. This is a concern because some of these are threatened species and defenceless against the virus. When these birds come to breed in summer, they get really close together. So it snowballs through these colonies. Wild bird migration is probably another factor, and some of the greatest mixing occurs in central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan, on an avian version of the Silk Road. The virus usually disappears from Europe in summer but this did not happen last year. It also reached North America for only the second time.

Along the strand, a succession of small bedraggled forms lie prone victims of the avian flu ripping through the seabird populations of the Northern Isles and up the east coast of Britain. Crossing over to the Brough of Birsay, the tidal island, via a narrow causeway, I stumble across the first gannet. Its long, streamlined body is immediately recognisable: spectre white, misted with gold at its crown. Its eyes, staring blindly, have that piercing, icy quality of a husky, while its beak is the palest powder blue lined in black, as if designed with a felt-tip pen. It is unusual to be able to admire such a creature at close quarters, but I keep my distance. Best not to touch it. There's a second bird just a few metres further on, this one sprawled across the strand, wings outstretched. A pitiful sight. It's the same story all up the coast, affecting many species at once. Last year it was the geese. This year: the gannets, guillemots, great skuas, and more. A catastrophe in our midst, and one with global significance: at this time of year, Scotland plays host to 46% of the world's northern gannets and 60% of all great skuas. There is horrifying footage from the famous gannet colonies at Hermaness in Shetland, where more than 1,000 dead birds have been recorded in the waters, and the Bass Rock off East Lothian, the largest such colony in the world show scenes of devastation. Birds slide from their rocky perches, hang lodged in crags while their close neighbours continue to feed and fledge their chicks amid the corpses. This annual gathering, where birds feed and fledge their young collectively and in close proximity, is serving as a superspreader event.

{"id": "183", "title": "Bird exhibitions return in Iowa as avian flu subsides", "date": "2022-06-27", "fulltext": "SLOAN, Iowa (AP) — All spring, Addy Johnson feared a repeat of 2015, when the poultry barn at the Woodbury County Fair featured none of her feathered friends. “I’d go in there and look at the rabbits and the other side was empty and it was sad,” Addy said. Avian influenza, or bird flu, had swept the state, forcing commercial producers to destroy millions of chickens and turkeys. To contain the spread of the deadly virus, poultry and bird shows across Iowa were canceled. Addy and younger sister Brenna faced a repeat of that sad situation this year. Bird flu again hit Iowa in March, eventually being confirmed at 19 sites, including seven in Northwest Iowa, and forcing producers to destroy hundreds of thousands of birds. On March 23, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship canceled all live bird exhibitions at fairs. “It was weird. I had like an empty feeling,” Addy told the Sioux City Journal. She and Brenna already were raising dove and golden pheasant chicks on their rural Sloan acreage for their 4-H projects. It looked like they wouldn’t get the fun of showing them at the fair. “I was sad,” Brenna said. “Our hope was to wait and pray we would have one (a show).” On June 3, those prayers were answered. The state lifted the show ban after more than 30 days had passed since a new confirmed bird flu infection. The girls, both members of the Willow Workers 4-H Club, found out a couple days later at a 4-H awards banquet. (Nebraska also has lifted a similar bird show ban.) Addy and Brenna, who also show rabbits, horses and dogs at the fair and enter a number of other non-animal projects, will once again have a packed fair schedule, either showing their animals each day or helping friends with theirs. “It would have been weird to have a day off without the poultry show,” Addy said. Poultry and bird projects are among the most popular in Woodbury County, drawing approximately 190 entries last year, said Lujean Faber, the county’s Iowa State University Extension and Outreach youth development educator who also oversees the 4-H program. When there aren’t bird flu concerns, the poultry barn is filled with chickens of all colors and shapes, along with ducks, turkeys and other specialty birds like Addy and Brenna’s pheasants and doves. It’s a popular roost for children and adults surprised to learn there are many more types of chickens than the stereotypical white hen and red rooster. “I know when the public comes there, they enjoy seeing the wide variety of poultry,” Faber said. So do Addy and Brenna. Their mother, Jamie, showed yellow pheasants when she was in 4-H, and their grandmother Peggy Davidson hatches golden pheasants and raises other birds. Addy, 17, and Brenna, 14, were attracted to the colorful birds from their first year in 4-H. Addy’s shown bantams and fancy chickens in the past, and will show white doves and peach doves this year, her seventh in 4-H. Brenna was attracted to golden pheasants when she began 4-H five years ago. “I like the pheasants because I think they’re really pretty. I tried them my first year and thought they were pretty easy, so I kept with them,” said Brenna, who will be a Westwood High School freshman. Both Addy and Brenna plan to show four birds at the fair in August, so there’s much feeding, watering and watching them develop champion-worthy plumage to be done. It’s fun, said Addy, who will be a junior at Westwood, to hang out in the poultry barn answering questions from curious fairgoers who don’t have an agricultural background. After facing the reality of being unable to exhibit her pheasants, Brenna said she learned not to take them for granted. Come fair time, she’ll be among the hundreds of visitors appreciating the unique qualities of the different bird breeds. “People get to see crazy birds they don’t usually get to see,” she said. “I’m very excited. I love showing them.” You could say it makes her proud as a peacock. And, thanks to the lifting of the bird show ban, you might see a few of those, too, at this year’s fair. HOLD FOR RELEASE.

{"id": "184", "title": "New Type of Avian Flu Harms Wild Mammals", "date": "2022-06-28", "fulltext": "As a new version of bird flu spread through North America this spring, scientists began finding the virus in red foxes, bobcats and other mammals. Something was wrong with the foxes. That was what callers to the Dane County Humane Society in Wisconsin kept saying in April, as they reported fox kits, or young foxes, behaving in strange ways: shaking, seizing or struggling to stand. The kits, which were often lethargic and wandering by themselves, also seemed unusually easy to approach, showing little fear of humans. 'We just kept getting calls,' said Erin Lemley, a wildlife veterinary technician at the humane society's wildlife center. 'And the foxes started coming in.' Some of the kits that were admitted for treatment were quiet and withdrawn, she said. Others stumbled around or had seizures, their heads ticcing, their eyes flicking rhythmically. After the staff ruled out rabies, low blood sugar and other potential causes, laboratory testing revealed a surprising culprit: a highly virulent strain of avian influenza. 'It was not a fun surprise,' said Dr. Shawna Hawkins, a zoo and wildlife veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The virus, a type of bird flu known as Eurasian H5N1, has been spreading rapidly in the United States this spring, infecting flocks of farmed poultry in 36 states and prompting mass culls of domestic birds. But this version of the virus appears to be taking a much greater toll on wild birds than previous lineages have, finding its way into ducks, geese, gulls and terns, among many others. That, in turn, means that the virus poses an elevated danger to mammals that prey on those birds, including wild red foxes. At least seven U.S. states have detected the virus in red fox kits, to which the pathogen appeared to be particularly lethal. Two bobcats in Wisconsin, a coyote pup in Michigan and skunks in Canada have also tested positive for the virus, as have foxes, otters, a lynx, a polecat and a badger in Europe. (Two human cases, one in the United States and one in Britain, have been reported as well, both of which were in people who had close contact with birds.) There is no evidence that mammals play a significant role in spreading the virus, and the risk to humans remains low, experts said. 'This is very much still an avian virus,' said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. But evolution is a numbers game, he said, and the more mammals the virus infects, the more opportunities it has to pick up new mutations that could help it spread among foxes, bobcats or even humans. 'What it's going to take for this virus to transition from being a duck or a chicken virus to being a mammalian virus is more chances to replicate in those mammalian hosts,' Dr. Webby said. 'So that's why when we see these mammals being infected by this virus, we do take notice.' Twitching foxes The new lineage of the virus spread through Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia last year, sparking outbreaks in wild and domestic birds. It also showed up in a handful of wild mammals, including fox kits in the Netherlands in the spring of 2021. By the end of the year, the virus had made its way to North America. As it raced through the migrating American bird population this spring, reports began to emerge of infected fox kits -- first in Ontario and subsequently in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa, Alaska, Utah and New York. In some bird species, the virus caused obvious neurological symptoms, and many infected foxes displayed abnormal behaviors, too. They twitched, walked in circles and salivated excessively. In the most severe cases, the foxes developed seizures; death often followed shortly after, experts said. Post-mortem examinations revealed that many of the kits had pneumonia, said Dr. Betsy Elsmo, a diagnostic pathologist at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory who performed the necropsies. When she examined the animals' brain tissue under a microscope, Dr. Elsmo saw clear signs of damage. 'There was a lot of inflammation in the brain microscopically,' she said. 'The pattern of injury that I saw was consistent with a viral lesion.' So far, the virus appears to be taking a greater toll on fox kits than adult foxes, potentially because the young animals do not yet have fully developed immune systems, experts said. But the overall infection and mortality rate is unknown. 'We're just getting kind of anecdotal reports in nature right now,' said Michelle Carstensen, the wildlife health program supervisor for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Wisconsin officials also detected the virus in two adult bobcats this spring. 'Both bobcats showed reduced to no fear of humans,' Dr. Lindsey Long, wildlife veterinarian for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said in an email. 'They were noted sitting on porches and in close proximity to human activity without the usual fear response.' One bobcat seemed to be shivering, while the other appeared to be having trouble breathing, she added. The bobcats, which were euthanized, had microscopic brain lesions that were 'pretty much identical' to those in the affected foxes, Dr. Elsmo said. The virus was also recently detected in a coyote pup in Michigan, said Dr. Megan Moriarty, the wildlife veterinary specialist at the state's Department of Natural Resources. Scientists suspect that the animals are acquiring the virus by eating infected birds. In a laboratory study, researchers had previously demonstrated that red foxes that were fed infected bird carcasses could contract, and then shed, the virus. Although it is possible that the virus has evolved in ways that make it better at infecting mammals, scientists say that the most probable explanation for the sudden rise in infected mammals is that this lineage is infecting enormous numbers of wild birds, increasing the odds that hunters and scavengers might stumble across infected food sources. So far, the virus does not appear to be causing enough illness or death in wild mammals to put these species at risk, experts said. And there is no evidence of sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission. 'Mammals are generally considered to be dead-ends for highly pathogenic avian influenza,' Dr. Moriarty said. An early analysis of viral genomes from the Wisconsin fox kits suggests that the infections are essentially a series of one-offs -- the result of individual foxes coming into contact with infected birds rather than foxes transmitting the virus to each other. 'The preliminary data that we have suggests that these are all independent spillover events,' Dr. Elsmo said. But much remains unknown, including whether the virus will establish itself in wild birds for the long haul, which could pose a sustained risk to mammals. And even isolated mammalian infections provide the virus with new opportunities to evolve. 'There's a risk of it adapting to and then transmitting between mammals, and then you have a new problem,' said Dr. Jolianne Rijks, a veterinarian at the Dutch Wildlife Health Center. Some state officials said that they had started more routinely testing sick mammals for the virus, especially ones with neurological symptoms. Animals that test positive should also have samples of their virus sequenced so scientists can monitor for any potentially worrisome changes, Dr. Webby said. Experts also encourage members of the public to report any wild animals that appear to be acting strangely. 'That's how all this started,' Dr. Elsmo said, 'as citizens seeing abnormally behaving kits and reporting them.'

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed that samples from four Maine seals tested positive for the virus. The animals all died or required euthanasia, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Marine mammal rescuers started to notice an unusually high number of seal strandings in June, and then the USDA conducted the tests, NOAA said in a statement. The rate of dead seal strandings in Maine is about three times the normal rate for the summer and is close to 60, the agency said. The USDA is notifying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state animal and public health officials about the deaths, which came after a bird flu outbreak that led to the deaths of tens of millions of chickens and turkeys on farms. The virus is capable of jumping to mammals, though it rarely affects humans. It's not the first instance of bird flu jumping to marine mammals such as seals, but the federal government is monitoring the deaths closely nonetheless, said Allison Ferreira, a NOAA spokesperson. 'There is a national outbreak of avian flu happening, so that was the cause of concern for these animals,' Ferreira said. Most of the seals that have been founded stranded in Maine this summer have been dead, NOAA said. The dead seals have included gray seals and harbor seals. The health risk posed by avian flu to the general public is low; however, precautions are recommended, NOAA's statement said. The agency said people and pets should never approach seals, and should contact authorities if they find an animal they believe is stranded. Elsewhere in New England, hundreds of birds have washed up dead on Martha’s Vineyard, and local officials have sounded the alarm about a possible bird flu outbreak. The source of the outbreak among seals is still being investigated. Marine Mammals of Maine, a rescue organization, that it has responded to 40 stranded seals since June 1. Katy Green, a spokesperson for the organization, said it is 'aware of this evolving situation' and working with NOAA on it. Gray seals and harbor seals are abundant off New England, where they are beloved by wildlife watchers and sometimes bemoaned by fishermen. However, the bird flu deaths don't represent the first time they've died off at an alarming rate. NOAA declared an 'unusual mortality event' for the seals after more than 2,700 of them stranded off Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts from July 2018 to March 2020. Feds attributed those deaths to phocine distemper virus. That virus does not impact humans.

{"id": "186", "title": "Bird Flu May Have Caused Seal Strandings", "date": "2022-07-06", "fulltext": "Unusually high numbers of the marine mammals were found stranded in the last two months along Maine's coast. Samples from four seals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza. The highly pathogenic avian influenza strain that has whipped through flocks of domestic poultry and wild birds this year may also be to blame for a spike in seal strandings in Maine, U.S. officials said on Wednesday. Samples from four recently stranded seals—all of which died or were sick enough to require euthanasia—tested positive for the virus. The strain, officially known as Eurasian H5N1, primarily affects birds. After causing outbreaks in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the virus arrived in North America late last year and quickly spread to commercial poultry farms and along migratory bird routes. The recent outbreaks involving the latest version of the virus have taken a much greater toll on wild birds than previous cycles did. And that has put mammals that feed on wild birds, or have close contact with them, at risk. Scientists have now found the virus in a variety of wild mammals in North America, including foxes, bobcats, skunks and raccoons. \"The seal is the first marine mammal that we've seen on the spillover end,\" Dr. Julianna Lenoch, a national wildlife disease program coordinator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said at a news briefing on Wednesday. \"But this is not unexpected to have bird flu move into mammalian species on occasion.\" Workers with Marine Mammals of Maine, an organization that responds to reports of stranded sea creatures, began noticing an unusually high number of stranded seals last month. From May 10 to July 4, 92 gray and harbor seals were reported stranded in Maine. Many of the seals were found dead. The current rate of dead seal strandings is roughly three times as high as normal, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Other stranded seals were ill, with symptoms that included lethargy, sneezing and coughing. Some also had seizures—a symptom that has been reported in fox kits infected with avian influenza. Marine Mammals of Maine sent samples from eight stranded seals to Tufts University for laboratory testing, Lynda Doughty, the organization's executive director, said at the briefing. Four tested positive for the virus. Most of the strandings so far have been reported in mid-to-southern Maine. \"But there is the potential for this to spread across our coast as live animals move,\" said Ainsley Smith, the coordinator for stranded marine mammals at N.O.A.A.'s Greater Atlantic regional fisheries office. Viruses have been responsible for other mass stranding events among marine mammals, and previous versions of avian influenza have caused fatal outbreaks in seals. The seals are likely catching the virus when they come into close contact with infected birds, or virus-laden bird droppings, after coming ashore, Dr. Deborah Fauquier, a veterinary medical officer at N.O.A.A, said in an email. Officials have not found any bird remains in the stomachs of the seals that have been necropsied, she added. Seals can spread at least some versions of the flu to other seals. However, there is not yet any evidence that this has happened in Maine, said Bryan Richards, the emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center. \"With all of the scavenging mammals, and now with seals, I don't think we have any evidence at all suggesting that each individual animal is anything other than, literally, a dead-end host,\" he said. Although the risk to humans remains low, the infection of mammals increases the odds that the virus could mutate in ways that make it more likely to pose a danger to people. Versions of avian flu that have been isolated from seals during previous outbreaks have shown signs of adaptation to mammals. In the past, similar versions of bird flu have tended to peter out in the summer, when temperatures rise. It is too soon to say whether that will happen this year, Dr. Lenoch said: \"This particular avian influenza is acting a little bit different, so we're going to remain on high alert.\" In the meantime, officials recommended that people and their pets stay a safe distance away from seals and other marine mammals and report stranded animals to the local wildlife authorities.", "media_outlet": "NYTimes", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Although the risk to humans remains low, the infection of mammals increases the odds that the virus could mutate in ways that make it more likely to pose a danger to people.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Versions of avian flu that have been isolated from seals during previous outbreaks have shown signs of adaptation to mammals.", "affirm_why_count": 2, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "With all of the scavenging mammals, and now with seals, I don't think we have any evidence at all suggesting that each individual animal is anything other than, literally, a dead-end host,", "deny_transmissible_statement_2": "However, there is not yet any evidence that this has happened in Maine, said Bryan Richards, the emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center.", "deny_transmissible_count": 2, "deny_why_statement_1": "With all of the scavenging mammals, and now with seals, I don't think we have any evidence at all suggesting that each individual animal is anything other than, literally, a dead-end host.", "deny_why_count": 1, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "187", "title": "Pheasant shoots scaled back across UK after bird flu import bans", "date": "2022-07-08", "fulltext": "RSPB calls for greater regulation of industry to avoid putting native wildlife at risk Pheasant shoots across the UK are being shut down or dramatically scaled back this year because of import bans on the birds after an outbreak of bird flu. A huge number of the gamebirds shot in the country are imported from factory farms in Europe. Experts have said this practice should stop or be reduced because it risks spreading disease and has troubling implications for native nature and biodiversity. Just under 50 million pheasants are usually released each year from continental farms. A recent study suggested that at their peak in August each year, non-native common pheasants and red-legged partridges make up about half of all wild bird biomass in Britain. The annual shooting season begins on 1 October. Jeff Knott, the central and eastern England director at the RSPB, said: 'The most important thing from our perspective is the bird flu situation underlines the risks of importing and releasing millions of birds into the British countryside with very little oversight. It is a very, very unregulated industry and it is something that needs to be looked really hard at.' He called for more regulation for shoots. 'There are inherent risks with bringing so many birds in, and releasing them into the countryside. There is a need to look at greater regulation of the industry to make sure we are not putting native wildlife at risk. Estates don't have to report how many they are bringing in, releasing, how many are being shot.' Mark Avery, who co-runs the nature campaign group Wild Justice, said: 'This is a wake-up call for shooting. Importing tens of millions of non-native pheasants is hardly traditional or sustainable. The environment will benefit all those gamebirds harm our native species. Pheasants gobble up snakes and lizards and damage vegetation. Fewer gamebirds is respite for native wildlife.' Shooting estates are putting measures in place including more breeding of the gamebirds on site to make the sector more resilient to import bans. Glynn Evans, the head of game and gundogs at the British Association of Shooting and Conservation (BASC), said: 'For a number of reasons such as the climate, parts of France are ideal places for game farming and the production of pheasant and partridge eggs. However, an outbreak of avian influenza in the main game farming regions at a critical time of such production has seen restrictions placed on movement. The resulting impact on game shooting in the UK this year will be nothing short of significant. This level of disruption will vary between different shoots. For example, those who hatch and rear their own birds in-house will be largely unaffected, whereas others may be proceeding with scaled-back plans, and we have heard of shoots taking the tough decision not to proceed this year.' He said the reduction in shooting would hit the rural economy, including hotels, pubs and restaurants near shooting estates. 'This is not the first challenge we have faced and it will not be the last. With avian influenza becoming increasingly prevalent, shoots will be looking at their supply chains and how to secure them for the future,' Evans added. This year's outbreak of bird flu has been the longest and largest ever experienced in the UK and in many parts of Europe.

{"id": "188", "title": "Unusual': Feds investigate seal deaths linked to avian flu", "date": "2022-07-20", "fulltext": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The deaths of dozens of seals off the coast of Maine has been deemed an 'unusual mortality event,' sparking a federal investigation into strandings that appear linked to avian influenza. The seal strandings began in June and 159 have been reported through Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Most of the seals were found dead. NOAA gave the strandings, which have affected harbor and gray seals, the 'unusual' designation on Friday. That authorizes a federal investigation to try to determine the cause and minimize deaths. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has already confirmed that samples from four stranded seals tested positive for avian flu, which has been found in more than 40 states since it was detected in winter 2021. The risk to the public from the occurrence of avian flu in seals is low, but beachgoers should take precautions anyway, NOAA representatives said. 'We continue to ask the public not to touch ill, stranded or floating dead seals, to keep pets far away from seals, and to call their local stranding network organization to report live or dead stranded seals,' the agency said in a statement. Most strandings have happened in the southern and central coast of the state from Biddeford to Boothbay, NOAA said. Neither animal is listed under the Endangered Species Act, but both are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The avian flu outbreak has killed tens of million of chickens and turkeys on farms, and the virus is able to jump to mammals. It rarely affects humans. NOAA said it's working with local, state, tribal, federal and international groups on its investigation. Marine Mammals of Maine, a rescue agency, has reported responding to dozens of seal strandings since the beginning of June. 'Strandings have continued to increase,' said Lynda Doughty, founding executive director of the group. 'It has been a really busy season of strandings for us. Our groups are trying to catch all the reports, as much as possible.' Avian influenza has also been detected in dozens of species of wild birds as well as eight species of scavenging mammals, NOAA said. The virus is also affecting Canada, where it has been found in 11 provinces, the agency said. Eds: UPDATES: With AP Photos. Updates number of strandings through Tuesday.

{"id": "190", "title": "Game over for UK shooting season as bird flu and Brexit take a heavy toll", "date": "2022-07-31", "fulltext": "Avian virus outbreak in France and trade barriers have left gamekeepers facing redundancy and shoots likely to go bankrupt. Bird flu has managed to do to game shooting what animal rights activists have been trying to achieve for decades with a little help from Brexit. Dozens of pheasant and partridge shoots have been called off ahead of the shooting season after an unprecedented outbreak of avian flu in France left gamekeepers in the UK with few birds to rear. At least 93 gamekeepers have been made redundant so far this year and some shoots are likely to go bankrupt, according to Dominic Boulton, former chair of the Game Farmers' Association and now its policy adviser. 'That's 93 families that by and large will have had accommodation that comes with their job, and a vehicle,' he said. 'So they may well be facing the loss of everything. There's going to be a significant number of shoots that don't go ahead this year.' About 70% of partridge shoots and nearly a third of planned pheasant shoots may be cancelled this year, according to estimates by Guns On Pegs, a shooting agency. That means a huge reduction in the 57 million red-legged partridges and pheasants reared and released each year in the UK. Grouse shooting, which heralds the start of the shooting season on 12 August with the 'Glorious Twelfth' will not be affected because grouse are not reared and released. Groups such as Wild Justice have campaigned for a reduction in releases, saying that only 30% of the birds are shot and retrieved, which means the survivors indirectly affect protected wildlife. The RSPB says that birds of prey are killed illegally to protect game birds. It also objects to the use of poisonous lead ammunition, which the government is considering outlawing. This year's dramatic reduction in game birds will also affect beaters, catering companies and restaurants, Boulton said, adding that 75% of rural land is managed for shooting of some type including game, and the industry is worth about £1.4bn. The initial signs of disruption came at the end of February when the first case of bird flu was discovered in the Loire valley. 'Roughly half of the birds that we rear in this country originate from an egg laid in France,' Boulton said, estimating that about 90% of partridges and 40% of pheasants come from producers, with 'virtually all' in the Loire valley. After avian flu is detected on a farm, the birds are culled and 30 days later the farmer can start trading birds domestically which for French farmers means within the EU. But international exports must wait for 90 days, under World Organisation for Animal Health guidelines adopted into UK and EU law. The National Gamekeepers' Organisation (NGO) campaigned for the government to create special licences allowing imports before the 90 days were up. After weeks of negotiations, ministers reached an agreement with the EU for a 'bespoke arrangement' but not France. 'Even if we were still in the EU and operating under the 30-day rule, we would still have been in trouble,' Boulton said, adding that French officials had created false hope among shooters that imports might restart in time. 'If you want to start shooting on 1 October [when the pheasant season begins], your birds need to be eight weeks old by the end of June when they can be released into the wild.' The last outbreak in France was detected on 17 May and 16 million farmed birds, including poultry, were culled. By 22 June, there had been 1,464 bird flu cases, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). French farmers have been devastated. Otto Tepasse founded his central London restaurant, Otto's, on traditional French cuisine. Canard à la Presse is his signature dish, made with Challans ducks from the Maison Burgaud farm in the Loire. 'I have not been serving any duck since it started,' he said. 'This farm has been in business since the 1930s and they are the main farm for three-star Michelin restaurants. Now everything has been wiped out.' The farm was given the all-clear only in mid-July, he said, but they are now trying to find new stock. Diners will have to wait until the end of September before they can eat his pressed duck again. Bird flu has been reported in 35 European countries in 2022, and the UK saw a near fivefold increase in cases to 122 so far this year. Free-range eggs were unavailable for five weeks because the outbreaks meant that British chickens had to be kept inside, and last month Defra established a research consortium led by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) to investigate how to prevent the spread of the virus. Outbreaks killed thousands of seabirds in the Farne Islands off the coast of Northumberland earlier this month, and thousands more gannets, gulls and puffins across Scotland, leading to a ban on visitors to 23 Scottish islands. The virus spreads from wild birds to captive ones, possibly through droppings and direct contact. One theory of how the virus circulates is that the birds that migrate to the Arctic during the summer then pass it to each other. Birds also mix in central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan on migration routes. The NGO said it was too early to say how the shooting season would be affected, but its chairman, David Pooler, was pleased with how the government had acted. 'We have been assured that the government is trying to put in place measures which would prevent similar incidents from happening again in future.' A Defra spokesperson said the department had tried to balance the egg trade with the country's 'high standards of biosecurity following this year's avian influenza outbreak. Unfortunately, due to a range of external factors, it was not possible to put measures in place in time for this year's shooting season.

{"id": "191", "title": "�he scale is hard to grasp� avian flu wreaks devastation on seabirds", "date": "2022-08-05", "fulltext": "Dozens of coastal sites in the UK closed to the public as H5N1 continues to sweep through wild bird populations across the world A quarter of Europe's breeding seabirds spend spring in the UK, turning our coastline into a giant maternity unit. These noisy outcrops usually stink of bird poo. However, this year has been different. Instead of the smell of guano, it's the smell of death, says Gwen Potter, a National Trust countryside manager working on the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland. It's completely horrendous. This annual congregation of life has turned into a super-spreader event, as a highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5N1 also known as bird flu sweeps through populations of breeding birds, causing devastating losses. More than 300 outbreaks have been reported in UK seabird colonies, and dozens of coastal sites have closed to the public. The Farne Islands are home to 200,000 seabirds, including Arctic terns, Atlantic puffins, guillemots, kittiwakes and razorbills. Potter is one of many conservationists swapping binoculars for a hazmat suit, picking up the bodies of birds she has spent her career trying to protect. Birds will sit on the ground, unable to move, twisting into unnatural positions, before dying. It is happening with chicks, too, still gently trying to flap as they die. It sweeps through, takes everything in its path. It doesn't seem to spare anything, really we've collected thousands of dead birds, and that's the tip of the iceberg. It's just the scale of it which is hard to grasp, she says. Early observations suggest that how closely the birds nest is a key factor in how quickly the virus is transmitted. Guillemots nest quite densely, and kittiwakes are often next to them, which makes them vulnerable, although there is more space between them. Terns also nest densely and already 25% of the 350 sandwich terns on the Farne Islands are thought to have died, according to Potter. Some seabird chicks jump into the sea prematurely if their parents have died, while others starve in the nest. Most seabirds will fly away in the coming weeks once their chicks are raised, but the true impact on populations will not be known for a few years, with concerns that some may never recover. I don't want to contemplate that because it will make me cry, says Potter. Britain has about 8 million seabirds, including 90% of the world's Manx shearwater and about two-thirds of northern gannets and great skuas. Any impact on these populations is of global conservation significance. Tens of thousands of birds must have died, maybe hundreds of thousands. It seems as though this breeding season will have been a disaster. Many will have died on remote islands, but the monitoring is nowhere near good enough, says the ornithologist Mark Avery, who describes the deaths so far as an international disaster. Already, it looks very serious and I fear this is just the start. Seabirds are particularly vulnerable because they are typically long-lived animals that don't reach breeding age until they are about five years old. They generally only have a few chicks, so populations take longer to recover. Nationally, the three species that are most at risk are the great skua, gannet and sandwich tern, according to Niall Burton, from the British Trust for Ornithology. We are talking about very long-term recovery. It's something that is unprecedented, certainly in my lifetime The world population of great skua is about 16,000 and early research on the impact of the disease suggests that between 64% and 85% of the population at some sites has died, mainly in Shetland, Orkney and the Outer Hebrides. Burton says it will take several years for populations to recover but that it was too early to be more exact. The biggest population of gannets on the planet, at Bass Rock, an island off the coast of North Berwick, in East Lothian, Scotland, has been badly impacted. Gannets nest in large colonies and there are few of them in the UK as a whole. Bird flu seems to be present in most of them, with a few exceptions in Ireland and Wales. Across the Channel, 10% of France's total breeding population of sandwich terns is believed to have died in the space of a week, with high casualties also reported in the Netherlands. Coquet Island, off the Northumberland coast, is the UK's only colony for breeding roseate terns, with about 150 breeding pairs. More than two-thirds of chicks have died. We are talking about very long-term recovery. It's something that is unprecedented, certainly in my lifetime, says Burton. The story of this latest bird flu epidemic dates back to 1996 when the H5N1 strain was found in a population of commercial geese in Asia. In 2005, wild birds started dying en masse. The current wave of the H5N1 strain has resulted in more than 77 million domestic birds being culled. About 400,000 non-poultry birds which includes wild birds are reported to have died, which is double the number of deaths in the previous wave, in 2016-17. For the first half of this year, H5N1 was a problem for domestic poultry, leading all chickens to be shut inside between November last year and May, with the result that at one point it was impossible to get UK free-range eggs. Already there were reports of the disease's impact on wild wintering populations, including the death of more than one-third of the Svalbard barnacle goose population on the Solway Firth (16,500 out of a total population of 43,000). There were reports of birds falling from the sky in distress With the arrival of spring, the problem escalated. It is now considered to be the worst ever bird flu outbreak in the UK, noted for the large area it has affected but also high levels of chick mortality. Almost every country in Europe has had cases in the latest outbreak, as well as those in North America, west Africa and Asia. Fragmented bird populations are most at risk. There are about 8,000 Dalmatian pelicans left in the world, and more than 2,000 have already died from bird flu. We are facing an event of mass extinction of animals. Entire populations are affected by this virus, says Uri Naveh, a senior scientist at the Israel Parks and Nature Authority. Early observations suggest that about 50% of birds infected with the virus die from it, but Prof Diana Bell, a conservation biologist at the University of East Anglia, who studied the H5N1 strain back in 2007, says the figure is more like 100%. Anything that gets infected is not going to survive, unless the H5N1 has attenuated in its virulence during that time, but I don't think so, she says. I look in horror at what it is doing to our birds we just have to really hope there are a decent number that have survived, but I don't think it's because they've had it and they've recovered. Bell's research suggests it affects birds in most orders. Tigers have been fed infected poultry and died, she says, and there have recently been reports of seals dying from it in the US. In terms of how the virus will spread, Prof Paul Digard, the chair of virology at the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, says it is impossible to generalise from one species to another, so he doesn't believe it will kill 100% of those it infects, partly because of intrinsic genetic differences, and partly because of factors such as stress, age and other traits in specific populations. He says H5N1 is causing a huge amount of damage because it is spreading among populations that have not had the virus before, but that this will change in the future because some will survive. My guess is that things will calm down over time as populations gain immunity to this circulating strain of virus. I would hope not to see the same levels of mortality in the coming years, but that's something of a guess, he says. The main factors contributing to its spread are international trade, the farming and sale of birds, and the migration of wild birds, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health. Birds that have no symptoms could be super-spreaders because they can still fly long distances. However, Bell says she has never heard of an asymptomatic bird with the virus and therefore doesn't think wild birds would be able to spread it over long distances. She believes the international poultry trade is the main driver of the virus and says stopping imports of chicks and birds for the trade would be an important step in reducing the risk of future outbreaks. Originally, it was poultry to wild birds; it was not wild birds which were spreading it. It was frustrating to see wild birds being blamed we've got to get out of our heads that the wild birds are the bad guys here, she says. The public should keep their distance from any carcasses and report them to the government helpline. At the moment it does not appear to be infecting humans, but previous strains of the virus have. If you see a sick bird, leave it be, I'm afraid, says Digard. Don't take it to an animal shelter. You are potentially signing a death warrant for all the other birds in that shelter. The most important thing would be better surveillance of the situation, says Potter, who believes there needs to be a government-led plan for all four UK countries, with guidance for effective carcass collection and testing, and better biosecurity on poultry farms. Seabirds have already been hit by a range of threats, including habitat loss, overfishing and climate change; their populations have halved since the 1980s. Reducing these other pressures would make them more resilient to bird flu. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: There are limited effective actions that can be taken to protect wild birds, as opposed to captive bird flocks. Due to the migratory habits of wild birds, it will only be with breeding season monitoring next year that the full impact will become apparent. However, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) carries out year-round avian influenza surveillance of dead wild birds, and clear public guidance has been issued not to handle their carcasses. This article was amended on 3 & 5 August 2022 because an earlier version was wrong to say that St Abb's Head, in Berwickshire, Scotland has the biggest population of gannets on the planet, and that has been halved. The biggest population of gannets is at Bass Rock, off the coast of North Berwick, Scotland; that population has been badly impacted although specific figures have not been released.

Fair CEO Jerome Hertel in a statement said officials believed it was best 'to err on the side of caution.' The fair in Palmer, which begins Aug. 19, usually has poultry exhibits with birds such as geese, turkey and ducks, the Anchorage Daily News reported. The fair will still include a baby chick exhibit, officials said. In late April, state officials announced the first confirmed case in Alaska of a strain of a highly pathogenic avian flu virus.

Of all our seabird sites, none is more special than the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland.

{"id": "194", "title": "Bird flu kills 700 black vultures, closes animal sanctuary", "date": "2022-08-23", "fulltext": "LOCUST GROVE, Ga. (AP) — Bird flu has killed hundreds of wild black vultures at a Georgia sanctuary that houses more than 1,500 other animals. No other birds at Noah's Ark have tested positive for or shown symptoms of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, sanctuary officials told news outlets. An outbreak of the virus has led to the deaths of 40 million chickens and turkeys and about 2,000 wild birds this year. The wild birds include more than 240 black vultures and nearly 220 bald eagles, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Even seals have died from it. Officials said they were told Saturday that initial tests indicate the black vultures that roost at Noah's Ark died of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. State authorities were notified when an unusual number of dead vultures were found Aug. 13, according to a statement released to news outlets. At least 700 black vultures have died, Noah's Ark animal care manager Allison Hedgecoth told WXIA-TV. State workers euthanized 20 to 30 other birds, she said. \"All of our chickens were euthanized yesterday and our turkeys and our guinea hens,\" she said. The station reported that the sanctuary is home to more than 500 birds. Those include an ostrich, emus, a peacock, two sandhill cranes, cockatoos, and a Eurasian eagle owl, according to the sanctuary's website. Noah's Ark is in Locust Grove, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Atlanta. It's more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of the area where hundreds of birds in a mixed backyard flock died or were euthanized earlier this year and most of the previously reported 15 wild bird deaths from the virus were located. A sign on the Noah's Ark website said it will be closed through Sept. 3. Georgia's Department of Agriculture and Department of Natural Resources set up a six-mile (9.6 kilometer) perimeter around the sanctuary in hope of containing the spread, according to WXIA. \"With birds that are able to move around and airborne, this disease could spread pretty rapidly if it's not contained very quickly,\" State Sen.

A note on the Noah's Ark website Tuesday said the sanctuary, which houses more than 1,500 animals in Locust Grove, will be closed until Sept. 30. However, the state veterinarian, Dr. Janemarie Hennebelle, said in a video Friday that birds there will be quarantined for at least five months. Just over 100 were euthanized because they were at high risk for the virus, she said. Noah's Ark said euthanized birds included peacocks, peahens, emus, ostrich, Guinea fowl, chickens, turkeys and geese, one owl, one crow and one sandhill crane. \"These species of birds can be carriers of the avian influenza and were exposed to the vulture population that has been dying off,\" it said in Monday's unsigned statement. Noah's Ark still has hundreds of birds which are alive and well, the sanctuary said. Hennebelle and state Agriculture Secretary Gary Black did not identify Noah's Ark by name, describing it only as a non-commercial flock in Henry County. The state Agriculture Department was notified Aug. 13 that an unusual number of black vultures had died, and was told five days later that domestic ducks were showing bird flu symptoms, Hennebelle said. She said samples were taken from the ducks on Aug. 19, and three days later a federal lab confirmed that it was the H5N1 strain. That strain has infected commercial and backyard flocks in 39 states and has been reported in 2,100 wild birds in all but a handful of states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. \"As a natural disease event, the site needs to be contained, cleaned up and then sanitized/disinfected. We are at the contained stage,\" said a statement Monday from Noah's Ark. \"Our State Agency partners are and will lead clean up and sanitization. They will lead full vulture removal and roost removal and sanitation.\" Neither state officials nor Noah's Ark said how many black vultures have died there.

{"id": "196", "title": "Deadly bird flu returns to Midwest earlier than expected", "date": "2022-08-31", "fulltext": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Bird flu has returned to the Midwest earlier than authorities expected after a lull of several months, with the highly pathogenic disease being detected in two commercial turkey flocks in western Minnesota and a hobby flock in Indiana, officials said Wednesday. The disease was detected after a farm in Meeker County reported an increase in mortality last weekend, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health said. The flock was euthanized to stop the spread. The board later reported that a second flock in the county tested positive Tuesday evening. They were the first detections of avian influenza in Minnesota since May 31, when a backyard flock was struck in Becker County. Indiana's case was its first since a backyard flock there tested positive June 8, which had been the last detection in the Midwest before this week. However, there have been several detections in western states in July and August, including California, where a half-dozen commercial farms have had to kill more than 425,000 chickens and turkeys since last week. There have also been cases in Washington, Oregon and Utah, plus a few in some eastern states. While the timing of this detection is a bit sooner than we anticipated, we have been preparing for a resurgence of the avian influenza we dealt with this spring, said Dr. Shauna Voss, the board's senior veterinarian. PAI is here and biosecurity is the first line of defense to protect your birds. The Indiana State Board of Animal Health reported that a small hobby flock of chickens, ducks and geese in northern Indiana's Elkhart County tested presumptively positive on Tuesday, though final confirmation from a federal lab was pending. Across the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 414 flocks in 39 states have been affected since February, costing producers over 40 million birds, mostly commercial turkeys and chickens. The disease has struck 81 Minnesota flocks this year, requiring the killing of nearly 2.7 million birds. Minnesota produces more turkeys annually than any other state. This year's outbreak contributed to a spike in egg and meat prices, and killed an alarming number of bald eagles and other wild birds. It also affected some zoos. It appeared to be waning in June, but officials warned then that another surge could take hold this fall. The disease is typically carried by migrating birds. It only occasionally affects humans, such as farm workers, and the USDA keeps poultry from infected flocks out of the food supply. A widespread outbreak in 2015 killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion.

{"id": "197", "title": "Record Turkey Prices Are Coming for Thanksgiving; This year's bird-flu outbreak has killed six million turkeys, lowering supplies and lifting prices to their highest levels ever", "date": "2022-09-02", "fulltext": "Inflation is coming for Thanksgiving dinner. Turkey supplies have become stretched this year after an avian-influenza outbreak devastated flocks in the springtime and threatens to re-emerge in the fall, meat industry executives said. Reduced flocks have lifted turkey prices to record levels, analysts said, and price tags for the holiday staple are likely to remain high through Thanksgiving. The bird-flu outbreak has affected 39 states this year and has led to the death of more than 40 million birds, including roughly 6 million turkeys, according to the Agriculture Department—the second-deadliest outbreak on record. Newly confirmed cases in California and Minnesota have farmers and processors fearing a resurgence of the virus in the months ahead, analysts and executives said. Breast-meat prices for consumers have climbed above $6.50 a pound this year, compared with less than $2 a pound two years ago, according to market-research firm Urner Barry. Turkey hens—which represent the majority of birds served on Thanksgiving—currently cost 57% more than the five-year average, the firm estimated. Both prices represent all-time highs. Some of the biggest U.S. turkey suppliers said the virus has already cut into their supplies, pushing up prices. Hormel Foods Corp., the second-largest turkey processor by volume behind Butterball LLC, said on Thursday that sales volumes for its Jennie-O Turkey Store brand fell 20% year over year for the three months that ended July 31. For the current quarter, the company expects sales volumes to be 30% lower. Jacinth Smiley, Hormel's chief financial officer, said, 'Lower industrywide turkey supplies are expected to keep prices higher.' Hormel executives said on Thursday that recent cases have affected its turkey supply chain, and that the company expects reduced production volume through at least the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The combination of higher turkey-meat prices and limited supply helped boost Minnesota-based Hormel's quarterly profits from its turkey business, which increased by about $30 million from 2021 levels. Turkey supplies were tight before the bird-flu outbreak, following years of cutbacks by farmers responding to stagnant consumer demand and overproduction, said Russ Whitman, senior vice president at Urner Barry. Despite escalating prices, higher animal-feed costs are keeping turkey farmers from expanding their flocks, he said. The National Turkey Federation, a trade group for the industry, still expects there will be enough turkeys to go around for the coming holiday season. Supply-chain problems have contributed to sporadic shortages of turkey products in the short term, said Beth Breeding, a spokeswoman for the group. The tight turkey supply means some supermarkets might not get the exact quantity of 10-pound or 16-pound birds they ordered from their supplier for the holiday season, Urner Barry's Mr. Whitman said, and it is likely to be more expensive. 'Retailers are not getting what they want, they are getting what is available,' he said. Turkey production for the third quarter of this year is estimated to be down nearly 7%, or about 20 million pounds, compared with the same period a year ago, according to the USDA. Some farmers are trying to reduce the risk of bird-flu outbreaks by sending their turkeys to market earlier, and at lower weights than usual, according to analysts at agriculture lender CoBank. That has contributed to lower overall production, they said. Excessive heat this summer, which makes it harder for turkeys and chickens to gain weight, also tightened the turkey-meat supply, industry officials said. Cargill Inc., the third-largest turkey processor, hasn't been hit by the bird-flu outbreak as badly as others, said Tom Windish, president of Cargill's primary business division, which oversees turkey. The company this summer started getting more orders from retailers looking for suppliers with turkeys, he said. To help keep prices lower for consumers, Cargill is shipping more packages to retailers with less turkey in each one, Mr. Windish said. Cost-conscious customers may also opt for smaller turkeys this Thanksgiving to keep their spending down, he said. A 2015 avian-influenza outbreak, the deadliest on record—it led to the death of about 50 million birds—ended in the middle of that year, and turkey-industry officials have said they hoped the same would hold this year. Ms. Breeding, of the National Turkey Federation, said that in 2015 there were brief interruptions in the availability of some turkey items, but these were resolved before the holiday season. After months of declining cases among commercial poultry flocks, the USDA confirmed several outbreaks this past week in California, leading to the death of nearly 400,000 turkeys. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health also confirmed that a commercial turkey flock was culled this past week in response to a bird-flu case. The timing of the detection was sooner than anticipated, said Shauna Voss, senior state veterinarian in Minnesota. Entire poultry flocks are destroyed after an infection is confirmed to help limit the spread. Warm weather has slowed the spread of the virus in the past, but the recent cases in California suggest that this strain may be more resistant to heat, analysts said. Following the 2015 outbreak, the USDA upgraded its virus testing and detection systems, training and equipment, officials have said. Some farmers invested in new biosecurity systems for their barns meant to disinfect anyone who walks into the tightly sealed poultry houses so as not to track in wild-bird fecal matter. Despite the changes, farmers and USDA officials have struggled to halt this year's outbreak. 'All we can do is concentrate on our operations,' said Cargill's Mr. Windish.

{"id": "199", "title": "Bird Flu Found in Dolphin in Florida and Porpoise in Sweden", "date": "2022-09-07", "fulltext": "The findings represent the first time a highly pathogenic form of the virus, which has devastated bird populations this year, has been detected in cetaceans. A bottlenose dolphin found dead in a Florida canal this past spring tested positive for a highly virulent strain of bird flu, scientists said on Wednesday. The announcement came a week after Swedish officials reported that they had found the same type of avian influenza in a stranded porpoise. This version of the virus, which has spread widely among North American and European birds, has affected an unusually broad array of species. But these findings represent the first two documented cases in cetaceans, a group of marine mammals that includes dolphins, porpoises and whales. It is too soon to say how commonly the virus infects cetaceans, but its discovery in two different species on two different continents suggests that there have 'almost certainly' been other cases, said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. 'Our surveillance activities on a global scale are never sensitive enough to pick up the only two events of this kind,' said Dr. Webby, who was not involved in the initial detection of the virus but is now working with the Florida team on follow-up studies. The virus has become so widespread in birds that it would not be surprising to see the pathogen pop up in other unexpected species, he said. 'Unfortunately, I think this is maybe just sort of a sign of what's to come should this virus not disappear,' he added. Experts emphasize that the risk to humans remains low. In the United States, the version of the virus that is circulating has caused just one documented human infection, in a person known to have had contact with poultry, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the spread of the virus to new species poses potential risks to wildlife and provides the virus with new chances to mutate and adapt to mammalian hosts. This strain of bird flu, known as Eurasian H5N1, has spread rapidly through domestic poultry, affecting tens of millions of farmed birds, according to the Agriculture Department. Compared to previous versions of the virus, this lineage has taken an especially heavy toll on wild bird populations, felling eagles, owls, pelicans and more. That, in turn, has put mammals that encounter wild birds at risk. As the outbreaks expanded this spring, the virus turned up in foxes, bobcats, skunks and other species. The virus has also been blamed for a spike in seal strandings in Maine, where bird flu has been detected in both gray and harbor seals. The Florida dolphin, a young male, was found in March in a canal in Dixie County, where area residents noticed that the animal had become trapped between the pilings of a pier and a sea wall, said Dr. Michael Walsh, a veterinarian at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine who leads the university's marine animal rescue program. By the time rescuers arrived, the dolphin had died, he said. The team, which routinely conducts necropsies, collected a variety of samples from the dolphin and stored them until they could be analyzed in more detail. At the time, the scientists had no reason to suspect that bird flu had made its way into dolphins, and they were not in a particular rush, said Dr. Walsh, who collaborated on the investigation with Dr. Robert Ossiboff, a veterinary pathologist, and Andrew Allison, a veterinary virologist, both at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine. When the results came back this summer, they revealed signs of inflammation in the dolphin's brain and the surrounding tissues, Dr. Walsh said. Scientists have previously documented brain inflammation in fox kits infected with the virus, which can cause neurological symptoms in birds and mammals. Subsequent laboratory testing turned up Eurasian H5N1 in the dolphin's brain and lungs. 'The brain tissue really showed a high level of virus,' Dr. Walsh said. Whether the virus contributed to the dolphin's death remains unknown, as does precisely how the animal contracted it. But it is not hard to imagine a young dolphin investigating an ailing bird near the shoreline, Dr. Walsh said, adding: 'These animals are always curious about their environment and checking things out. So if he came upon a sick, either dying or dead, bird, he might be very curious about it. He might mouth it.' The virus was also responsible for the death of a porpoise found stranded in Sweden in June, the Swedish National Veterinary Institute said last week. The pathogen was found in several of the animal's organs, including the brain, according to the agency. So far, there is no evidence that cetaceans are spreading the virus to one another, Dr. Webby said. And Dr. Webby's team, which has isolated and sequenced the virus detected in the Florida dolphin, has not found any signs that it has picked up mutations associated with adaptation to mammals. 'It still very much looks like a virus that you would pick up out of a bird,' he said. But now that dolphins and porpoises are known to be susceptible, researchers can begin to look for the virus more proactively, including in any tissue samples they previously collected. 'Now, everybody's going to be on guard for this,' Dr. Walsh said.

{"id": "200", "title": "Bird flu �n urgent warning to move away from factory farming�", "date": "2022-10-06", "fulltext": "Experts claim deadly spillovers of disease between livestock and wildlife are increasing with the growth in intensive methods Catastrophic declines in the number of birds and other wildlife are likely if countries do not act urgently to change the way animals are farmed, wildlife health scientists have warned. The unprecedented die-off of seabirds from highly pathogenic avian flu (HPAI) being witnessed in breeding colonies across Europe, North America and Africa has been traced back to a commercial goose farm in southern China where a relatively mild bird disease mutated into a killer in 1996. After spilling into wild bird populations in 2007, HPAI has spread around the world, killing millions of birds and showing no sign of stopping. Spillovers of disease between livestock and wildlife have increased as intensive farming has escalated to feed growing wealthier human populations demanding cheap meat. Over the past 50 years, the global population of poultry has multiplied six times, from 5.7 to nearly 36 billion; the number of pigs has almost doubled, from 547.2 to 952.6 million; and cattle numbers have grown from 1.1 to 1.5 billion. But the risk of spillovers and new pathogens emerging from larger herds and flocks of commercial animals has also grown as intensive livestock farming has been normalised. These large livestock populations, which are connected through trade, form reservoirs where infectious diseases can evolve and spill over into wildlife, occasionally with devastating consequences, wrote Thijs Kuiken, professor in the department of viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, and lead author of the editorial published this week in the journal Science. Kuiken goes on to describe the HPAI outbreak in seabirds as a warning, with devastating consequences if not heeded. Farm animals are increasingly passing disease to wildlife said co-author Ruth Cromie, councillor for wildlife health for the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. She highlights the spread of African swine fever across Europe and Asia through the trade of pigs and pig meat products, spilling over into wild boar and threatening endangered species of wild suids (pigs) in south-east Asia. Other spillovers mentioned by the authors included Mycoplasma gallisepticum bacteria from poultry to finches and other songbirds in North America. The authors argue that governments must protect wildlife from diseases linked to human activities. They propose reducing livestock herd sizes and densities on farms, limiting the transport of livestock from farm to farm, and restricting contacts between farmed animals and related wild species. In middle- and high-income countries, they say humans should move from animal- to plant-based proteins. Sam Sheppard, professor of microbial genomics and evolution at Oxford university, who was not involved in the editorial, said only a move away from intensive livestock farming would reduce disease risk. Because of the sheer size of these host niches with many millions of individual animals, viruses and bacteria inevitably spill over into the environment and into wild animal species.

{"id": "201", "title": "Fears of Christmas goose shortages as UK� biggest producer hit by bird flu", "date": "2022-10-07", "fulltext": "UK's only large-scale supplier is understood to have suffered multiple outbreaks over the past week. Shoppers could face shortages of British goose this Christmas after the UK's biggest producer is understood to have been hit by multiple bird flu outbreaks. The UK has suffered what officials have said is the 'largest ever outbreak of avian flu' over the past year, with more than 140 reported outbreaks in England alone. The situation is particularly acute in Norfolk and Suffolk after 14 outbreaks in the past month alone. Suffolk-based Gressingham Foods, which raises ducks, geese and seasonal turkeys, has been hit particularly hard, according to industry insiders, after five outbreaks on its sites across the two counties in the past week. Thousands of birds are understood to have been culled. As the main supplier to UK supermarkets, there are fears the availability of British goose this Christmas will be severely affected, with about 250,000 geese eaten over the festive period. Goose is normally made available to buy by retailers from late October. Although there are farmgate options for the public to seek out goose for Christmas, retailers are likely to have to look at imports, said Richard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council (BPC). There are other UK-based duck producers, but Gressingham Foods is the UK's only year-round supplier of duck meat. Gressingham Foods did not respond to requests for comment, but UK supermarkets downplayed any concerns about duck or goose meat availability. 'Retailers are well versed at managing supply chains under challenging conditions. They are monitoring the continuing spread of avian flu and have asked the government to take all appropriate steps to reduce its spread to ensure continued supply for customers,' said Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium. Avian flu is probably carried by migrating birds, spreading through direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear. In the event of a confirmed outbreak, any surviving birds in a flock are culled, with farmers compensated for the healthy birds. Across Europe as a whole, 47.7 million birds have been culled since last autumn and many more thousands of wild birds have died. More than 100,000 ducks were reportedly culled at farms owned by Gressingham Foods earlier this year during previous outbreaks of bird flu. The situation is likely to worsen as autumn migration begins and the number of wild birds wintering in Europe increases the risk of outbreaks. In previous years cases dropped in the summer, but this year outbreaks continued with experts suspecting highly pathogenic variants of avian flu are now endemic in wild birds, creating a risk of infection all year. The British Poultry Council has called for a UK-wide compulsory housing order for all farmed birds 'as soon as possible to prioritise the wellbeing of our farmers, the viability of their businesses and the safety of all birds.'

{"id": "203", "title": "With Fall Migration, Bird Flu Flies Back Into Town", "date": "2022-10-11", "fulltext": "When a highly contagious strain of avian influenza began racing across the United States this spring, the Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota prepared for an influx of ailing birds. 'But we never could have anticipated the flood of patients that arrived,' said Dr. Victoria Hall, executive director of the center, which provides medical care for birds of prey. From late March to early June of this year, Dr. Hall and her colleagues saw more than 180 flu-afflicted birds, including scores of great horned owls, red-tailed hawks and bald eagles. Many were severely ill, suffering from seizures or unable to see or stand. Caring for these animals—just one of which survived—was emotional, draining work that required long hours in personal protective equipment, including Tyvek suits and respirators. So it came as an immense relief when cases tailed off this summer, falling to just one in July and zero in August. But in September, the sick raptors returned. Last month, the center had 11 confirmed cases of the avian flu, Dr. Hall said: 'It's definitely coming back through.' This year's avian influenza outbreak is the worst the United States has experienced since 2015, the last time the country was hit hard by bird flu. So far, the virus has affected 47 million farmed birds, nearly the same number as in the 2014-15 season. But by all other measures, this year's outbreak is 'radically different than what we've seen before,' said Bryan Richards, the emerging disease coordinator at the National Wildlife Health Center, which is part of the U.S. Geological Survey. This year's is more wide-ranging, spreading to almost every state, and is having a much greater effect on wild birds, infecting more than 100 species in North America, according to Mr. Richards. (The virus currently poses little risk to humans, experts say.) And, unlike in 2015, the virus did not fizzle out over the summer. Instead, it continued to circulate in wild birds, many of which spend their summers in the Arctic. Now, as wild birds fly south for the winter, they are bringing the virus with them. Cases are climbing again in a number of northern states and popping up for the first time in some southern ones, such as Mississippi, Arkansas and New Mexico. Poultry farms are familiar with the risks of avian influenza, but for many zoos, rehabilitation centers and facilities that house wild birds, it is a formidable new threat. They are bracing themselves for a resurgence—and wondering whether the virus is here to stay. 'We'll just have to be on alert,' said Dr. Trevor Zachariah, the director of veterinary programs at Florida's Brevard Zoo, where infected wild vultures keep finding their way onto the property. 'We may have to live with this.' Spring surge Avian influenza wings its way around the world in the bodies of migrating birds, especially in water birds such as ducks, geese and gulls. Some of these birds, which can carry the virus without showing symptoms, share summer habitats in the Arctic, where they may swap pathogens, picking up new flu strains. 'It's like bringing the kids to day care from different suburbs,' said Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. 'As they commingle, that's where the virus moves around on a global scale.' As infected birds migrate, they shed the virus in their feces, mucus and saliva, seeding infections in flocks of farmed fowl, in which some flu strains can be fatal. The current outbreak began in late 2021, when a highly pathogenic strain of flu known as Eurasian H5N1 was detected in birds in Eastern Canada. The virus made its way down the Atlantic coast to Florida and then exploded this spring, when migrating birds carried the pathogen north and west. Along the way, it not only infiltrated hundreds of commercial flocks but also began felling wild birds, taking out entire families of owls and triggering die-offs of geese and gulls. 'We've never seen anything like this before,' said Ashton Kluttz, the executive director of the Bird Rescue Center in Sonoma County, Calif., which created extra makeshift hospitals to handle the patient load. (The virus also found its way into mammals, from foxes to seals.) Scientists are not yet certain why the virus is taking such a high toll on wild birds this year. It may be that the virus has changed to become more contagious among wild species or better adapted to them. A cold, wet spring might also have given the virus more opportunity to take hold in wild populations, Dr. Poulsen said. Rehabilitation centers, sanctuaries and zoos have scrambled to put new precautions in place, moving vulnerable birds inside and suspending public programs. After Tri-State Bird Rescue & Research, in Delaware, identified its first case in February—triggering a three-week quarantine—it adopted new disinfection protocols and stopped accepting waterfowl from other rehabilitation centers. 'We have—fortunately, knock wood—not had an outbreak at our center,' said Lisa Smith, the rescue's executive director. But, she added, 'We know the virus is still out there.' Fall flights Cases ebbed in many places this summer, but the virus never completely disappeared. Now, it's on the move. Blue-winged teal, a type of duck, are among the first species to fly south in the fall. In mid-September, three hunter-harvested teal tested positive for the virus in Mississippi, marking the first detections in that state. The finding affirms that, 'Yes, the virus persisted in northern latitudes through the summer,' Mr. Richards said. 'And it's coming back on the wings of wild waterfowl.' Wisconsin began to see a spike in wild bird infections around Labor Day, Dr. Poulsen said, and recently documented its first poultry outbreaks since May. 'We were really hoping that we were out of the woods,' he said. The virus appears to be making a comeback in other northern regions, including Minnesota, North Dakota and Alberta, Canada. So far, experts have said, the surge has been smaller than it was in the spring. 'But there's lots more geese and ducks to come down out of the Arctic,' said Margo Pybus, a provincial wildlife disease specialist at Alberta's Fish and Wildlife Division. Farther south, wildlife facilities are preparing for a flood of fall migrants. Southern California was spared in the spring, but Dr. Hendrik Nollens, the vice president of wildlife health at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, does not expect to be so lucky this fall. The San Diego Zoo and its sister facility, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, covered their outdoor aviaries and removed food and water sources that might attract avian interlopers, even going so far as to drain a pond popular with wild ducks. They also moved 900 birds into more protected habitats—a herculean effort that involved relocating hundreds of flamingos, Dr. Nollens said. To pull off the feat, employees guided many of the flamingos into enclosed trailers, which delivered the animals to covered or indoor habitats. Staff members modified these new spaces to suit the leggy wading birds, adding feeding pools, trimming low-hanging tree branches and raising the sprinklers designed to keep their feathers in fine fettle. When the flamingos will return home is unclear. 'When do we stop doing these things is actually a tough challenge,' Dr. Nollens said. 'We don't know what's going to happen from here.' The long haul The signs from Europe, where the outbreaks began earlier than they did in North America, were not encouraging. There, the virus has persisted through multiple migration cycles, fueling 'the largest avian flu epidemic ever observed on the continent,' according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Although the scope and scale of future outbreaks is hard to predict, scientists said that they expected the virus to persist through the winter, then to travel north again in the spring. 'I don't see any reason to suggest this is going to go away anytime soon,' Mr. Richards said. And if the virus does stick around? 'It is going to have huge implications for anybody with either permanently captive or transitory captive wildlife in their care,' Dr. Hall said. The Raptor Center plans to continue testing all incoming patients for the virus indefinitely and is considering building a more permanent triage and quarantine area, she added. In California, the Bird Rescue Center recently decided to add an avian influenza unit to its new facility, which is not slated to open until at least late 2023. The Oregon Zoo, which moved many of its birds indoors in August, does not want to keep the animals cooped up for long. 'It's just not good welfare,' said Dr. Carlos Sanchez, the zoo's head veterinarian. 'They need the space to move. They need the sun.' So employees are working to reopen aviaries with new precautions in place, such as foot baths where visitors can disinfect their shoes. In the long run, managing the risks may require facilities to be watchful and nimble, tightening and loosening precautions as outbreaks flare and fade. At the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium, for instance, employees will return to wearing full P.P.E., as they did this spring, if the virus is reported in the surrounding county, said Dr. Justin Rosenberg, an associate veterinarian at the zoo. After the spring surge, combined with more than two years of coronavirus-related precautions, there is definite 'preparedness fatigue,' Dr. Rosenberg acknowledged. But the zoo is eager to protect its avian charges, which include flamingos, ostriches and a 3-year-old duck with 'one of the best names that I have encountered,' Dr. Rosenberg said.

A compulsory housing order for all poultry and captive birds in Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of Essex came into force on Wednesday. It applies to everyone who keeps birds—both commercial flock keepers and non-commercial premises such as back yards, hobby flocks or pets. It comes after a significant increase in bird flu cases in the east of England region, with 27 outbreaks in the past month alone across the three counties. Christmas goose producers are among those to have been badly affected. The UK’s chief vet, Christine Middlemiss, said she expected to see the number of bird flu cases on farms to continue to rise over the coming months as migratory birds return to the UK. In the past month there have also been outbreaks in Somerset, Oxford, Staffordshire, North Yorkshire, Lancashire, Devon and Cheshire. In November last year, the chief veterinary officers for Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland agreed to bring in a compulsory housing order across the UK. This was only lifted by the chief vets from the four devolved nations in May this year. Farming groups are calling on for the new regional compulsory housing order to be extended across the whole of the UK as soon as possible. The sheer persistence of avian influenza over the past year, coupled with soaring energy and feed costs, has put the whole British poultry sector under huge emotional and financial pressure. Given the recent rise in avian influenza cases and the distress they cause for farming families, the implementation of housing measures in the east of England is a necessary step. The number one priority for poultry farmers has always been the health and welfare of their flock. That is why the National Farmers Union is now urging the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to consider expanding the regional housing measures on a national basis to reflect any increase in the levels of risk across the country,” said NFU poultry board chair James Mottershead. The British Poultry Council said a compulsory housing order for all farmed birds was necessary as soon as possible to prioritise the wellbeing of our farmers, the viability of their businesses and the safety of all birds. UK egg producers also said they would like to see the initial compulsory housing order extended across the UK. Free-range egg producers said their support was conditional on the UK aligning with EU proposals to allow eggs to continue to be labelled as “free range,” even if the birds are not allowed outside. The European Commission has put forward plans for scrapping the time limit on the marketing of eggs as free range if chickens are forced to be housed to reduce the risk of outbreaks of bird flu. Over the last year, the UK has faced its largest ever outbreak of bird flu with more than 160 cases confirmed since late October 2021. “We’ve been seeing unprecedented levels of the virus around the UK this year, and usually numbers increase as winter approaches, so the situation could get even worse,” said Prof Wendy Barclay, head of the department of infectious disease at Imperial College London. “The outbreak is being closely monitored by the Animal and Plant Health Agency and Defra, but it is clear that farmed birds that are exposed to wild birds are vulnerable,” she added. Defra said any decision on when to reintroduce national housing measures would be based on the latest scientific and ornithological evidence and veterinary advice.

The presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 was confirmed by Wales' interim chief veterinary officer, Gavin Watkins, at the site. It is the first confirmed case of avian influenza in Wales since 1 October. UK health agencies have advised that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and food standards agencies have said bird flu poses a very low food safety risk. A 3km protection zone and 10km surveillance zone have been declared around the infected premises to limit the risk of the disease spreading, the Welsh government said. It added that bird movements and gatherings are restricted within these zones and all holdings that keep birds must be declared. Bird keepers have been urged to remain vigilant and ensure they have high levels of biosecurity in place. Farmers are advised to consult a vet in the first instance if birds become unwell and if avian influenza is suspected it must legally be reported to the Animal and Plant Health Agency. Earlier this week, compulsory housing measures for all poultry and captive birds in Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of Essex were introduced after a decision by the UK's chief veterinary officer.

(AP) — Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium has closed several exhibits and taken other precautions after one of its pelicans died from the bird flu. The zoo said one of its pink-backed pelicans that died on Thursday tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza. A second pelican became ill Friday and was euthanized. As a precaution, the zoo has closed its Lied Jungle, Desert Dome and Simmons Aviary exhibits to the public for at least 10 days. The Omaha zoo was one of many across the country that closed down its aviaries and moved birds inside whenever possible to help protect them from avian influenza that is primarily spread by the droppings of wild birds. The zoo reopened its aviary in June after bird flu cases waned, but some cases continued to be reported across the country throughout the summer, and the outbreak has started to make a resurgence this fall. More than 47 million chickens and turkeys have been slaughtered in 42 states to limit the spread of bird flu during this year's outbreak. Officials order entire flocks to be killed when the virus is found on farms. More than 6 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered last month to limit the spread of the disease. The Omaha zoo also took precautions to protect its birds by limiting staff access to them and requiring workers to clean their shoes before entering areas where the birds are kept. The zoo said its pelicans live outside, so they do come into contact with wild birds. But the pelicans don't come into contact with other zoo birds and no other birds in the zoo's collection have shown symptoms of bird flu. \"It is very important that Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium immediately tighten our protocols to protect our birds and guard against any potential spread of avian influenza,\" Sarah Woodhouse, the zoo's director of animal health, said in a statement. \"This is important both to prevent infection of other zoo birds, and to prevent the virus from being dispersed off zoo grounds.\" Unlike on farms, zoos are generally allowed to isolate and treat an infected bird as long as they take precautions to protect the other birds in their collections. Health officials emphasize that bird flu doesn't jeopardize food safety because infected birds aren't allowed into the food supply and properly cooking meat and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.

The United States is in the midst of a months-long avian influenza outbreak that experts have said is the most severe since 2015, when a 'highly pathogenic' strain of the disease affected more than 49 million birds. The Department of Agriculture called it 'the most costly animal health emergency' in its history. Blake said she suspects the outbreak of avian influenza at the farm was spread by throngs of wild Egyptian geese, a type of aquatic bird known as waterfowl, who routinely fly in 'under the cover of darkness.' She said she believes they spread the disease among the domesticated birds there. 'The virus hit them extremely hard and very quickly,' Blake wrote on Twitter as she described the extent of her family farm's loss: 'Every single' chicken, duck, goose, female black swan and turkey at the farm died in just three days. Emmanuel's videos have reached millions of people on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter. Blake and a puppet of Emmanuel were featured on 'The Tonight Show' with Jimmy Fallon in July, and Knuckle Bump Farms began to sell merchandise with the emu's face on it. Now, Blake wants to use what happened to her farm to raise awareness about the disease. She said she is 'dedicated' to ensuring that Emmanuel survives it, describing a sling she and girlfriend Kristian Haggerty built so the emu could 'start physical therapy.' In a video posted late Saturday, Emmanuel appeared alert, at one point looking straight into the camera as Blake showered kisses on his head. Avian influenza is a viral disease that typically spreads from wild birds to domesticated birds through bodily fluids, including saliva and feces. In its highly pathogenic form, it is extremely infectious and deadly and cannot be treated. The virus affects birds differently: Some are simply found dead with no signs of illness, while in others, it can lead to neurological damage, including seizures, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. While experts say the risk of it spreading from birds to humans is low, it can happen and can cause severe illness or death. In April, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that a person in Colorado involved 'in the culling (depopulating) of poultry with presumptive H5N1 bird flu' had tested positive for the virus, experienced symptoms and then recovered. It said the health risk to the general population remains low. The current outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza began in January 2022 in Canada and is believed to have spread from Europe. Wild birds migrating to the United States are thought to have brought the virus to dozens of states, including, for the first time, Florida, where the outbreak has been 'unprecedented,' the commission said. Blake said Saturday that she had been in contact with Florida officials, who she said told her that standing water left behind by Hurricane Ian, which battered the state in late September, had 'made the virus run rampant.' Florida wildlife officials could not be immediately reached for comment early Sunday. Various studies have shown that the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza spreading increases with proximity to contaminated bodies of water. In a previous interview with The Post, Blake described how she began posting videos with the animals at Knuckle Bump Farms in 2018 to entertain and educate people about farm life. The first time Emmanuel interrupted her as she was filming a video on the farm, Blake was irritated and didn't post it. About a month later, she was re-watching the video on her phone and thought the interruption was funny. 'I just posted it, not thinking anything of it,' she said at the time. It 'completely spiraled from there.' Blake said Emmanuel has a genuine 'obsession with the camera' and with her. 'No matter where I am, he always has to be right next to me.' Soon after Blake posted about Emmanuel's condition on Twitter, messages of support began to pour in from well-wishers who have grown to love Emmanuel and his relentless pursuit of his owner's cellphone. 'DONT YOU DARE DO IT Emmanuel Todd Lopez. You are the king of birds and YOU WILL SURVIVE!!!,' one said, using Emmanuel's full name and echoing Blake's standard rebuke for the rebel bird. 'We love you Emmanuel! You were put on this earth to bring joy to the world,' one wrote.

Blake is looking for an avian specialist who can treat Emmanuel, who has suffered nerve damage in his right leg and foot, according to the Twitter thread. In the meantime, Blake posted a photo to Twitter of her helping Emmanuel start physical therapy using a homemade sling. Blake announced on Monday she is not looking to do any interviews with news outlets, tweeting, \"As much as I appreciate news stations reporting and elevating Emmanuel's story, the last thing on my mind right now is doing interviews.

Scientists believe wild migratory birds brought the virus to North America at the beginning of the year and have spread the virus to more than 40 wild bird species. While chickens and turkeys with the virus quickly die, some waterfowl with the virus can remain healthy and carry it long distances. The flu strain historically has posed almost no risk to humans, but public experts remain concerned about the possibility that it could jump across species. \"Because humans have no prior immunity to these viruses typically, if they were to be infected and spread the virus to other humans, then we could have another pandemic virus on our hands,\" Todd Davis, an expert on animal-to-human diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told NPR earlier this year.

The emu, named Emmanuel, racked up millions of views on TikTok over the summer after it pecked and dropped a phone while owner Taylor Blake filmed a video about life on the farm. In other TikTok clips, the brown-eyed bird walks into shots, approaches the camera and gets a scolding from Ms. Blake. 'Emmanuel!,' she shouted in a July video with more than 9.6 million views. 'Don't choose violence today!' But last week, Emmanuel wasn't eating or drinking on his own and lying down, according to Ms. Blake's tweets. On Sunday, she said he was drinking water on his own again. A video posted on Twitter showed the emu in a sling drinking water out of a bucket. 'Please keep the prayers coming!,' Ms. Blake tweeted. In a series of tweets Monday morning, Ms. Blake said Emmanuel appeared to have nerve damage in his right leg and a twist in his neck. Ms. Blake didn't respond to a request for comment Monday. She said in a tweet that she isn't doing interviews. 'My best friend is fighting for his life, and I'm just doing my absolute best not to crumble into a million pieces,' she said. Wild geese visited the farm last week and transmitted the deadly virus, Ms. Blake said on Twitter. 'We would chase them off, and they would return under the cover of darkness,' she said. More than 50 birds died in three days on the property, called Knuckle Bump Farms, including all of the farm's chickens, ducks, geese, black swans and turkeys. Three other emus, named Elliot, Eliza and Emily, also died. 'The virus hit them extremely hard and very quickly,' she tweeted. 'I tried my best to save them, but I was unsuccessful.' Avian flu, also known as bird flu, can be spread by wild birds that show no signs of illness, according to the Agriculture Department. As they migrate, they can infect domestic birds in backyards and farms. More than 530 flocks in 42 states are confirmed to have had avian flu this year, according to the USDA. The virus has a mortality rate of more than 90% in chickens, often killing them within 48 hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Humans aren't typically infected with avian flu, though there have been rare cases of human infection, the CDC says. Over the weekend, Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium in Nebraska closed parts of its zoo for 10 days after a pelican died of avian flu.

{"id": "212", "title": "Avian flu carves deep into Thanksgiving turkey flock", "date": "2022-10-28", "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES - With Thanksgiving fast approaching, turkey farmers from California to Pennsylvania are watching in horror as a virulent new strain of avian influenza wipes out their flocks, killing birds practically overnight and forcing hundreds of thousands more to be euthanized to prevent further infection. The rampant spread of the virus has already eliminated more than 6 million turkeys nationwide, about 14 percent of the nation's total turkey production, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. It is leaving farmers short of their usual offerings and pushing up prices for those that remain, forcing consumers already walloped by inflation to pay an additional 20 percent or more per pound for Thanksgiving turkeys compared with prices last year, according to several estimates. \"It's devastating,\" said Heidi Diestel, whose family has operated the Diestel Family Turkey Ranch in Sonora, Calif., for four generations. The ranch lost more than 150,000 turkeys in August after avian influenza infected one of its flocks. Although they still have several other healthy flocks of turkeys on separate farms, Diestel said certain turkey varieties they have been accustomed to selling, such as their \"petite\" brand that are only six to 10 pounds, were pretty much wiped out. \"It was really a sad time to see that many birds pass to something that was that aggressive and that uncontrollable,\" Diestel said. \"It definitely did impact our availability and supply, and we won't have everything for everyone like we normally do; we just won't.\" Diestel's story is far from unique in California or the nation as farmers and wildlife specialists confront what is shaping up as the deadliest avian flu outbreak in the nation's history. In California alone, seven turkey farms have been hit, resulting in some 485,000 birds killed by the virus or subsequently killed to stem the spread. The virus largely originates with wild birds, which can infect all kinds of poultry via their droppings when they fly over farms. But turkeys seem uniquely vulnerable, according to California State Veterinarian Annette Jones. As hundreds of millions of wild birds migrate southward across North America in the fall, broilers and laying hens can be stowed indoors in barns out of harm's way. Many turkeys are pasture raised, without indoor accommodations for all those big birds; it could also be that the virus has mutated in such a way that turkeys are a better host, Jones said. Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation, said there has already been a run on turkeys, with California sellers committing all available product to supermarkets or other customers. \"I get a lot of calls from politicians and others who want to donate birds to charity,\" Mattos said. \"I tell them, 'I can get you chickens. I can't get you turkeys.'\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the virus poses a negligible health threat to humans. Only one confirmed human infection has been reported thus far, and that was someone who was working closely with stricken fowl. But for birds, this year's avian flu outbreak is on track to surpass the outbreak in 2015, when 50.5 million birds died in what was then the nation's worst animal-health event. The USDA says 44.6 million birds - including more than 6 million turkeys - have died from the virus or been \"depopulated\" due to exposure so far this year. Spring was especially rough for laying hens, and then a slowing of infection during the summer caused many farmers and agricultural experts to think the danger had passed. But it picked back up again in September and October with especially devastating effects for the country's 2,500 turkey farms - just in time for the holidays. \"I was hoping we wouldn't be having this conversation, but we've seen a resurgence in the fall,\" said Courtney Schmidt, a protein sector analyst for Wells Fargo. \"The bottom line is you're going to be paying more for your Thanksgiving turkey.\" The big question for turkey farmers, Schmidt said, is what happens if the virus sticks around. As with the coronavirus, it is uncertain when or how the virus will play itself out - if it ever does. \"Experts are expecting this to evolve into something we have to deal with year-round, with it surviving in the warmer months in wild birds,\" Schmidt said. \"We are watching closely.\" Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer of the United States, said in a statement that the agency believes the virus \"will continue to infect wild birds and will bring an elevated risk to domestic birds, especially during migration seasons.\" She said it is critical for bird owners to \"maintain vigilance\" in keeping wild birds away from poultry and domestic birds. While both the 2015 virus and the 2022 virus were Eurasian lineage strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza, the reason for the dramatic uptick this fall is because this is a different subtype of the virus. Most avian flu viruses, including the one in 2015, were killed with the dry, hot temperatures in the summer. This year's subtype of the virus has been much more persistent in wild birds, so they are carrying it back with them as they migrate - something that happens in North America in the spring and in the fall. More than 85 percent of the cases this year can be traced to wild bird introductions, compared with about 30 percent of the cases in 2015, according to the USDA. This subtype is also adaptable to many species of birds and is living in waterfowl longer than the virus has in the past. While wild birds may carry it without becoming sick, infected domesticated chickens and turkeys may exhibit tremors, trouble breathing and extreme diarrhea followed by a swift death. The USDA has scrambled to educate poultry businesses about best practices and how to identify signs of illness, which experts say has a 90 to 100 percent mortality rate in turkeys and chickens within 48 hours. The virus kills so quickly that multiple dead or dying birds can be the first sign a flock is infected. Farmers take samples that are typically first sent to a state lab and then on to the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, for confirmation. A positive case triggers a public announcement, and the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service shows up to kill the affected flocks to prevent spread. This is necessary because of how extremely infectious the virus is. The agency says its goal is to kill infected flocks within 24 to 48 hours of diagnosis, often using carbon dioxide or a water-based foam, the consistency of firefighting foam, that flows up and over, suffocating birds in seven to 15 minutes. In May, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack approved $400 million to directly support the response efforts and to pay affected poultry farms. Additionally, some poultry farmers have avian flu disease insurance. But the ordeal, including costly cleanup, can mean catastrophic losses, which often are not entirely covered by USDA payouts, according to Beth Breeding, spokeswoman for the National Turkey Federation. Wells Fargo analyst Schmidt said going into this fall, U.S. turkey production was already down quite a bit, with third-quarter production down 11 percent from a year ago. She said higher feed and fuel costs, labor shortages and other head winds have caused some contraction in the industry, which will further impact price. Exports are down 21 percent this year and imports are up, she said, which may improve availability a bit heading into the holidays. That may be cold comfort for the farmers who are on the front lines watching the virus do its worst. \"I just think there's a lot of compassion that should be had for the farmers across the country that are dealing with it,\" said Diestel, the California turkey farmer. \"If you're the farmer standing there looking at a perfectly healthy flock of birds and you think of a 99 percent mortality rate in the flock, it's devastating.\"", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "The big question for turkey farmers, Schmidt said, is what happens if the virus sticks around.

{"id": "214", "title": "Bird flu infects Iowa egg farm with 1 million chickens", "date": "2022-10-31", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Iowa agriculture officials said Monday that another commercial egg farm in the state has been infected with bird flu, the first commercial farm case identified since April, when a turkey farm was infected. The latest case is in Wright County in north central Iowa about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Des Moines housing about 1.1 million chickens. Iowa has had 15 commercial farms infected this year, including turkeys, egg-laying hens and other chickens. In addition, five backyard flocks have been infected. Because the virus is highly contagious, all birds on an infected farm are killed and disposed of to avoid the spread of the disease. Iowa has been hardest hit with bird losses at more than 13.3 million this year before the latest farm was found infected. Nationally more than 47.7 million birds have been affected in 43 states that includes 251 commercial flocks and 328 backyard flocks, U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show. Most of the Iowa cases were during the spring migration of wild birds in March and April with one reported in early May. The virus hadn't been detected again until a backyard flock was infected on Oct. 20 and then the latest infection was confirmed on Monday. Federal and state agriculture officials had been concerned that it could return with the fall migration of wild birds, which often carry the virus but aren't sickened by it. The virus can spread through droppings or the nasal discharge of an infected bird, which can contaminate dust and soil. \"We have been preparing for the possibility of additional outbreaks and are working closely with USDA and producers to eradicate this disease from our state,\" said Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig. \"With migration ongoing, we continue to emphasize the need for strict biosecurity on poultry farms and around backyard flocks to help prevent and limit the spread of this destructive virus.\" Eds: UPDATES: Links audio.

It's the second case of highly pathogenic avian influenza this fall, likely sparked by millions of migrating birds that can carry the deadly virus. Earlier this month, officials reported a positive test in a Dallas County backyard flock with 48 birds. It was the first reported outbreak in Iowa since May 2. Avian influenza continues to be a significant threat across the country, said Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig in a statement.

{"id": "217", "title": "Warning of possible egg shortage as UK farmers struggle with avian flu", "date": "2022-11-08", "fulltext": "Reduced flock sizes and rising costs put pressure on supplies but retailers say they are working to minimise impact. British egg producers are warning of possible shortages, as farmers leave the industry or reduce the size of their flocks in the face of spiralling costs and uncertainty sparked by the spread of bird flu. A third of farmers surveyed in recent days by the trade body the British Free Range Egg Producers Association (BFREPA) reported they had reduced the number of hens in their flock because egg prices meant they were unable to cover their costs. Meanwhile, a quarter of the 165 farmers who responded told the BFREPA they had stopped production either temporarily or permanently. Farmers have been grappling with soaring costs, including the price of feed for their hens, as well as higher energy and transport bills. The association represents about 550 egg businesses, who account for about 70% of the UK's free range and organic egg production, supplying the country's largest retailers. Several of those surveyed who had reduced their flock said they were 'seriously considering not restocking' while another farmer added 'trying to cut costs to survive.' In March, the egg industry called on the UK's big retailers to increase the price of a dozen eggs by 40p to prevent the collapse of hundreds of egg producers. The BFREPA said the average price of eggs had since increased by about 45p, but only a quarter of that 'between 9p and 10p' had been passed on to farmers, which was not enough to cover their higher costs. The egg industry body, the British Egg Industry Council, said cost pressures had led to a temporary reduction in the size of the British flock, but it expected numbers to increase again as cost pressures ease. It said the pressure on egg supply had been caused by several factors: 'These include hens lost as a result of avian flu; cost of production rises, which mean that producers are struggling to break even; a reduction in the number of colony hens as retailers move towards cage free; and strong demand from consumers.' The council added the industry was working closely with retailers to ensure that producers can meet consumer demand. The Guardian understands that supermarkets are not facing immediate egg shortages. Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers were managing their supply chains and continuing to 'work hard to ensure minimal impact to customers despite ongoing supply chain pressures.' The cost pressures come as producers are coping with the UK's largest-ever outbreak of avian influenza, raising concerns about reduced output. Keeping hens indoors also leads to additional costs for farmers. The outbreak, which has been running for more than a year, has accelerated in recent weeks, with nearly 100 confirmed cases of bird flu H5N1 since the start of October. Officials have said the disease circulates among wild birds, but it is deadly for captive birds including hens and turkeys. Any outbreak is also devastating for farmers as it prompts a cull of any remaining birds on site. In an attempt to curb the spread of avian influenza, poultry and other captive birds in England are required by law to be housed indoors for an indefinite period. A prolonged housing order may also lead to free range eggs having to be relabelled for sale. UK law states that eggs can still be marketed as free range for the first 16 weeks of a housing order; if the hens are still required to be kept indoors after that time, the eggs will need to be relabelled as 'barn eggs.'", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The outbreak, which has been running for more than a year, has accelerated in recent weeks, with nearly 100 confirmed cases of bird flu H5N1 since the start of October.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Officials have said the disease circulates among wild birds, but it is deadly for captive birds including hens and turkeys.", "affirm_why_count": 2, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "The cost pressures come as producers are coping with the UK's largest-ever outbreak of avian influenza, raising concerns about reduced output.", "affirm_keywords_statement_3": "In an attempt to curb the spread of avian influenza, poultry and other captive birds in England are required by law to be housed indoors for an indefinite period.", "affirm_keywords_count": 2, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_statement_1": "Officials have said the disease circulates among wild birds, but it is deadly for captive birds including hens and turkeys.", "deny_why_count": 1, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "218", "title": "Egg swaps: a guide to plant-based alternatives amid UK avian flu crisis", "date": "2022-11-08", "fulltext": "Scrambled tofu, chickpea meringues and sweet potato cakes are healthier and cheaper substitutes UK supermarkets have declared an egg crisis as a result of avian flu and the summer heatwave, but those who want their regular fix of eggy options don't have to suffer. The solutions that supermarkets have mooted so far include egg rationing and higher prices, but there is another alternative that vegan chefs have been recommending for years: plant-based substitutes. Eggs are an important ingredient because they serve multiple purposes in cooking and baking. They provide richness, structure and texture, as well as emulsifying and binding. They're also a good source of protein and vitamins. There are lots of effective substitutes that can enable consumers to avoid the egg shortage, as well as providing health benefits, reducing carbon emissions and eliminating the negative impact on animal welfare of industrial farming. Alexis Gauthier, who runs Michelin-starred vegan restaurant Gauthier Soho, says in classical French cooking, egg use is split into whites and yolks. Egg whites, which are high protein and react easily to heat, are used for binding ingredients together and setting, while yolks are high in fat and cholesterol so they add creamy smooth richness to dishes. Here are the egg swaps the chefs recommend. Breakfast One of the best known replacements for eggs in vegan cooking is the tofu scramble, which has a similar texture to scrambled egg, although it is usually mixed with spices to boost flavour. At Gauthier's casual restaurant 123V, he uses silken tofu to recreate scrambled eggs, adding turmeric for colour and kala namak, a black Himalayan salt readily available in south Asian supermarkets which has a subtle sulphurous aroma that resembles the taste of egg. Roxy Pope, co-founder of So Vegan, says tofu is a fantastic source of protein and calcium while fortified plant-based milks can be added to create a runnier texture and incorporate vitamin B12. Bettina Campolucci Bordi, a plant-based chef, says you can also experiment with texture by choosing silken or firm tofu. She recommends trying a chickpea scramble by squishing half a tin of chickpeas and leaving the remainder whole for texture, and cooking up with vegetables and a tomato sauce. In the mornings, she also makes a chickpea omelette out of gram flour, bicarbonate of soda and apple cider vinegar, served with seasonal vegetables quick, easy and much cheaper than eggs. Burgers, patties and fritters These dishes all use egg as a binder to stop the ingredients falling apart when they're being fried. The chefs recommend instead using a flax egg which is made of ground flaxseeds soaked in water until they become gelatinous. Ben Pook, co-founder of So Vegan, suggests combining this with oats and chickpea flour, which soak up moisture and prevent patties falling apart. Flaxseeds are also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which improve heart health. Cakes and baking Eggs make cakes taste rich and moist, but there are lots of hacks vegan bakers use that you can try. Valentina Fois, who runs Lele's vegan food consultancy, uses a ripe banana or chia seeds in her cakes, while Campolucci Bordi says any puree will work, including sweet potato, carrot or apple. Adding a dash of apple cider vinegar will make baked goods fluffier. Aquafaba, the juice from a tin of chickpeas, is commonly used as an alternative to egg whites, although results can differ. Pope uses them for meringues, but warns they won't stay as crispy for long, so should be eaten quickly. Food influencer Samah Lakha makes a chocolate mousse using aquafaba instead of egg whites, although she says it is a better substitute for texture than taste. Coconut milk, cashew butter and vanilla combined with maple syrup for sweetness will help dial up the richness, and can make an effective vegan custard thanks to the ingredients' high fat content, she adds. Fine dining If you want to experiment with fine dining techniques, Gauthier uses potato protein to recreate egg white he recommends Sosa's products in dishes such as macaroons. Instead of egg yolks, he uses pea protein bought from Yumgo in combination with rapeseed oil and rice flour to create curds, shortbreads and creamy sauces.", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "219", "title": "Bird flu is a huge problem now but we�re just one mutation away from it getting much worse", "date": "2022-11-09", "fulltext": "If the H5N1 virus jumps into the human population and more dangerous strains emerge, it could set off a new pandemic. Lockdowns are a horrible experience, but fortunately one that is in the past now. Unless, that is, you're a domestic bird in Britain. Since 7 November, a UK directive has instructed all farmers to keep their birds indoors as part of a stringent measure to stop the spread of avian flu, or the H5N1 virus. This measure is intended to avoid infection of domestic birds from wild birds, and will result in tens of millions of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys being brought inside for the foreseeable future. We've also seen island birds affected, resulting in the shutdown of human visitors to the Isle of May in Scotland for five weeks, among other measures. Avian flu is known as one of the most infectious diseases: the R number, which was often discussed for the spread of Covid-19, can be as high as 100 for avian flu, meaning one bird can infect as many as 100 others. And the past few months have seen exponential spread of the virus, with Britain and Europe hit especially hard. A lab in Surrey that tests samples says it has seen a 600% increase in cases in the past three months. Why is this outbreak causing concern not just among scientists but also poultry farmers and government officials? Currently, avian flu outbreaks have been limited in humans because the virus doesn't spread easily between us. But this is a ticking timebomb. A mutation that makes this virus circulate more easily between humans is possible. This would be a gamechanger and raise the risk to humans considerably. And the more chances the virus has to jump into a human and mutate, the more likely it is a dangerous strain will emerge that could set off the next pandemic. While humans have been infected by birds, they are usually workers on poultry farms and those in close contact with infected birds, and even these instances have been rare. For example, on 3 November, two farm workers in Spain tested positive; it was the second known infection of humans in Europe since 2003. Infection is usually through handling sick or dead birds. Infected birds have the flu virus in their saliva, blood, mucus and faeces, and humans can get infected if they get this virus into the eyes, nose or mouth, or inhale droplets in close range (you can't get infected with avian flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs). And this virus is not mild. The fatality rate is thought to be high in humans: the World Health Organization estimate is roughly 60% for H5N1. We currently have no vaccine to use in humans; nor does the seasonal flu vaccine work against avian flu. But while the chance of human transmission is a future worry, right now the virus is affecting people's livelihoods and farms, and putting hundreds of millions of domestic and wild birds in danger. Outbreaks in chickens can kill the entire local population; in other birds, such as ducks and geese, the disease is often mild or even asymptomatic. Ducks have even been called the 'Trojan horses' for the virus, given their ability to carry it and infect others while remaining unaffected themselves. Bird flu is highly infectious and poses a high risk to chickens and turkeys. As a result, if a farm tests positive for bird flu, the entire flock is culled. This can lead to hundreds of thousands to millions of pounds in lost income, and places enormous strain on poultry farms. It also has implications for the price and availability of turkeys and chickens going into Thanksgiving and Christmas. And, of course, it is a tremendous loss of bird life. The heart of the issue is how we raise and treat animals, and their interactions with humans. Poultry are often kept in difficult conditions where they are packed into close quarters and diseases easily pass through them. Some experts think that this more infectious strain developed in an industrial factory environment, where animals are kept in close quarters and viruses have the chance to circulate and mutate. And this is not just an issue with avian flu, but other infectious diseases as well. In places such as China and India, antibiotics are freely given to animals in order to prevent infection (especially in industrial farming) and to make them as large as possible. A survey of chicken farmers in China found that they all used antibiotics. The rationale here is cheap and fast meat to meet the growing demand in emerging economies. But this creates its own problems. Feeding antibiotics to animals can lead to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, and then humans such as farmers becoming infected with antibiotic-resistant infections. These then circulate in humans and reduce the effectiveness of one of the most powerful drugs in modern medicine. Chemotherapy, infections and surgeries of all kinds have become safer because of antibiotics. If the drugs don't work, these procedures become high-risk and life-threatening, as they used to be in the pre-antibiotic era. And as we've learned, all it takes is for a person to get on a plane with a novel infectious disease for it soon to become a problem for everywhere else in the world. The major infectious disease threats in humans tend to come from animals: think of Sars-CoV-2, Sars, Mers, Ebola — the list goes on. There are more than a million viruses circulating in the animal kingdom, and it would be a fool's errand to try to stop that circulation. But we can limit the chances these have to jump into the human population, and limit their circulation in domestic animals. This requires taking the animal-human interface seriously, and knowing that while it's a major economic, animal welfare and farming problem now, the situation becoming even worse is just a mutation away. * Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate of roughly 60% for H5N1 according to the World Health Organization estimate.

{"id": "221", "title": "Avian flu set to deal killer blow to turkey farmers at Christmas", "date": "2022-11-12", "fulltext": "Hard-hit producers who have lost tens of thousands of pounds after culling stock now fear they may not be able to continue. It is eerily silent on Steve Childerhouse's poultry farm near Attleborough in Norfolk. At this time of year, he'd usually be working flat out, feeding his turkeys and geese for the busy Christmas period. But this year the sheds are empty, after avian influenza hit his farm in late September, wiping out all of his 11,000 free-range turkeys and 2,500 geese destined for local festive dinner tables. In one fell swoop, a bird flu outbreak has devastated the 51-year-old's livelihood. After almost 40 years—he started raising geese as a boy—Childerhouse is still coming to terms with the loss. 'I wouldn't wish it on anybody,' he says, recalling how quickly the infection spread through his flock. He believes the disease was brought to his farm by wild birds, who initially passed it on to his geese. The highly infectious bird flu that has been sweeping across Britain for more than a year now, and gained pace in recent weeks, is deadly for farmed animals such as turkeys and geese. However, any outbreak is also catastrophic for the farmers, as any remaining birds on the site have to be culled. At present the disease doesn't pass easily from birds to humans. 'I've never seen anything like it and I don't want to see it ever again,' Childerhouse says. 'We had taken these birds from day-old chicks.' He is reeling not just from the financial hit, but from the emotional rollercoaster of dealing with bird flu, which he likens to grief. After the cull, he had to inform all the local butchers and farm shops that usually sell his birds, and warn all of his regular workers that he would not be able to offer them much-needed seasonal jobs this year. It's the Covid of poultry, except that turkeys and other poultry don't get sick and recover; they just die. Paul Kelly, farmer Childerhouse has already decided he won't go back into rearing geese, and in the meantime is looking for work elsewhere. The UK's worst-ever outbreak of bird flu has prompted fears about the availability of British turkeys and geese this Christmas. The newly appointed farming minister, Mark Spencer, told the Observer it would be 'quite a challenge' for consumers to get hold of a British goose 'because there's been such devastation in the sector.' He insisted, however, that there should be enough turkeys to go around, thanks to robust supply chains. Nearly 9 million turkeys are eaten in the UK each Christmas, of which about 90% are British, according to the British Poultry Council. The sector relies on seasonal supply to rear, slaughter and process birds in time for all of those festive meals. The industry body says the free-range sector has taken the biggest hit from bird flu, with about 35% of producers—which between them rear more than a million birds each year—directly affected. There have been 100 confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in England since the start of October. The outbreak has now been running for more than a year, since October 2021, and in that time there have been more than 230 cases. It has led, so far, to the culling of 3.5m birds on UK farms and piled pressure on Britain's egg producers, at a time when soaring energy and feed costs are causing many to leave the sector. Bird flu cases usually drop during the summer months, but that did not happen this year. The disease has been most acute in East Anglia, especially Childerhouse's home county of Norfolk. It is currently spreading northwards and westwards, with several confirmed cases in Lincolnshire, Cheshire and North Yorkshire, and also north Wales and Anglesey. This wave of avian influenza is also spreading around Europe. Experts suspect the illness is now endemic in wild birds, creating a year-round risk of infection. There is as yet no available vaccine against bird flu. At the end of last month, among other measures, the government ordered that all poultry and other captive birds in England be housed indoors. This was an extension of the housing order that had been in place in Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of Essex since mid-October. However, many in the poultry industry believe this move came too late. They had been calling for several weeks for a nationwide poultry housing order after an upsurge in outbreaks. More cases on farms are expected as more migratory birds return to the UK for winter. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it had announced 'a package of support including quicker compensation packages, as well as stepping up biosecurity rules to minimise the risk of the disease spreading.' The package also included a change to the rules of the bird flu compensation scheme available to farmers: they are now eligible for compensation payments from the start, rather than the end, of a planned culling. And in a move designed to give them more certainty over business planning, poultry farmers are now allowed to slaughter their animals early and freeze them, so the birds can be defrosted and sold to consumers in the run-up to Christmas, labelled 'previously frozen.' Third-generation turkey farmer Paul Kelly has already started processing some of his birds, several weeks earlier than usual, to dodge rising bird flu cases. 'It's the Covid of poultry, except that turkeys and other poultry don't get sick and recover; they just die,' he says from his farm in Essex. 'I can honestly say this is the worst year I have had to deal with in my entire business career.' Kelly calls the government's compensation scheme 'not fit for purpose.' He lost 9,000 of his 65,000 Christmas turkeys after an outbreak of bird flu at one of his sites, although his premium KellyBronze birds were not affected. Unlike other livestock, under current legislation farmers are only compensated for the number of birds that are fit and healthy at the start of a bird flu cull. 'Our industry is saying this is many years out of date and isn't fit for purpose,' Kelly says. Hundreds of birds can succumb to the illness between the farm notifying the authorities of an outbreak, and officials arriving to start the cull. Poultry is an 'unsupported sector' according to Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers' Union. She warns that, with bird flu coming on top of 30% cost price inflation, farmers are struggling. 'We've got to make sure that we do not lose the critical mass of poultry producers, for eggs and meat,' Batters adds. 'We've got to take special action. We have severe market failure on the back of a disease. The compensation package has to be enough to give farmers the confidence to keep producing, because they are also facing inflationary costs.' Howard Blackwell is another Essex turkey farmer who finds himself literally and figuratively at a loss after a bird flu outbreak among his flock of 5,500 turkeys and 1,800 geese in early October. The 59-year-old introduced turkeys to the arable farm set up by his grandparents at Coggeshall, near Braintree, in 1983, as an extra source of income. But he estimates that he will have lost nearly £100,000 as a result of the outbreak, and is currently unclear how much compensation he will receive. His farm shop and wholesale meat business have been allowed to continue operating, but under stringent restrictions. Bird flu is not a one-season worry for Blackwell and other affected farmers.

Shoppers posting on social media have reported empty shelves at Tesco and Sainsbury's stores across the country. Currently, branches of Asda and Lidl are limiting customers to two boxes of eggs each, while other supermarkets are sourcing eggs from other countries, including Italy. The British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, said that it was impossible to tell how long the shortages would last or how bad they would become. Andrew Opie, the BRC's director of food and sustainability, added: \"While avian flu has disrupted the supply of some egg ranges, retailers are experts at managing supply chains and are working hard to minimise impact on customers.

When there is a confirmed outbreak on a poultry or egg farm, all the birds in the affected area are destroyed. This means that there are less chicken and fewer eggs in the supply chain, with egg supply particularly affected at the moment. Egg farmers have warned that the shortages are likely to worsen. The British Free Range Egg Producers Association said: \"Many of our members are losing money on every egg laid, and our data shows that even those who are making a small profit do not see a long-term future.

It is believed that the cub, which was located in Bartlett Cove in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve west of Juneau, is the second bear diagnosed with the highly pathogenic bird flu, the Juneau Empire reported. Bird flu passes really easily to poultry, but mammals aren’t really susceptible to it,” said Dr. Kimberlee Beckmen, a wildlife veterinarian for the department. “It’s difficult to get, but we suspect the cub probably ate a bird that died from avian influenza.” The bear likely became ill because it was a small, young animal with a weak immune system, she said. Since the virus was first detected in an adult female black bear in Canada in June, Alaska state officials have tested scavenging animals for it. So far, it’s only been found in two other animals, both red foxes in Dutch Harbor and the western Alaska community of Unalakleet. Finding bird flu in the bear and foxes is not an indication it’s likely to spread to other animals or to people, Beckmen said. “This particular strain, people are pretty much immune to it,” she said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this strain of bird flu poses a “very low” risk to humans, and only one person in the U.S. has been diagnosed in this outbreak. However, the flu has hammered the state’s wild bird population. People in Glacier Bay last month noticed that the cub, one of three accompanying a sow, had difficulty walking, according to state wildlife officials. The sow abandoned the cub and a biologist picked it up. However, it began suffering seizures, as did the Canadian bear previously diagnosed with the illness. The Alaska bear was euthanized by a state biologist. Later testing confirmed the presence of the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza.

As the virus sweeps through commercial and backyard chicken and turkey flocks, agriculture officials are encouraging poultry producers to look out for signs of infection and report any cases to state or federal officials. Nebraska, where 6.8 million birds have been affected by the outbreak, is the second worst-hit state behind Iowa, where 15.5 million birds have been culled.

(AP) — Nebraska agriculture officials say another 1.8 million chickens must be killed after bird flu was found on a farm in the latest sign that the outbreak that has already prompted the slaughter of more than 50 million birds nationwide continues to spread. The Nebraska Department of Agriculture said Saturday that the state's 13th case of bird flu was found on an egg-laying farm in northeast Nebraska's Dixon County, about 120 miles (193 kilometers) north of Omaha, Nebraska. Just like on other farms where bird flu has been found this year, all the chickens on the Nebraska farm will be killed to limit the spread of the disease. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says more than 52.3 million birds in 46 states — mostly chickens and turkeys on commercial farms — have been slaughtered as part of this year's outbreak. Nebraska is second only to Iowa with 15.5 million birds killed with 6.8 million birds now affected at 13 farms. In most past bird flu outbreaks the virus largely died off during the summer, but this year's version found a way to linger and started to make a resurgence this fall with more than 6 million birds killed in September. The virus is primarily spread by wild birds as they migrate across the country. Wild birds can often carry the disease without showing symptoms. The virus spreads through droppings or the nasal discharge of an infected bird, which can contaminate dust and soil. Commercial farms have taken a number of steps to prevent the virus from infecting their flocks, including requiring workers to change clothes before entering barns and sanitizing trucks as they enter the farm, but the disease can be difficult to control. Zoos have also taken precautions and closed some exhibits to protect their birds. Officials say there is little risk to human health from the virus because human cases are extremely rare and the infected birds aren't allowed to enter the nation's food supply. Plus, any viruses will be killed by properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit. But the bird flu outbreak has contributed to the rising prices of chicken and turkey along with the soaring cost of feed and fuel. Eds: UPDATES: Links photo.

Numerous pelicans were found dead over the weekend along Venezuela's coast as the species arrived amid their annual winter migration. Other outbreaks among pelicans prompted bird flu alerts in Peru and Ecuador. Avian flu has been striking migratory birds across North America and in many other countries in recent months. The pelicans' bodies appeared on beaches and waterfronts, mangrove forests and up in the trees in the northwest state of Anzoátegui. Tests turned up positive cases of bird flu. As a preventative measure, the government imposed a 90-day quarantine on five states: Anzoátegui, Sucre, Nueva Esparta, Miranda and La Guaira. Agriculture Minister Wilmer Castro Soteldo suggested in a statement that the National Institute of Agricultural Health will work to avoid its spread to birds of other species, especially those eaten by humans. These rules prohibit moving live birds and fertile eggs from the quarantined states, and entire flocks that may have had contact with infected birds must be sacrificed, the statement said.

The infection risk to humans is low, but authorities recommend care be taken to minimize risk even further. Waterfowl hunters are encouraged to harvest birds that act and look healthy; avoid eating, drinking or smoking while handling harvested birds; wear disposable gloves while processing the birds; harvest birds outdoors or in a well-ventilated area and wash hands, utensils, and surface areas thoroughly after processing the birds.

{"id": "231", "title": "Avian flu has led to the killing of 140m farmed birds since last October", "date": "2022-12-09", "fulltext": "Culls and compensation have cost hundreds of millions of pounds in the US, UK and Europe, with current outbreak predicted to worsen More than 140 million birds have died and hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent in the past year in the US, UK and EU in tackling bird flu, as some experts said continual culling was 'morally' wrong. With an international agreement on the use of vaccinations likely to be one or two years away, the situation will probably worsen this winter as outbreaks of bird flu continue to rise. Globally, the disease and related culling has killed 140 million poultry since October 2021, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health. This includes almost 48 million birds in Europe and the UK combined and just over 53 million in the US. 'If an industry can only remain by culling millions of animals it is not sustainable,' said Arjan Stegeman, professor of veterinary medicine and epidemiologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Stegeman fears the next bird flu season may again be severe, suggesting culling will continue and there are similar concerns in the UK and US. Dr Christine Middlemiss, the UK's chief veterinary officer, said: 'We are seeing a growing number of bird flu cases. Unfortunately, we expect the number of cases to continue to rise over the coming months.' The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said although it cannot predict exactly what we will see in the coming months or years 'we believe it's important for people to plan for an elevated [avian flu] risk.' Costs and compensation in the US for this year's outbreak total almost $570m (£465m), the USDA said. An EU source, who preferred not to be named, said: 'According to the information provided, member states have spent about €240m (£208m) to combat avian influenza outbreaks.' Responding to a recent parliamentary question Defra said £2.48m has been paid to compensate for healthy birds culled due to avian flu since 1 October 2022. No compensation is paid for birds who get sick or die from avian flu. At least 4 million birds in the UK have been culled or died from bird flu during this outbreak. Protecting poultry by keeping them indoors and culling sick flocks are now the main bird flu control methods. Neither the USDA, EU or the UK government answered questions about the acceptability or morality of mass culling as a disease management tool. 'It is becoming almost normalised now that millions of birds are being culled, which is plain wrong,' said Dan Crossley, executive director of the the Food Ethics Council. Stegeman said the current scale of culling was 'unethical' but that culling was currently unavoidable because avian flu 'is really lethal for the flocks and 99% are going to die anyway.' Culling, however, will not stop the spread, he said. 'Twenty years ago, culling for avian flu was acceptable because it was rare and it made sense to cull birds because you also stopped the virus. Now we have the disease in wild birds so you can cull, but that's not going to help stop the spread of the virus. This is a human-made problem that has arisen in south-east Asia because the H5N1 avian flu virus was not controlled properly. It started in 1996 in China, where the duck and poultry [sector] expanded rapidly, and then it spilled over to wild birds.' According to Dr Steven McCulloch, a senior lecturer in human-animal studies at the University of Winchester, the muted nature of public concern was probably due to 'a lack of knowledge and awareness of the scale of culls, and a lack of visibility because compared to the burning pyres of cattle we had with the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001' the birds are kept in sheds. The president of the British Veterinary Association, Malcolm Morley, said culling was only acceptable because influenzas 'don't tend to become endemic [achieve constant presence in a community]; we tend to get outbreaks and then they die off.' In Italy, footage of a mass cull posted on the YouTube channel of animal charity Essere Animali appeared to show a botched operation in which live chickens were moved by digger into a container, before gases such as CO2, argon or nitrogen were added. 'The right method would be to fill the container with gas first then put the chickens in, so they die in a few seconds,' said Francesco Ceccarelli, the charity's investigations director. Containerised gassing is one of the UK's preferred culling options, along with whole-house gassing. Richard Webby, a virologist at St Jude Children's Research hospital who studies influenza in birds and other animals, said that although culls are a standard response in many countries, they were not 'the moral way forward in a context where bird flu is endemic in wild birds now.' Both Webby and Stegeman believe vaccines are needed, but they are controversial. 'We are not going to get rid of H5 [bird flu] by vaccination, but it will reduce the scale of the culling, we hope,' said Webby. Vaccination trials on commercial poultry are now under way in Europe, but there are, as yet, no international agreements on their use. The European Commission said it had asked the European Food Safety Authority to issue a new scientific opinion on vaccination against bird flu, which is expected to be available after summer 2023. The chicken industry is wary of trade restrictions damaging the poultry trade and suggest getting agreement on the use of vaccinations could take up to two years. The UK government said despite vaccines' ability to reduce mortality, disadvantages include the possibility of some vaccinated birds transmitting the disease without showing signs of sickness, making it harder to detect and eradicate the virus. The USDA said: 'At this time [vaccines] would have detrimental impacts on poultry trade while still necessitating response activities such as quarantine, depopulation, and surveillance testing.'

{"id": "232", "title": "Latest Iowa bird flu cases push December total near 700,000", "date": "2022-12-12", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) Four new cases of bird flu at Iowa turkey farms in the past few days will push the number of birds slaughtered nationwide this month to limit the spread of the virus up to nearly 700,000. The latest cases announced by the Iowa Department of Agriculture only add to the toll of this year's ongoing outbreak that has prompted officials to kill more than 53 million birds in 47 states. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock is killed to help control the disease. Iowa officials said the latest cases found since Friday involved 240,000 birds on turkey farms in Sac, Buena Vista, Cherokee and Ida counties all in the northwest corner of the state. Iowa leads all states with nearly 16 million chickens and turkeys slaughtered this year more than double the next closest state of Nebraska largely because it is the nation's largest egg producer and egg farms can include millions of chickens. Several other bird flu cases have been confirmed this month at other turkey farms in Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota and Missouri. An upland gamebird producer in Colorado also had to slaughter 18,000 birds to limit the spread of the virus. Experts believe the virus that causes bird flu is spread primarily by wild birds as they migrate across the country. The virus spreads easily through droppings or the nasal discharge of an infected bird, which can contaminate dust and soil and be carried onto farms on boots and clothing or on truck tires. Even though wild birds can often carry avian influenza without developing symptoms, the virus has killed a large number of eagles, vultures, ducks and other wild birds. Farmers take measures like requiring workers to change clothes before entering barns and sanitizing trucks as they enter the farm, but the disease is difficult to control. This year's outbreak is different than most past ones because the virus found a way to linger throughout the summer when warmer temperatures usually largely kill off the virus. The U.S. Department of Agriculture resumed reporting large numbers of birds infected in September when more than 6 million birds had to be killed. That was followed by another 2 million in October and nearly 4 million more in November. Bird flu doesn’t represent a significant threat to human health because human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation’s food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses. But the bird flu outbreak combined with the soaring cost of fuel and feed has driven up the prices of eggs, chicken and turkey.

Not only are prices up but the choice of fresh turkey is more limited in the major supermarkets, with the number of whole bird and crown options falling by about a third this year. This time last year consumers had 65 products to choose from but now that figure is 44, according to The Grocer magazine. Of the 27 like-for-like products available on both dates, all but one had seen a price rise of least 12%. The average price increase was 24.4% across this group, according to the report based on data from supermarket analysts Assosia. The biggest mover was a 45.3% increase for a Morrisons British large whole turkey to £1.44, followed by a 41.6% jump in the price of a Morrisons medium turkey to £3.45. The price of a 5kg M&S Collection organic free-range bronze turkey with giblets, sold via Ocado, saw the third-biggest rise, by 35.7% to £5. Frozen turkeys are also more expensive, with an average price increase of 18.1% for the 49 frozen lines available both this year and last. The biggest move was a 30.8% increase in the price of a Braemoor medium British turkey crown sold in Lidl, which rose from £2.99 to £6.99. Last month the British Poultry Council told a hearing of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee that of the total 8.5m to 9m turkeys produced each year for the festive period about 1.6m had already died of the disease or been culled.

{"id": "236", "title": "Egg Prices Surge to Records as Bird Flu Hits Poultry Flocks; While worst outbreak in U.S. history tightens supplies, grocers avert shortages", "date": "2022-12-22", "fulltext": "Egg prices are hitting records, driven by an avian-influenza outbreak that has killed tens of millions of chickens and turkeys this year across nearly all 50 states. Wholesale prices of Midwest large eggs hit a record $5.36 a dozen in December, according to the research firm Urner Barry. Retail egg prices have increased more than any other supermarket item so far this year, climbing more than 30% from January to early December compared with the same period a year earlier, and outpacing overall food and beverage prices, according to the data firm Information Resources Inc. For supermarkets, eggs are a staple product that most consumers pick up on trips to the grocery store, similar to milk and butter. To maintain store traffic, grocers said they have been sacrificing some profits on eggs to keep prices for consumers competitive. Some suppliers are projecting potential relief in price by February or March, but cold weather could hamper production in the near term, executives said. \"We are trying to keep eggs relatively accessible,\" said Dan O'Neill, director of center store and perishables at Angelo Caputo's Fresh Markets, a chain of eight stores in Illinois. Angelo Caputo's bought extra-large eggs for $5.09 a dozen recently, up from $1.30 at the start of the year, Mr. O'Neill said. The grocer has for months been selling eggs for slightly above cost, he said, as wholesale prices have increased. Grocery prices have continued to increase this year because of what companies have said are higher costs of labor, ingredients and logistics, helping supermarkets generate higher sales and profits. Those factors have propelled egg prices, too. As eggs get more costly, some supermarkets are selling more organic eggs that are sometimes less expensive than conventional varieties, while suppliers say consumer demand has remained steady despite higher prices. Cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have so far this year led to the deaths of about 58 million birds, the deadliest outbreak in U.S. history, according to Agriculture Department data. Entire poultry flocks are destroyed after an infection is confirmed, to help limit the outbreak's spread. More than 40 million egg-laying chickens have died in the current outbreak, according to USDA data, with the total supply of egg-laying chickens falling more than 5% to about 308 million from the start of January to December. Despite a tight egg supply and high prices, shortages are still a long way off, said Emily Metz, chief executive of the American Egg Board, which represents egg producers. Egg supplies have been more stable this year compared with the previous major U.S. avian-influenza outbreak, in 2015, she said, as the time it takes for farms to recover from an outbreak has shrunk to roughly three months from six to nine months. The current outbreak has largely been attributed to wild birds spreading the virus to farms as they migrate across the country, agriculture-industry officials have said. While the 2015 outbreak ended in June, cases this year continued to pop up throughout the fall. Food-industry officials said they fear the current outbreak could continue. \"There's definitely a lot of cause for concern,\" said Karyn Rispoli, who determines egg pricing at Urner Barry. Wholesale egg prices have been rising for nine consecutive weeks, according to Urner Barry. Strong demand has driven prices higher in recent months as people bake more and eat warmer breakfasts during cooler weather, Ms. Rispoli said, though some consumers are starting to buy less. Steve Schwartz, director of sales and marketing at Morton Williams Supermarkets in New York, said: \"Every week you get an egg quote, it's more and more.\" There aren't many substitutes for eggs, grocery executives said. Specialty eggs, such as organic eggs that are sold to retailers and distributors on a fixed-price basis, can be about $1 cheaper a dozen, but there are only so many available brands of eggs for operators to secure, they said. \"Some of those replacement products are just as rare or expensive,\" said Max Bowman, chief financial officer of the largest U.S. egg producer, Cal-Maine Foods Inc., at a November investor conference. KeHE Distributors has been trying to secure a wider variety of egg brands, as well as plant-based egg alternatives, said Jennifer Onoja, a senior category manager of dairy, nondairy and refrigerated beverages at the grocery distributor. Eggs cost the company 20% to 50% more this year. \"These are essential categories that are staples in your refrigerator,\" she said. After the major outbreak in 2015, the USDA upgraded its virus testing and detection systems, training and equipment, officials have said. Some farmers invested in new biosecurity systems for their barns meant to disinfect anyone who walks into the tightly sealed poultry houses. Despite the changes, farmers and USDA officials have struggled to halt this year's outbreak. \"All signs are pointing to that this will be something the industry has to deal with,\" said Ms. Metz of the American Egg Board. \"We continue to manage it and improve in how we manage it.\" Write to Jaewon Kang at jaewon.kang@wsj.com and Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com Egg Prices Surge to Records as Bird Flu Hits Poultry Flocks", "media_outlet": "WSJ", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The current outbreak has largely been attributed to wild birds spreading the virus to farms as they migrate across the country, agriculture-industry officials have said.", "affirm_why_count": 1, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "Egg supplies have been more stable this year compared with the previous major U.S. avian-influenza outbreak, in 2015, she said, as the time it takes for farms to recover from an outbreak has shrunk to roughly three months from six to nine months.", "affirm_keywords_count": 1, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

This is what I learned about the horrors of bird flu", "date": "2023-01-04", "fulltext": "In the past year, avian flu has ravaged colonies of seabirds in the UK. Gwen Potter, a National Trust countryside manager working on the Farne Islands, was among those who donned hazmat suits on the frontline. In May last year, our seabirds were starting to settle, having flown here from all over the world. It is an explosion of life, sound and smell and it looked as if it was going to be a really good year. On the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland, the most numerous bird is probably the puffin, we've also got a lot of guillemots, razorbills, kittiwakes, arctic terns, sandwich terns, common terns, loads of other fantastic seabirds. It's such a spectacle seeing all these birds fly in. The cliff-nesting birds are jostling for space, they're really crushed up against each other. You never take it for granted when you see the first birds coming back. Some have particular behaviours that you only see then. Kittiwakes, for example, do something called food begging. It's a display to their partner where they kind of fluff up their wings and go 'cheep cheep cheep' and show off their really bright throats. It is really cute. In a good year, we have 100,000 pairs. They start pairing up when they come back, and I always wonder if they were with the same partner last year; many of the species mate for life and might not have seen each other over winter. Humans don't belong everywhere, and this island is for birds. It is a privilege to be there and witness it. The first bird flu reports came in from north Scotland in May. It did make our ears prick up because it is not something we've seen before in our seabird colonies. Bird flu tends to thrive in cooler temperatures and isn't generally a problem during the summer, at least not in this country. Then it just started moving down the coast. We started to get really worried, as it got closer and closer. The razorbills went, then shags started to die. That was horrendous. One ranger saw a shag dead on its nest, chicks underneath. By the time it got to the Bass Rock off the coast of Edinburgh, we were hearing about gannets dying en masse. Then we saw one or two gannets on the Farne Islands, which you don't normally see. They were sitting on the edge looking out to sea. They didn't look right. It's hard to tell from a boat, but they looked ill. They probably came from the Bass. Initially, it was a couple of birds, and then a couple of days later, it was a lot. I went to the outer islands and saw an area of cliff usually covered in guillemots. There was one sitting there in the middle of it, and then just dead birds and rock. Some adults died where they were nesting, and there were lots of dead chicks, too. Whether they died of the disease or their parents died and they starved as a result, we don't know. I remember seeing one chick on its back, struggling with its little stubby wings helplessly flapping. The razorbills went, then shags started to die. That was horrendous. One of the rangers saw a shag dead on its nest with live chicks still underneath. We were thinking we must be able to do something about this, there must be some guidance, or some way to prevent it spreading, but everything was geared towards poultry farms. There was no information on wild birds. We were working in a highly ventilated environment so we found some PPE and decided we had to pick up the bodies to try to save as many of the live ones as possible. It would have been even harder to do nothing. Initially, we wondered: 'What do we do with the carcasses?' We couldn't bury them and didn't want to chuck them in the sea. In the end, we managed to get a company to come and collect and incinerate them. We figured that was the safest option, as we couldn't leave them. It was horrendous picking them up. It was really hot, and we were wearing hazmat suits with goggles. Some of them were not in good condition when we collected them, they were already rotting and smelt awful. In total, we picked up around 6,000 dead birds. We just couldn't keep up. What we collected was the tip of the iceberg. Going out to areas that we would never normally go to during the breeding season was shocking, too. I knew cliff nesters would be badly affected but I thought other birds such as fulmars and puffins might be OK because they tend to give themselves a bit more space, but they weren't. We found quite a few dead puffins, both adults and pufflings. The ones we found were those which were outside the burrow where they nest, we don't know how many were dead inside the burrow. I remember thinking that for the puffins to get it, it must be so virulent, so deadly. It is hard to describe. When you're watching a nest or tracking a nest, you realise each bird has its own personality, it is an individual with a life. Dare I say, a soul. It has its own agency. So when you see that bird that you've followed, struggling for life or dead, it's horrendous. There's nothing you can do to help, you know it's not going to recover and they don't die quickly. Often, sick birds gathered together in particular areas. On Brownsman, which is one of the outer group of islands, the sick kittiwakes would take themselves away from other birds and gather around a specific pond. All the birds sitting around that pond were dying. We saw hundreds of carcasses of birds washing up in the waves, too, including kittiwakes and guillemots, which must have died at sea. Picking up a tiny chick is horrible, because that chick has had no life. But then it is also horrible with an enormous gannet or a shag, they're hard to get into a bag. Whatever size or age a bird is, many of these birds have travelled across the globe to be here. The amount of things they have faced out there, and then they come to die, here, like this. We want to protect them and we can't. The biggest test of the impact will be how many come back next year and there is no sign of it going away. For the rangers, it can be psychologically really devastating. If it sweeps through again, I can't see how some populations are going to be able to recover. For the great skuas, they think it could be an extinction-level event. Some of these birds on the island exist in tiny numbers. The terns worry me in particular, but shags are red list, kittiwakes are red list, puffins are red list. Some of them are vulnerable on a global scale to extinction.

{"id": "238", "title": "UK free-range egg rules could be relaxed in line with EU for avian flu outbreaks", "date": "2023-01-04", "fulltext": "Ministers considering change that would class eggs laid by hens kept in barns for months under restrictions as free range Free-range egg rules in the UK could be relaxed in response to the European Union preparing to overhaul regulations after the biggest avian flu outbreak on record. Ministers are understood to be considering a change to the rules that would mean eggs laid by hens kept in barns for months on end could be classed as free range. Currently, eggs cannot be classed as free range if birds are indoors for more than 16 weeks. Farmers have that grace period in both the EU and UK, which means eggs can still be labelled as free-range if a government-issued housing order for birds is in place up to 16 weeks. Subsequently, labels need to be added to packaging making it clear that those are now classified as barn eggs. Whitehall sources told the Daily Telegraph that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is considering changing the regulations in order to keep farmers competitive with Europe. In 2022, the UK experienced its largest outbreak of bird flu and experts have warned that infections could rise even higher over the winter. The outbreak has led to the death of 97 million birds globally, and 3.8 million in the UK, according to government data in November. In October, poultry producers from as far north as Norway's Svalbard islands to southern Portugal collectively reported almost 2,500 outbreaks of the disease since last year. In the event that proposed changes to EU regulations are adopted, farmers in the bloc would be able to continue labelling eggs as free-range during avian flu outbreaks even if chickens had been kept indoors for more than 16 weeks. The European Commission put forward a proposal in September, which stated 'where temporary restrictions have been imposed on the basis of EU legislation, eggs may be marketed as free-range notwithstanding that restriction.' The proposal, which is awaiting approval by the European parliament, means eggs could be classed as free range even if hens are forced to spend months indoors due to government rulings. In September, egg producers in the UK said it was essential that the government now followed suit to avoid British suppliers being undercut by EU imports. Robert Gooch, chief executive of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association, said at the time: 'It's very necessary that the UK aligns with the EU, otherwise retailers will import eggs labelled as free range from housed hens in the EU in the event of an AI epidemic when there are none on the UK market.' In past years, outbreaks of avian influenza declined with warmer weather and the end of the wild-bird migration in the autumn and winter months. But outbreaks have continued across the UK and elsewhere in Europe for far longer this year. Last year, almost two-thirds of the 11.3bn eggs produced in the UK were free range.

{"id": "239", "title": "Deaths of thousands of wild birds from avian flu is �ew Silent Spring�", "date": "2023-01-04", "fulltext": "Expert warns impact of H5N1 virus across the world is on a scale akin to the devastation wreaked by the use of DDT pesticides in the 1950s and 1960s. The planet is experiencing a new 'Silent Spring' of wildlife destruction because so many wild birds have died from avian flu, according to a leading scientist, who said the past year has seen the most significant and sudden loss of birds in decades. James Pearce-Higgins, director of science at the British Trust for Ornithology, said: 'The last time we experienced such large-scale and rapid losses of wild birds in the UK would be the impacts of DDT on birds of prey in the 1950s and 1960s associated with the Silent Spring narrative, or the widespread declines of farmland birds during the 1970s and 80s as a result of agricultural intensification.' The Silent Spring narrative refers to the seminal 1962 book by Rachel Carson about how pesticides, particularly DDT, were killing birds. DDT caused egg shells to become so thin that adults crushed them during incubation, leading to nest failure and the deaths of thousands of birds. The World Organisation for Animal Health estimates that more than 50,000 wild birds have died of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 since October 2021, mainly in Europe and America. But experts say this is likely to be a huge underestimate. In the UK alone, numbers could be in the hundreds of thousands, although conservationists say the true impact is still unknown, and most are unwilling to speculate. In the UK, the effects of avian flu started in the northernmost islands of Scotland in spring, spreading south down the east coast of England reaching as far south as Sussex, with colonies of nesting seabirds the worst hit. Already there are more than a dozen outbreaks dotted across the country among wintering waterbirds. This suggests it is already widespread and will be found in breeding seabird colonies again next year, said Pearce-Higgins. There were more than 3,500 virus detections in wild birds across Europe in the 2021-2022 season, with reports from 37 countries that it was being seen in 63 wild bird species, according to an avian influenza overview published by the European Food Safety Authority. For wild birds, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the UK had the most reported cases, with most coming from coastal areas because seabirds were the worst affected. The first US case in this current outbreak was in an American wigeon duck in South Carolina on 14 January 2022. Since then, there have been 3,700 positive tests in 47 states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet testing should not be taken as an indicator of impact, because only a fraction of birds that die will be collected and sent for laboratory testing, researchers say. 'Reported numbers are likely a vast underestimate,' said Michelle Wille from the University of Sydney. 'For example, of the approximate 8,000 sandwich terns that died in the Netherlands, only a handful are included in the official numbers—in this case a more than 200x difference between reported numbers and observed. The lack of appreciation for the scale of wild bird mortality is concerning as there may be species/population level ramifications.' Globally, most reports are coming from Europe, and then America, according to UN mapping data, but the disease has also spread through Africa and Asia. In November this year, bird flu was found in South America, with concerns that it will reach the Galápagos. Scientists suspect that a migratory Franklin's gull brought the subtype H5N1 from the US. More than 13,000 seabirds died, including more than 5,500 pelicans in Peru. It has since spread to five countries in South America, according to the Pan American Health Organization. 'The high-pathogenicity avian influenza outbreak recently reported for coastal Peru is a severe situation. Evidence has shown the possibility of the virus spreading among other groups of birds,' said Luis German Naranjo, the conservation director at WWF Colombia. The UK has about 60% of the world population of great skua and northern gannets. Both have seen 'unprecedented levels of mortality' said Pearce-Higgins, with population impacts likely to last decades as they are long-lived, slow reproducing species. Experts say the picture will become clearer in the coming years, as we see how many migratory seabirds come back to breed, giving a better idea of how many died.

{"id": "240", "title": "The equivalent to our Covid pandemic� bird flu hasn�t gone away and is still spreading", "date": "2023-01-04", "fulltext": "Wild bird populations have been decimated across the UK and scientists fear there is more to come in 2023. It is more than a year since avian flu began to devastate wild birds in large numbers, and conservationists are fearful of what 2023 will hold. The highly infectious variant of H5N1 has caused Europe’s worst bird flu season and has spread across the globe with little sign of slowing. In the UK, there were reports of some great skua dying from the H5N1 variant in the summer of 2021 but the mass die-offs started in the autumn and winter. More than a third of Svalbard barnacle geese in the Solway Firth, on the border of England and Scotland, 6,500 out of 43,000 died last winter. A year later, there has been no letup, with Greenland barnacle geese on the Scottish island of Islay (the other main site where these geese overwinter) dropping dead in increasingly large numbers. 'I’m sitting with a sense of dread that it definitely will get worse as I see more reports coming in from reserves across the UK,' says Claire Smith from RSPB Scotland. 'I’m haunted by the numbers of dead great skua that I saw on Shetland in the summer and I’m avoiding going birdwatching on the coast.' From April to mid-August 2022 avian flu ravaged colonies of seabirds in the UK, peaking in June at the height of the breeding season. These birds had previously been affected by H5N1 at very low levels. Seabirds generally migrate over summer, so numbers dropped again, but already there are outbreaks across the country among wintering waterbirds (which typically gather in large flocks, making them more vulnerable at this time of year). There have been cases in the south-west, the Midlands, East Anglia, Wales and the Isle of Man, each with numbers in the tens or low hundreds of dead water birds, with greylag geese, pink-footed geese, Canada geese and mute swans among the most affected. Red-listed herring gulls across the north-east are already being impacted, with dead puffins washing up in Norfolk, which is unusual at this time of year when there is no stormy weather. They are yet to be tested, but the presumed cause of death is bird flu. Cases in other groups of birds have been reported all over the country, and the RSPB called for a temporary ban on the release of game birds this year, to lessen the risk of spreading avian flu, but this was not taken up by government. Positive tests in peregrine falcons, buzzards, wild tawny owls and rooks have been recorded in recent months. Although there are not the same big die-offs, there are a lot of cases over a wide area, with more in urban and semi-urban areas. Positive tests are not an indication of the actual number of birds affected because few carcasses are found, let alone tested. 'We can expect HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] to persist into the next breeding season and beyond, with unpredictable consequences,' a report from the International Seabird Group conference warned in November. This will be the equivalent to our Covid pandemic, because we’re dealing with major outbreaks, major fatalities – Prof Kin-Chow Chang, University of Nottingham. It is a case of waiting to see what happens next, says Prof Ian Brown, head of virology at the government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). Commercial hens can be shut up, but you cannot control the movement of wild birds. 'That horse has bolted,' he says. 'It is unusual that this particular event is dominated by one particular strain over such a big geographical area. I can’t remember any time since 1996 [when H5N1 started], where a single strain has caused so much global spread.' Bird flu is highly infectious, with scientists saying one bird can infect as many as 100, with the virus present in faeces, mucus, blood and saliva. 'You need a very tiny quantity – a teaspoon of faeces will probably be enough to kill an entire house of chickens or turkeys,' says Brown. The most common transmission between wild birds and poultry is probably indirectly, through birds in the nearby environment. Unpublished studies have shown that at 4C, the virus can stay in the environment for six weeks, according to Brown. It could be someone walking across a field and treading in infected bird droppings, and then failing to disinfect their boots before going into the poultry house. Or it could be transferred on bedding, or possibly via rodents. Brown says that more than 99% of cases in poultry in the UK have come from wild birds. Apha knows this by working out the genome of a virus and comparing what it looks like in wild birds with its appearance in poultry. The researchers also look at the affected farm and possible routes of infection into poultry houses. Prof Kin-Chow Chang, from the veterinary school at the University of Nottingham, agrees commercial populations are getting it either directly or indirectly from wild birds. 'The virus is very infectious, it doesn’t need a lot to start an infection,' he says. Little is known about the number of birds with antibodies. Because vaccinations for wild birds are not considered a feasible option, they will need to get some sort of herd immunity. Brown says: 'There is a very small proportion of birds that can get infected, can recover from infection and then have immunity which means they won’t get that virus again. And over time that would build, but we don’t understand that at all. We need to do further work. That research is being commissioned and happening across the world.' The present variant of H5N1 originated in south-east Asia, where it was found in commercial geese. For the past four years, these strains of avian flu have been highly pathogenic, meaning they cause severe disease and death. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh are trying to work out why the current strain is causing longer and larger outbreaks than those that came before, which will also help understand how the disease will evolve and spread in the future. It could be down to changes in the surface proteins on the virus, meaning they can more easily attach to wild birds, or it may be more stable in the environment, so the virus could live in a pond over summer rather than breaking down in warm temperatures and sunlight as have previous bird flu viruses. It may become less damaging when sufficient numbers of birds have been infected, or the virus could evolve again, making it easier to spill into other species including mammals and humans. In August 2022, Defra said that mitigation strategies 'are not very effective in reducing transmission within seabird colonies.' However, there are other ways to reduce the pressures seabirds are under, as they have already been hit by a range of threats including habitat loss, overfishing and the climate crisis. Since 1986, the UK’s population of breeding seabirds has fallen by almost a quarter. Reducing these other pressures would make them more resilient to bird flu, says Smith. The RSPB says it is generally not picking up dead birds on its reserves because it risks the health of the people doing it, and causes disturbance among living birds which could spread the disease further. Visitors are asked to keep dogs on leads and to clean their shoes thoroughly before and after visiting. However, other wildlife groups, such as those working for the National Trust, have decided to collect carcasses because it could result in the disease spreading further if they are scavenged by others. Conservationists are calling for better monitoring and surveillance of the disease in wild birds, as well as clearer arrangements for carcass collection. Chang says: 'This will be the equivalent to our Covid pandemic, because we’re dealing with major outbreaks, major fatalities, and possibly major disruption to the domestic poultry production market as well.' The public should not touch dead or dying birds, and should report suspected bird flu cases to Defra on 03459 33 55 77.

These Guardian readers from the UK were among those who got in touch to tell us about what they have witnessed: Retiree Allan Davidson said that by midsummer in 2022 miles of beautiful beaches near his home in Golspie, Sutherland, in the Scottish Highlands, were littered with dead seabirds, mainly guillemots and gannets. 'Most died out at sea and had been swept in to shore. Some would simply stand, comatose, oblivious to my presence. I would find them lifeless the next morning in the same spot I left them,' he says. 'What struck me was that the vast majority of the dead birds I encountered had been fine, healthy creatures in excellent condition. They were not emaciated or undernourished. No one was accepting responsibility for what was becoming a ghastly unnatural event of our making. Armed with a spade, several pairs of rubber gloves and a pair of wellies, I started at one end of the beach and spent four beautiful mid-summer evenings burying 98 guillemots, gannets, little gulls, herring gulls and one great skua.' He says he contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) and notified them of what he'd done. For David Mynne, an actor from Penzance, it is the lack of birds he finds strange. 'I live on the coast and have spent my life surrounded by squawking gulls. They fill the air with their noise, from sunrise to sunset, but now there is nothing. Not a sign of a gull anywhere. After a lifetime of the ceaseless, noisy chatter this feels distinctly weird.' Jo Clear works for the NHS and lives near Boldon pond in South Tyneside, where a pair of nesting swans raise cygnets each year. She says: 'The local kids, and anyone who walks past, enjoy watching them grow from fluffy babies to fully fledged birds. They waddle up and down a busy road, and the council even has a sign up saying Caution Swans nesting to make sure drivers slow down.' Last December, however, she drove past and noticed two people in hi-vis jackets by the pond. 'They were taking the dead swans away the seven cygnets and their mother. Only the male was left. They'd all had avian flu. All winter the male swam alone and serene up and down the pond. The whole village felt sorry for him. This spring, though, he found a new mate. They've had three cygnets this year. Fingers crossed they avoid avian flu. It has brought a bit of hope to everyone, and so the new female is called Hope.' Jenny Aitchison, a retiree from Aberdeen, says she has seen 'probably thousands' of birds affected by avian flu. 'Over the summer and autumn, I saw children chasing sick birds, dogs rolling on carcasses and people swimming only feet away from floating dead birds. When I spoke to people about avian flu, none had heard of it. Sepa and the local council advised reporting of large numbers. I did this after one beach visit where I saw over 100 bodies. I returned a month later, and the same birds were still there in an advanced state of decomposition with terns and gulls scavenging on the bodies.' Sue Wilkinson, a retiree from Topsham, near Exeter, was picking raspberries in her garden when a Canada goose skimmed past her head and landed a foot away, crushing some raspberry canes. 'I screamed and ran inside,' she says. 'My husband managed to manoeuvre the goose on to the lawn, using a rake to encourage it. It walked round in circles for a while, looking dazed, and eventually lay down in a corner of the garden. The next morning it was dead. We contacted the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they said they weren't interested unless there were three dead birds. We also contacted the RSPB, the RSPCA, a swan sanctuary and the local council without success. We were told to put it in the dustbin but didn't want to handle it or leave it there for 10 days before the next collection. In the end, we paid someone to remove it.' Geoff Humble, a member of university admissions staff in Leeds, says he saw dozens of gannets washed up on the German island of Spiekeroog this summer. 'It was awful,' he says. 'On some stretches, a bird lay every few metres in the sand. The lifeguards were burying any they came across, but said they had seen hundreds.' Its neck was contorting and it was unable to fly away from me. I knew immediately that it was dying Heidi Stern Heidi Stern, a project manager from Saddleworth, near Oldham, has struggled with poor mental health for decades and took up photography to improve her wellbeing. She was at one of her favourite nature reserves when she spotted a sick bird. 'While walking between hides I noticed a large greylag goose very close to the path,' she says. 'I approached to take a photo then realised its neck was contorting and it was unable to fly away from me. I knew immediately that this goose was dying of the dreaded disease.' She called the local RSPB warden so it could be removed. 'I stood and waited with tears rolling down my face,' she says. 'Frampton Marsh is a haven, a place of beauty and tranquility where I could escape in times of crisis. Now it's having a devastating crisis of its own, one which essentially we can do nothing about. What a tragic state of affairs we are in, politically, economically and now it feels like even the beautiful birds we are surrounded by are suffering a heartbreaking catastrophe of their own.' Kate Hardy, from Essex, works in healthcare and loves bird-watching. She says she started the year exploring the Highlands of Scotland, visiting black grouse breeding grounds, watching long-tailed ducks and getting dive-bombed by great skua. 'The end of the year makes for a devastating contrast,' she says. 'Those same shores sources of such keen pleasure for me are now laden with the corpses of gannets and other precious seabirds. One of the most devastating sights for me was the colony of sandwich tern off Blakeney Harbour [in Norfolk]. I watched affected birds falling into the sea, with other birds from the colony swirling around them in obvious distress.

{"id": "242", "title": "Pandemic potential: bird flu outbreaks fuelling chance of human spillover", "date": "2023-01-12", "fulltext": "Experts say record waves of avian influenza have been setting off alarms, with fears virus could adapt to spread among people. Multiple waves of avian influenza have left a trail of devastation across the globe, leading to the deaths and culling of more than 300 million chickens, ducks and geese and an unknown number of wild birds between 2005 and 2021. Today, with parts of Europe and North America in the midst of the worst outbreak on record, a global cohort of researchers is keeping cautious watch amid concerns about the impact the disease could have on humans. 'There is concern about it having pandemic potential,' says Wendy Blay Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University. 'Before Covid was on anybody's radar, this was the one that we were all watching very closely.' The virus is currently considered a low risk to humans, she says. 'But anything that has the ability to replicate and evolve rapidly, and anything that has that ability to infect a lot of different hosts is kind of on borrowed time.' Much of the focus of experts is on H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza that has fuelled, in part, the surge in cases around the world. First identified at a goose farm in Guangdong, China in 1996, the virus has turned up in at least 63 species of wild birds and has shown itself capable of infecting mammals such as bobcats, harbour seals and bears. If it has become established in wild birds, it is far more complex to control it and predict where it will go next, says Nichola J Hill, University of Massachusetts. The more the virus spreads, the greater the chances are that it may spill over into humans, says Thijs Kuiken, a professor in the department of viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam. Once the virus infects humans, the concern is that it could further adapt to allow human-to-human transmission. 'The chance of this happening is very small, but the impact if it does happen is very big, because it means that we then have a new influenza pandemic,' he says, pointing to the 1918 flu, believed to have killed as many as 50 million people, as an example of a pandemic that has been linked to an avian influenza and originating in birds. As H5N1 crisscrosses the globe, its impact on humans has set off alarms; between 2003 and October 2022, the virus turned up in 865 humans in 21 countries, resulting in 456 deaths. While the cases, most of them in Africa and Asia, were linked to the handling of infected live poultry rather than human-to-human transmission, the figures suggest the virus has a high case fatality rate in people who become infected, says Kuiken. Public health officials are taking few chances. In the UK, where a duck breeder tested positive for the virus in late 2021 after handling infected poultry, the Health Security Agency has been working to develop an 'off the shelf exercise' to prepare for an outbreak of avian flu among humans, the UKHSA told the Guardian in an email. In the Canadian province of British Columbia, public health officials recently warned doctors to watch out for avian flu infections among patients, after a spike in cases among poultry at local farms. The virus would probably require more than one or two changes to enable human-to-human transmission, says Ian Barr, the deputy director of the WHO's Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne. 'We never really know with these viruses but they've been with us for 18 years in various forms and they haven't yet gained that function of being easily transmissible to man,' says Barr. 'So, hopefully the virus finds that a difficult thing to do, but it's something which we're not entirely knowledgeable about.' He described it as a game of numbers. 'The more viruses that are out there, the more species that they infect, the longer they hang around for, then the more chance there is for something to mutate or go awry or reassort with an unwanted consequence.' Efforts to halt the spread of this strain of virus have been complicated by its prevalence in wild birds, says Rebecca Poulson of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia. 'We know birds move incredibly long distances,' she says. 'And if these birds are infected and are shedding these viruses as they move across the landscape, they can disseminate it quite far and wide in a really short amount of time.' The presence of the virus in wild birds and farmed poultry has allowed it to ping-pong between populations and amplify its spread, says Nichola J Hill, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. 'I think we used to cling to this idea that we can control the virus in poultry, we're set, no problem,' she says. 'And now we're facing a new era because if it has become established in wild birds, that's a far more complex situation in terms of figuring out how to control it and predict where it will go next.' What is clear, however, is the role our food system has played in getting us to this point, she says, citing the high densities of poultry seen in commercial farming and the genetic similarity of most of the animals.

{"id": "243", "title": "Bird Flu Cuts Egg Supply, Furthering a Price Surge", "date": "2023-01-13", "fulltext": "An avian flu outbreak and increasing costs of fuel, feed and packaging have contributed to an egg supply shortage and high prices in some parts of the country. A grocery staple that for decades has been a relatively cheap and reliable item has now become an elusive and even lavishly priced commodity. At a Whole Foods in Manhattan on Wednesday, shelves were empty for the cheapest eggs -- $3.39 for a carton of 12 large brown Grade A eggs. What remained were more expensive options like organic, cage-free eggs for more than $7. Even then, the customers were limited to two egg cartons, according to a sign on the refrigerator door, 'due to a nationwide shortage of eggs.' Other grocery stores, like certain locations of Kroger across the United States and Lidl in Britain, have also limited egg purchases. Prices of eggs across some countries are rising sharply. One factor behind the shortage and the sharp rise in egg prices is an outbreak of avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, a highly contagious virus that is often fatal to chickens. Since the outbreak was detected last February, more than 57 million birds in hundreds of commercial and backyard flocks have been affected by it, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Infected or exposed flocks are culled to prevent the virus from spreading, a measure that has resulted in the depopulation of more than 44 million laying hens in the U.S. since the outbreak, according to the Agriculture Department. The depopulations at commercial facilities have decreased the domestic egg supply by about 7.5 percent on average each month since the outbreak began, the department said. Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman with the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said that after facilities are sanitized and restocked with healthy laying hens, it takes about four to five months for them to 'reach peak productivity' of about 24 eggs per month. The virus has also been detected around the world, including in Canada and countries in Europe and South America, according to United Egg Producers, the trade group that represents most commercial egg farmers in the United States. Emily Metz, president and chief executive of the American Egg Board, said in an interview on Wednesday that while bird flu has played a role, increasing costs of fuel, feed and packaging have also contributed to pricier and scarcer eggs. 'Is avian flu a factor? Yes,' Ms. Metz said. 'Is it the only factor? No, and I would argue it's not even the biggest factor in where these prices are right now.' Combined, the avian flu and other rising costs have created scenes of empty shelves at grocery stores across the country, from Colorado to New York. In some instances, people have resorted to buying their own chickens, local media in Arizona and Massachusetts have reported. While the shortages have not been dire, the jump in prices is noticeable for consumers and businesses. In January 2022, the average price for a dozen of large Grade A eggs in the U.S. was $1.39, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By November, the average price had increased to $3.59. Ben Suh, the owner of Between the Bagel NY in Queens, said that he had tried to hold off on raising prices for as long as he could, but that he would soon increase the cost of menu items with eggs. For instance, the price of a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich will increase to $7 from $6, Mr. Suh said. 'Everyone's been struggling since the pandemic began, so we've been trying to keep our prices down,' Mr. Suh said. A year ago, Mr. Suh said he would typically pay $70 to $80 for 30 dozen eggs. Now, he is paying $150 to $160 for the same order, he said. 'Everything's doubled,' Mr. Suh said, adding that because of inflation, he has also had to pay more for other products, including bacon and coffee. At Brey's Egg Farm in Jeffersonville, N.Y., flocks of chickens have been spared from the avian flu. Daniel Brey, the farm's owner, said that after a destructive nationwide avian flu outbreak in 2014 and 2015 killed more than 50 million birds, he set up a gate around his farm to prevent wild birds from entering and potentially spreading diseases. Mr. Brey said that vehicles entering the farm were sprayed with disinfectant, another precaution to protect the farm, which produces 228,000 eggs daily. 'This stuff is so contagious,' Mr. Brey said of the bird flu. 'You've got to be careful everywhere.' While the avian flu rarely infects humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the contagiousness of the virus requires farmers to quickly euthanize infected and exposed flocks. 'This virus is fatal,' Ms. Metz said. 'Once it comes into contact with your flock, it will kill your birds.' Because there have been fewer reported cases of avian flu at commercial egg-laying facilities in recent weeks, Mr. Brey said that he believed the egg shortage would ease soon, as well as the high prices. But Mr. Brey said he was concerned that cases could rebound in the spring and spread to other birds, such as geese, ducks, hawks and eagles. So far this year, recorded cases of the avian flu dropped significantly, with only one commercial flock and 10 backyard flocks affected, according to the Agriculture Department, compared with more than 5.07 million birds in December and more than 3.75 million birds in November. A statement last week from United Egg Producers echoed that assessment, saying that there was an expected lull in the virus over the next two months, but the group warned of 'detections rapidly increasing as spring and the migration season renews.' Ms. Cole said that as farms restocked, supply would likely improve, but she cautioned that the virus was still lingering within the United States. 'We know there will continue to be a threat to domestic birds as long as the HPAI virus is circulating in wild birds, so all bird owners should continue to be vigilant,' Ms. Cole said, referring to the avian virus. For now, stores including some Kroger, Whole Foods and Lidl locations are limiting egg purchases for customers. A Kroger spokeswoman said that the bird flu had caused 'tens of millions of birds to be removed from the U.S. supply chain and egg production over the last nine months,' but that Kroger's 'egg supply remains adequate.' A Lidl spokesman said that 'in periods of high demand relative to product supply, as retailers nationally see today with eggs, our stores may place temporary quantity limits on high-demand products.' Ms. Metz said that as the avian flu lingers, farmers will have to continue to manage outbreaks of the virus, measures they are better prepared to take after the experience of the 2014-2015 outbreak. 'We're recovering so much more quickly than we did in 2015,' Ms. Metz said. 'Managing the virus is just going to be that much better, and it's going to be much less of a factor as we go forward in pricing.' Some stores, lacking egg supply, have limited the number of cartons customers can buy.

Unlike prior strains of the disease in North America, this strain is causing widespread mortality in some species of wild birds, particularly in snow geese, raptors, and vultures, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Bill Vogrin said in a statement to CNN on Monday. The agency began receiving reports of sick and dead snow geese in northeastern Colorado in late 2022, the statement said. It documented over 1,000 deaths on several waterways in Morgan and Logan counties. Then officials heard of large-scale mortalities in the southeastern portion of the state. There was a die-off of approximately 600 snow geese at John Martin Reservoir, the statement said, noting lower die-offs at surrounding reservoirs. After highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed in a certain species and county, the wildlife department will not test additional birds of that species within that county until the next season -- but additional deaths are still counted, the statement said.

{"id": "245", "title": "Sticker shock at the egg aisle? Blame bird flu.", "date": "2023-01-17", "fulltext": "It's hard to swallow, but the rising cost of your breakfast is a taste you will be forced to acquire. Egg prices are up, along with that of bacon, because of climate-influenced animal disease and a growing world population that demands more protein. One of the world's largest producers of liquid eggs—already cracked and sold mostly in bulk to restaurants and bakeries—is practically in my backyard. Called Rembrandt Foods, the Northwest Iowa plant has been shut down since last spring over bird flu. It's the company's second shutdown in seven years. Five million laying hens were destroyed. More than 200 workers, mostly immigrant, were laid off. There is no word on when the huge henhouse will cluck again. The same flu caused more than 400,000 turkeys to be snuffed out in four counties around Storm Lake, Iowa, where the agri-giant Tyson Foods operates both turkey and pork processing plants employing some 3,000 workers. Maybe you've priced a turkey with mayo on wheat lately. Waterfowl spread the flu. In recent years, geese that used to migrate through the Dakotas and Nebraska shifted east to fly over the densest livestock production area in North America—Northwest Iowa—because of epic drought. As they fly, they poop, shedding virus as they go. A breeze passes over the teeming feces and into hog houses holding 1,000 porkers or turkey barns filled with 20,000 birds. Once the flu is inside, it spreads like... flu. No longer an epidemic, the flu has become endemic. It's not even seasonal anymore. Rembrandt's hens got hit in March while Tyson's turkeys went down in December. Experts exhort producers to practice biosecurity, but Rembrandt was. After a flu wave in 2015 killed production, the Rembrandt plant was sealed up tight. But a virus doesn't need a welcome mat to make itself at home. Meanwhile, China is trying to rebuild its swine herd. The pork-lovingest people on Earth lost half their hogs to African swine flu in recent years; in response, they are erecting high-rise hog hotels of up to 26 stories. And African swine flu is not the worst scenario: Encephalitis can jump from hogs to humans. When African swine flu spread to Haiti, my hometown shuddered: Storm Lake, Hog Capital of the World. You begin to wonder if packing 5 million hens into one huge building, as my neighbors at Rembrandt have done in pursuit of more liquid eggs at lower prices for hungry people, is such a good idea anymore. The Upper Midwest can't handle the manure we're already pumping. Our rivers are rife with nitrate and phosphorus from it. The Gulf of Mexico is suffocating from it. This is the price of modern food production. We never thought we'd see sliced turkey for $9.99 a pound right here in Turkey Town. Something has to change. It's too late to wipe out bird flu: Bears out West are catching it, the Agriculture Department reports. A human in China turned up with a different strain. A healthy way forward might take a little from the past and a lot from the future. Techniques from Grandpa's day unquestionably yield healthier animals. Chickens pecking in the yard survived the 2015 bird flu even as turkeys died by the tens of thousands in a mega-barn a few hundred feet away. A hog bred for the pasture has stronger immunity than his cousin in a Chinese high-rise. But human stomachs rumbling for protein number in the billions. How do we do healthy at massive scale? Tyson, among others, is investing in \"cultured\" meat grown from the cells of swine, cattle and poultry. Folks say the resulting chicken tastes like... chicken. The protein market will stratify: When a customer can afford a premium rib-eye, there will be an (expensive) steer in a healthy meadow to meet the demand. But folks who want a chicken strip, a deli sandwich, a meat-lover's pizza or a burger buried in cheese won't know the difference between today's factory animal and tomorrow's lab-grown meat. Most people scared of cultured meat have never seen how the stuff they're eating now gets made. As production of high-tech protein ramps up, the cost will come down—and demands on natural resources will ebb. (Arnold the pig can drink a gallon and a half of water per day.) And it's customizable. If you prefer fatty bacon, the beaker can accommodate that. Meantime, the price of prime Iowa farmland was up another 17 percent last year, reaching around $16,000 per acre. Brokers expect it to go higher this year. The smart money knows where the golden egg lies. So enjoy that breakfast—and while you can afford it, please leave the waitress a nice tip.

{"id": "246", "title": "Grizzly bears test positive for bird flu in Montana, officials say", "date": "2023-01-18", "fulltext": "Three grizzly bears were euthanized in Montana after they became ill and tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, according to the state's Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks. These were the first documented cases of bird flu in a grizzly in Montana and the first nationwide for this outbreak of HPAI, according to Dr. Jennifer Ramsey, the department's wildlife veterinarian. The juvenile bears were in three separate locations in the western part of the state during the fall, the Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks said in a statement. The bears were observed to be in poor condition and exhibited disorientation and partial blindness, among other neurological issues, the statement said. They were euthanized due to their sickness and poor condition. Avian influenza -- commonly called bird flu -- is a naturally occurring virus that spreads quickly in birds. There were documented cases of HPAI in a skunk and a fox in Montana last year, and the virus has been seen in raccoons, black bears and a coyote in other states and countries, according to the Montana agency. The virus is spread from one bird to another, Dr. Ramsey told CNN via email. These mammals likely got infected from consuming carcasses of HPAI infected birds. Fortunately, unlike avian cases, generally small numbers of mammal cases have been reported in North America, Ramsey said. For now, we are continuing to test any bears that demonstrate neurologic symptoms or for which a cause of death is unknown. While finding three grizzlies with bird flu in a short period of time may raise concerns, Ramsey said it may well be that there have been more cases that haven't been detected. When wildlife mortalities occur in such small numbers or individuals, and in species like skunks, foxes and bears that don't spend a lot of time in situations where they are highly visible to the public, they can be hard to detect, the wildlife veterinarian said. When you get that first detection you tend to start looking harder, and you're more likely to find new cases, she said. When a large number of birds are found dead on a body of water, it gets noticed and reported... when someone sees a dead skunk, they may think nothing of it and not report it. While it's unknown just how prevalent the virus is in wild birds, we know that the virus is active basically across the entire state due to the wide distribution of cases of HPAI mortality in some species of wild birds, Ramsey said. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in November the country was approaching a record number of birds affected compared to previous bird flu outbreaks, with more than 49 million birds in 46 states dying or being killed due to exposure to infected birds. Human infections with bird flu are rare but are possible, usually after close contact with infected birds.

{"id": "247", "title": "Three Montana Grizzly Bears Euthanized Last Fall Tested Positive for Avian Flu", "date": "2023-01-20", "fulltext": "The bears are believed to have contracted the virus from diseased birds, amid what a U.S.D.A. spokesman called the 'largest foreign animal disease outbreak in U.S. history.' Three young grizzly bears in Montana that were euthanized last fall later tested positive for the highly contagious avian influenza, the state's Fish, Wildlife and Parks service announced this week, fueling fears that the virus that has killed millions of poultry in the last year is rapidly spreading to other animal groups. The bears were disoriented, had begun to go blind and were euthanized as a result of their poor condition, the parks service said in a news release on Tuesday. They tested positive for the virus in January, said Dr. Jennifer Ramsey, the veterinarian for Fish, Wildlife and Parks. She said the bears had most likely contracted the virus from consuming diseased birds with high levels of the virus. The outbreak of the current strain of the bird flu known as H5N1 is 'the largest foreign animal disease outbreak in U.S. history,' according to a spokesman for the U.S. Agriculture Department. It has infected nearly 60 million commercial and backyard flocks of birds in 47 states, and its near ubiquity has driven up poultry prices and caused egg shortages in supermarkets across the country, as consumers jostle for cartons topping $7 or more. Most of the infections are found in wild birds, and some of those spread to other animals that prey on them. The Agriculture Department has recorded avian flu infections in 110 mammals since May 2022, including raccoons, foxes and skunks. The grizzly bears' positive tests mark the first time that Montana has recorded bird flu in a mammal species. 'It's disappointing,' Dr. Ramsey said in an interview. 'I think in the spring we had a really high peak of wild bird mortality and we all had a hope that this thing would kind of fade out over the summer, and then we wouldn't have a lot of cases this winter. But that hasn't been the case.' Vaccines against the bird flu exist but are not yet widely available for the H5N1 strain in the United States. Only a handful of cases have been recorded in humans. Dr. Ramsey said she recommended that humans keep their pets away from dead birds and wear gloves when handling any dead wildlife. Wild bird populations tend to migrate across hundreds of miles and are often asymptomatic when infected, making it difficult for wildlife experts to track and contain the virus. Should it continue to spread during the spring and summer when temperatures warm and mammals emerge from hibernation, infectious disease experts say, the virus is likely to become more widespread among other animal groups, including mammals and aquatic animals. Still, the extent of infection in birds is enough cause for concern for the experts tracking its spread. 'We have not had this virus in our part of the world on this scale before,' said Richard Webby, a director in the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

{"id": "248", "title": "Worst Avian Flu in U.S. History Is Hitting Poultry, Wild Birds, Even Bears; Egg-laying flocks in Nebraska, Colorado and elsewhere have been decimated", "date": "2023-01-22", "fulltext": "Nearly a year after it began, the worst avian-influenza outbreak in U.S. history is continuing to decimate poultry flocks across the Midwest and Colorado, frustrating efforts to keep the virus from affecting the nation's egg prices and supply. In South Dakota, the highly contagious bird flu, typically transmitted by the feces, mucus and saliva of wild birds, first hit commercial poultry farms in March 2022 and has continued to affect flocks. Within the last month, egg-laying hens and turkeys at several local farms were infected, leading to the deaths of more than 1.3 million poultry over that period, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Nearly four million poultry have died in the state since the start of the outbreak. Nebraska, where more than 4.8 million poultry died during a 2015 bird-flu outbreak, has surpassed 6.7 million poultry deaths from the current outbreak, according to state and federal data. Colorado has lost more than 90% of its table egg-laying hens, while also seeing its population of wild birds including snow geese, raptors, hawks and eagles sickened, state officials said. \"One of the challenges is that we don't know why it has been able to thrive for so long. We're almost a full year into this outbreak and it is ongoing,\" said Maggie Baldwin, Colorado's state veterinarian. Some 6.25 million poultry in Colorado have died so far. People working on the problem say there is no easy way to stop the spread of bird flu. Instead, the virus must be allowed to run its course. \"There is no historical context for this. It's like when Covid hit for humans,\" said Mike Tincher, rehabilitation coordinator for Colorado's Rocky Mountain Raptor Program. To keep bird flu from spreading, entire poultry flocks must be destroyed after an infection is confirmed. The outbreak has caused the deaths of nearly 58 million poultry in 47 states, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. While it rarely affects humans, the disease is mostly fatal for domestic birds. It can also infect other animals. On Tuesday, Montana wildlife officials said three young grizzly bears had contracted bird flu during the fall and were euthanized, the first known cases of grizzlies getting the disease. The bears likely contracted the virus from eating infected birds, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks veterinarian Jennifer Ramsey. One facility in Colorado's Weld County that had restocked with healthy hens after initially having to euthanize its flock because of the virus was struck again by an outbreak last month, said Bill Scebbi, executive director of the Colorado Egg Producers, which represents five family farms. The facility had to euthanize its new flock, Mr. Scebbi said. He said the flu has been destructive to Colorado's egg industry, with farmers having to purchase eggs from out of state to meet customer demand. Egg farmers aren't insured against the virus, Mr. Scebbi said, and estimated losses are in the millions. \"It's been devastating to their businesses, to their farms and personally devastating to their livelihoods,\" he said. Still, according to Emily Metz, president and chief executive of the American Egg Board, which represents egg producers, many farms around the country are recovering from the outbreak. There are currently about 6% fewer hens laying eggs than normal nationwide, she said. According to the group, egg producers have developed better biosecurity measures since the 2015 outbreak, such as securing areas to keep wild birds away and keeping equipment clean, which can help keep the virus from spreading from farm to farm. Wholesale prices of Midwest large eggs hit a record $5.46 a dozen in December, according to the research firm Urner Barry. Prices have fallen back to $3.77 a dozen this month after the seasonal demand of the holiday baking season. In addition to the millions of poultry at farms that have been killed, many wild birds have been infected as well, officials said. Jim Gammonley, who supervises the avian research program for the Colorado Parks and Wildlife division, said the state has experienced die-offs of snow geese in the thousands due to the virus. The die-offs have typically occurred in and around reservoirs where the snow geese like to roost at night, he said. In one case, field staff were called to a reservoir just before Thanksgiving where they found about 1,000 dead geese, which they retrieved. The next day, the employees returned to check on the reservoir and found another 1,000 dead geese, Mr. Gammonley said. Mr. Tincher said his group had located 37 raptors that had tested positive for the virus and referred another 19 to state officials for testing. Such animals typically get the virus by feeding off diseased geese and ducks. \"We've never seen this before. And it's just not slowing down,\" he said.

In South Dakota, the highly contagious bird flu, typically transmitted by the feces, mucus and saliva of wild birds, first hit commercial poultry farms in March 2022 and has continued to affect flocks. Within the past month, egg-laying hens and turkeys at several local farms were infected, leading to the deaths of more than 1.3 million poultry over that period, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data. Nearly four million poultry have died in the state since the start of the outbreak. Nebraska, where more than 4.8 million poultry died during a 2015 bird-flu outbreak, has surpassed 6.7 million poultry deaths from the current outbreak. Colorado has lost more than 90% of its table egg-laying hens, while also seeing its population of wild birds including snow geese, raptors, hawks and eagles sickened, state officials said. \"One of the challenges is that we don't know why it has been able to thrive for so long. We're almost a full year into this outbreak and it is ongoing,\" said Maggie Baldwin, Colorado's state veterinarian. Some 6.25 million poultry in Colorado have died so far. People working on the problem say there is no easy way to stop the spread of bird flu. Instead, the virus must be allowed to run its course. \"There is no historical context for this. It's like when Covid hit for humans,\" said Mike Tincher, rehabilitation coordinator for Colorado's Rocky Mountain Raptor Program. To keep bird flu from spreading, entire poultry flocks must be destroyed after an infection is confirmed. The outbreak has caused the deaths of nearly 58 million poultry in 47 states, according to USDA data. While it rarely affects humans, the disease is mostly fatal for domestic birds. It can also infect other animals. On Tuesday, Montana wildlife officials said three young grizzly bears had contracted bird flu during the fall and were euthanized, the first known cases of grizzlies getting the disease. The bears likely contracted the virus from eating infected birds, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks veterinarian Jennifer Ramsey. One facility in Colorado's Weld County that had restocked with healthy hens after initially having to euthanize its flock because of the virus was struck again by an outbreak in December, said Bill Scebbi, executive director of the Colorado Egg Producers, which represents five family farms. The facility had to euthanize its new flock, Mr. Scebbi said. Egg farmers aren't insured against the virus, Mr. Scebbi said, and estimated losses are in the millions. \"It's been devastating to their businesses, to their farms and personally devastating to their livelihoods,\" he said. Still, according to Emily Metz, president and chief executive of the American Egg Board, which represents egg producers, many farms around the country are recovering from the outbreak.

{"id": "250", "title": "Bird flu outbreak in mink sparks concern about spread in people", "date": "2023-01-24", "fulltext": "A variant of H5N1 influenza that can spread between mammals could pose an increased risk to people and wild animals. An outbreak of avian influenza on a mink farm in Spain provides the strongest evidence so far that the H5N1 strain of flu can spread from one infected mammal to another. The outbreak of H5N1 flu, reported in Eurosurveillance on 19 January1, occurred on an American mink (Neovison vison) farm in Carral in October 2022. Genetic sequencing showed that the animals were infected with a new variant of H5N1, which includes genetic material from a strain found in gulls, as well as a genetic change known to increase the ability of some animal-flu viruses to reproduce in mammals. The new variant puts bird flu in 'uncharted territory' says Wendy Puryear, a virologist at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Researchers have warned that, unless careful precautions are taken, the disease might eventually spread among people. Jumping species Over the past year, H5N1 has shown an increasing ability to jump from birds to mammals. In the United States, infections have been found in about a dozen species, including raccoons, foxes, seals and grizzly bears. Until this particular outbreak, all mammalian infections could be attributed to direct contact with virus-contaminated material, says Hualan Chen, a virologist at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute in China. For example, animals that ingest wild-bird droppings, or that prey on infected animals, can develop the disease. But its spread between mammals 'implies that this H5N1 virus may pose a higher risk to public health' Chen says. During the first week of October 2022, workers on the affected mink farm noticed that the mink's mortality rate had increased from a baseline of 0.25% per week to 0.77%, prompting tests on the affected animals for the H5N1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The animals tested positive for H5N1. In the following weeks, more animals fell sick, and the disease seemed to spread from 'hotspots' of two to four pens, in which all animals became infected and died. Workers were forced to cull all 51,986 mink on the farm. Eleven farm workers came into contact with the infected mink, but all tested negative for H5N1. 'This species could serve as a potential mixing vessel for the interspecies transmission among birds, mammals and human,' the report's authors write. 'It is necessary to strengthen the culture of biosafety and biosecurity in this farming system and promote the implementation of ad hoc surveillance programs for influenza A viruses and other zoonotic pathogens.' Preventing spread Measures taken to prevent the new strain from spreading beyond the farm seem to have been 'rigorous, comprehensive and successful' says infectious-disease specialist William Schaffner at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. COVID mink analysis shows mutations are not dangerous yet But Puryear thinks that because the variant contains genetic material from gull flu, it's likely that at least some of its genetic changes arose in gulls before entering the mink farm. This means that a strain containing those mutations is probably still circulating in the bird population. But for human populations, the outlook is still good: if the new strain did start to infect people, health authorities could probably produce a vaccine quickly, and the antiviral drug Tamiflu (oseltamivir) can reduce the severity of the disease. The potential risk to wild animals is greater. Bird flu has consistently caused high levels of sickness and death among wild birds and mammals over the past year, and how the new variant will affect that trend remains to be seen. 'We just simply don't know,' says Puryear. References 1. Agüero M. et al.

{"id": "251", "title": "Public health experts ramp up avian flu surveillance in UK", "date": "2023-02-02", "fulltext": "Risk to humans, though low, is of concern after at least 200 cases of infection in mammals detected worldwide Avian flu surveillance is being ramped up in the UK after the detection of at least 200 cases of infection in mammals. Public health experts say the risk of a jump to humans is still very low, but that this risk would be monitored through increased genomic surveillance and targeted testing of people who had been exposed to the virus. Concern was also sparked by a recent outbreak of avian flu at a mink farm in Spain and a mass mortality of seals in the Caspian sea that is possibly linked to the infection. 'The virus is absolutely on the march,' Prof Ian Brown, the director of scientific services at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha), told the BBC. He added that experts were 'acutely aware of the risks' of avian flu becoming a pandemic like Covid. 'This global spread is a concern,' he said. 'We do need globally to look at new strategies, those international partnerships, to get on top of this disease.' Over the last two years, the UK has faced its largest outbreak of avian influenza, with more than 300 cases confirmed since October 2021 and with poultry farms all currently required to house birds indoors. Figures reported by the BBC show the virus has led to the deaths of about 208 million birds around the world and at least 200 recorded cases in mammals. In the UK, Apha has tested 66 mammals, including seals, and found nine otters and foxes were positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1. Such cases have been found in Durham, Cheshire and Cornwall in England; Powys in Wales; Shetland, the Inner Hebrides and Fife, Scotland. It is believed the animals had fed on dead or sick wild birds infected with the virus. 'The species affected — foxes and otters — are known to scavenge,' said Dr Alastair Ward, of the University of Leeds. 'In all likelihood, the affected individuals will have scavenged infected wild bird carcasses, which may have had very high viral loads. Such high exposure is likely to have overwhelmed the mammals' immune system, resulting in infection.' There is currently no reason to suspect that the jump is due to a change in the virus' genetic makeup or that the risk to humans is greater from infected foxes or otters than from birds. However, scientists believe close monitoring is required to detect any mutations that could make a leap between species more likely. And reports of the apparent spread of the virus between mammals on a mink farm and the possibility of an outbreak in the wild seal population have heightened concern. Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: 'While these constant incursions of the virus into mammalian species does provide an opportunity for the virus to adapt to mammalian transmission, the natural barriers to this occurring are quite high and there is no indication of spread within these species. The risk to people right now therefore appears no more than it is for direct spread from infected birds.' In a recent report, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warned that the 'rapid and consistent acquisition of the mutation in mammals may imply this virus has a propensity to cause zoonotic infections' meaning it could jump to humans. The agency also raised concerns about limited wild bird and mammal surveillance and genomic data collection in England, and warned that there was not enough testing of people who had been contact with infected birds.

What does that mean for humans?", "date": "2023-02-03", "fulltext": "One of the world's largest outbreaks of bird flu, which led to the slaughter of millions of chickens to limit its spread, appears to be spilling over into mammals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the avian influenza A virus has been detected in mammals such as skunks, bears, a raccoon and a red fox. Though most cases were detected in Oregon, positive tests in mammals were confirmed in the following states, according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services: * Alaska * Colorado * Idaho * Illinois * Montana * Nebraska * New York * Washington Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, the Animal and Plant Health Agency found positive cases in otters and foxes. The agency also said a cat tested positive in France, and the highly contagious pathogen caused a large outbreak in a Spanish mink farm. AVIAN FLU: Here's why egg prices are soaring across the US How is the bird flu being transmitted? Most of these infections are probably independent cases in which a mammal eats an infected bird, said Jürgen Richt, professor and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at Kansas State University. It may be happening more often during this outbreak as viral transmission increases among wild birds, such as ducks, geese and swans. The outbreak at the Spanish mink farm could be a special case in which the virus transmitted from mammal to mammal, Richt said. What does this mean for humans? Though more research is needed, it doesn't bode well for humans. \"If this virus has mammalian adaption and can transmit between mammals, humans are immunologically naive and humans are mammals,\" Richt said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the bird flu situation remains primarily an animal health issue. Only four human infections have ever been reported in the U.S., the CDC said. Bird flu is not a foodborne illness, so poultry and eggs found in grocery stores are safe to eat, Gregory Martin, a poultry educator at Penn State Extension, told USA TODAY last month.

{"id": "254", "title": "Eggs prices drop, but the threat from avian flu isn't over yet", "date": "2023-02-05", "fulltext": "Maybe you've seen the funny internet memes about high egg prices? Like the one where a guy gets on his knees to propose, but instead of a ring, he brings out a dozen precious eggs! Well, egg prices have finally begun to decline. \"We're seeing wholesale prices start to come down,\" says David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University. The wholesale price of a dozen eggs in the midwest market dropped by 58 cents to $3.29 a dozen at the end of January, according to USDA data. There is a lag between a drop in wholesale prices and what we pay at the grocery store, Ortega says, but we can expect some relief soon. I've already seen prices fall at my local supermarket. However, the days of $1.50 a dozen may not return anytime soon. That's partly because inflation has driven up the cost of feed, transportation and labor. But the biggest factor impacting egg prices is the outbreak of bird flu — highly pathogenic avian influenza (HAPI) — which can spread quickly from flock to flock and is lethal in chickens. The CDC estimates more than 58 million birds have died or been culled because of the current outbreak. The virus has caused an acute \"shock\" to the egg supply, Ortega says. And \"there's a lot of uncertainty about how much longer this outbreak will continue.\" Amid such unpredictability, Ortega says prices are sticky. \"They tend to rise quickly, but take much longer to come down.\" Avian flu isn't new, but scientists say this current outbreak is more widespread and more lethal than the last outbreak in 2015. It's been detected in wild birds in all 50 states. Typically, wild birds don't get sick from the virus, but the strain circulating now appears more virulent. \"We're seeing symptoms and we're seeing mortality in some of the wild birds,\" says poultry scientist Phillip Clauer of Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences. \"This time around, it's more deadly,\" Clauer says. The latest CDC data shows the avian flu has been detected in a range of species, including black vultures and geese. There's also a few recent reports of infection in great-horned owls, red-tailed hawks and bald eagles. Since the avian flu began circulating last year, there have been outbreaks at poultry operations in 47 states. Outbreaks typically begin when wild birds, such as geese, infect chickens, turkeys or other waterfowl in commercial flocks or backyard flocks. Once an infection is found in any flock, the USDA euthanizes the whole flock. \"This highly pathogenic disease is very deadly,\" says Clauer. \"So the whole idea is to get on top of it and help the birds die in a humane manner and not allow the disease to continue to spread,\" he explains. In recent years farmers have stepped up biosecurity measures to protect their flocks. \"You're trying to build barriers,\" explains Clauer. For example, since the virus can spread through bird poop or feathers, workers take precautions to keep their hands, clothes and shoes clean. Tools and equipment should be disinfected, too. Farmers try to discourage waterfowl from landing in fields near their poultry houses. \"You're setting a parameter around your poultry to protect them,\" Clauer says. The virus poses a \"low risk\" to people, according to the CDC. The agency says avian flu viruses \"usually do not infect people,\" though last spring, the CDC reported the infection of one person in Colorado who had been in contact with infected poultry. The person reported fatigue and was treated with an antiviral medication. So, when will the outbreak end? \"We don't know,\" says Dr. Yuko Sato, a veterinarian at Iowa State University. \"We hope we're somewhere in the middle or hoping towards the end,\" she says. Sato says killing off infected flocks takes an emotional toll on farmers. \"Nobody likes to be, you know, depopulating, euthanizing birds,\" she says. Then, egg producers must invest in rebuilding their flocks beginning with chicks. \"It takes about somewhere between 16 to 18 weeks for birds to mature to that point to start laying eggs,\" Sato explains. So, there's a lag time to rebuild supplies of eggs. \"Our stock is still down about 5%, right now,\" explains Emily Metz, president of the American Egg Board. But she says farmers are focused on a quick recovery and they continue to invest in prevention strategies to fend off avian flu. \"I have farmers that have put in laser light systems to prevent migratory birds from landing on their barns,\" she explains. \"I have farms that are bussing in their workers to minimize truck traffic,\" and lower the risk of contamination. The hope is that these efforts make the operations more resilient. \"Egg prices are trending downward for sure,\" Metz says. \"I think there's relief in sight.\"", "media_outlet": "NPR", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The virus has caused an acute 'shock' to the egg supply, Ortega says.

A few months ago, I was relatively optimistic about its likely impact this year but outbreaks have continued throughout winter and the outlook for 2023 now looks much grimmer. The current bird flu epidemic is caused by the H5N1 strain of virus, which originated in intensive poultry farms in Asia and has since spread round the globe, with infected migrating birds playing a pivotal role in its spread. In Britain, the disease has had a growing impact on wild birds over the past two years with 65 species being infected. About 16,000 barnacle geese died on the Solway Firth last winter, for example, while more than a quarter of the UK's only roseate tern colony, off the Northumberland coast, died in the summer. On the island of Foula, in Shetland, 1,500 great skuas perished, a number that represents 4% of the world population of these rare large birds. Similarly, thousands of birds have been reported dead at the Bass Rock, the world's largest colony of northern gannets. Britain is home to 55% of the global northern gannet population. Bird flu has also begun to kill hen harriers and white-tailed eagles. Both species are of conservation concern, added Smith. We are seeing kestrels and owls becoming infected probably because they are catching mice and voles that have picked up the virus from poultry farms. These rodents are not necessarily affected by the virus but they are carrying it. The virus has also infected otters and foxes, it was reported last week, though Smith stressed that all but one of these cases had actually occurred in 2021 or 2022. The main problem we face is that we do not know exactly how prevalent this strain of bird flu has become, said Smith. We need to do a great deal of proactive testing to find how much the virus has spread among our wild birds and the government is not doing that. The spread of avian flu puts further pressure on Britain's wild birds, particularly seabirds. Many species breed only once every four or five years but are already suffering from the effects of the climate crisis, commercial development of coastal areas and large-scale fishing of sand eels, an important source of food. It's an increasingly worrying situation, said Smith. At present, it is thought H5N1 only rarely infects people and few cases have been recorded of it being passed from one human to another.

{"id": "256", "title": "Eggs Are Getting Less Expensive�or Stores, Not Shoppers; Supplies likely to remain constrained as long as bird-flu outbreak persists", "date": "2023-02-08", "fulltext": "Eggs are getting cheaper for retailers. For consumers, they are still expensive. Wholesale prices of Midwest large eggs have declined to $2.81 a dozen, according to research firm Urner Barry, down nearly 50% from a record high of more than $5 a dozen in December, but higher than $1.30 a dozen in January 2022. Retail prices for a dozen regular eggs have stayed in the $4 range, NielsenIQ data show, and sold for $4.40 for the week ended Jan. 21. An avian-influenza outbreak has wiped out tens of millions of egg-laying hens, pushing up egg prices in recent months. The prices of eggs rose more than any other grocery item in 2022, and some supermarkets have said they lost money on eggs for weeks last year to keep prices competitive and maintain store traffic. Customers are so sensitive to the price of eggs right now, said Scott Karns, chief executive of Karns Foods in Pennsylvania. The grocer is selling large eggs for $3.39 a dozen this week after paying a wholesale price of $2.75 for them, Mr. Karns said. There is often a lag between wholesale prices—what suppliers charge—and the retail prices that consumers pay as supermarkets try to sell through the inventory they have on hand, he added. In New York, Morton Williams Supermarkets hasn't made major changes to egg prices but expects to lower them next week, said Steve Schwartz, director of sales and marketing at the grocery chain. The company has avoided adjusting prices prematurely and wanted to make sure decreases were here to stay, he said. Demand typically falls after the holiday season, during which people bake more and eat warmer breakfasts. The decline has been steep this year as high prices prompted some shoppers to buy fewer eggs. U.S. retailers sold about 10% fewer eggs for the week ended Jan. 21 compared with the same period a year ago, according to data from NielsenIQ. Retail prices will take a while to come down as food sellers will be reluctant to bring prices down, only to increase them again if another surge in bird-flu cases occurs, said Brian Earnest, a lead animal-protein economist at agricultural lender CoBank. The deadliest outbreak of avian-influenza on record has devastated poultry flocks across the U.S. since February of last year, killing about 58 million birds, including more than 43 million egg-laying chickens. The outbreak, along with higher feed, fuel and packaging costs, has helped raise egg prices since the start of last year, industry analysts said. Egg supplies are expected to remain constrained through the first three months of 2023, according to analysts from agriculture lender Rabobank. Egg producers are rebuilding their flocks faster than during previous outbreaks, according to the American Egg Board, which represents egg producers. Entire flocks of birds are killed after the disease has been detected to prevent the spread. Wendong Zhang, an agricultural economist and assistant professor at Cornell University, said the faster rebuilding of flocks will help, but prices are likely to remain higher than their historical averages as long as the bird-flu outbreak persists. We could see some reduction in prices in the immediate future, he said. If the flu comes back, we'll have some spikes again. Bird-flu cases in commercial flocks were tempered in January, with fewer than 500,000 total bird deaths compared with more than 5 million in December, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. However, USDA officials have said the virus will likely surge back during the spring migration season, when wild birds move across the country. Rosemary Sifford, the USDA's chief veterinary officer said: We expect that they will continue to be carrying it this spring.

{"id": "257", "title": "What a Bird Flu Outbreak Among Mink Could Mean for Humans", "date": "2023-02-08", "fulltext": "A new variant of avian influenza appears capable of spreading among mammals, highlighting the need for more proactive surveillance, experts said. Early last October, the mink on a fur farm in Spain suddenly began to fall ill. They stopped eating and began salivating excessively. They became clumsy, started to experience tremors and developed bloody snouts. At first, experts suspected that the coronavirus might be to blame. It was a reasonable assumption; since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the virus has repeatedly found its way onto mink farms, sparking large animal outbreaks, triggering mass mink culls and prompting temporary moratoriums on mink farming. But it was not the coronavirus that had infiltrated the Spanish mink farm, scientists soon discovered. It was H5N1, a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza. Over the last few years, a new variant of H5N1 has spread widely through wild and domestic bird populations around the world. It has taken an unusually heavy toll on wild birds and repeatedly spilled over into mammals, such as foxes, raccoons and bears, that might feed on infected birds. But the mink farm outbreak was a new and troubling development, scientists said. In Spain, the virus appeared to spread from mink to mink. It also contained an unusual mutation that might be a sign of adaptation to mammals, scientists reported in a recent paper in the journal Eurosurveillance. The outbreak confirmed a fear that I had—that the virus could spread efficiently among mammals, said Dr. Thijs Kuiken, a veterinary pathologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands. There is no evidence that the mink, which were all culled, transmitted the virus to humans, and experts stressed that the outbreak was not a cause for panic. But it is a reminder of some of the risks posed by mink farms—places in which large numbers of susceptible animals are housed in facilities with porous borders to the outside world—and highlights the need for more proactive disease surveillance and other precautions, experts said. Should we freak out about this? No, said Dr. Chrissy Eckstrand, a veterinary pathologist at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University. But should we stay vigilant and prepared? I think absolutely we should. Mink mortality In Spain, the first signs of trouble came during the first week of October, when the mortality rate spiked on a mink farm in Carral. At first, the deaths were confined to a subset of the farm's barns, which collectively housed more than 50,000 mink. But in the weeks that followed, the outbreak spread throughout the entire farm. The mechanism of transmission inside the farm is still unknown, but it's clear that the virus was able to move, said Dr. Isabella Monne, a veterinarian at the European Union Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease, and an author of the Eurosurveillance paper. Laboratory testing revealed that the mink were infected with H5N1, and all the animals were subsequently culled. Precisely how the virus got into the mink remains unknown. Farmed mink, including those on the Spanish farm, are often fed raw poultry, which presents a potential risk. If they were to be given infected poultry and poultry byproducts with an avian influenza strain, those mink could potentially get avian influenza, said Dr. Casey Barton Behravesh, who directs the One Health Office at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But in this case, there was no evidence that the poultry farms that supplied feed to the mink farms had experienced avian influenza outbreaks, and scientists said that the most likely source of the virus was a wild bird. In the weeks before the mink farm outbreak, the virus was detected in wild birds in the region. And the mink on the Spanish farm were housed in barns that were not completely enclosed on the sides. That is a common feature of mink barns, which are generally left partially open to improve airflow, said Dr. Kuiken, who has studied the possibility of coronavirus transmission between wild animals and farmed mink on Dutch mink farms. It was really quite disturbing to us to see how open they were to the environment, Dr. Kuiken said, and how easy it was for both mammals and wild birds to get into these mink farms and have contact with mink. Wild birds and other animals may be especially attracted by the minks' food, a meaty mush or paste that is typically smeared across the top of the animals' wire cages, experts said. It's like a free buffet for these animals to come and eat, Dr. Barton Behravesh said. (Dr. Monne stressed that wild birds were also victims of the virus, however, and should not be blamed or targeted.) Creature containment Mink are typically housed in high densities, with their cages close together. This housing arrangement, combined with a lack of genetic diversity among farmed mink, could make it easier for a virus that finds its way into a mink to spread quickly through a farm, scientists said. And once a virus starts to spread, it begins picking up new mutations and adapting to its new hosts. Indeed, researchers found that the flu virus they isolated from the mink in Spain had multiple mutations that set it apart from sequences isolated from birds. One of these mutations, in particular, has been previously shown to help influenza replicate better in mammalian cells. Still, the significance of some of the mutations remains unknown, and researchers cannot rule out the possibility that they were present in the virus before it found its way onto the farm, scientists cautioned. Globally, the H5N1 variant that has been spreading in birds has led to fewer than 10 known cases in people since December 2021, and there have been no documented instances of human-to-human transmission, according to the C.D.C. The H5 virus is not well adapted to humans, said Dr. Jim Lowe, a veterinarian at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The fact that the virus showed up on a mink farm is not particularly surprising, he said, and not necessarily cause for alarm. It's not, in my mind, a particularly worrisome situation for human health, Dr. Lowe said. Obviously it's not very good for the mink. But a mink-adapted version of the virus could present a greater potential risk to people. It's more likely that such a virus will be more easily, efficiently spread among humans, Dr. Kuiken said. Eleven farm workers had contact with the mink; all tested negative for the virus, Dr. Monne and her colleagues reported. That fact is reassuring, Dr. Monne said. But clearly, what is worrisome is that this virus is spreading everywhere. That means that there will be more opportunities for the virus to infect, and potentially spread, in mink and other mammals. The permeability of mink farms also means that a virus that begins spreading in mink could make its way off the farm. Mink sometimes escape from farms, and dogs and cats on mink farms with coronavirus outbreaks have also been infected with the virus, scientists have found. These animals could potentially act as intermediate hosts, passing a mutated mink version of the virus on to humans or wild animals. In one recent study, Dr. Barton Behravesh and her colleagues used GPS collars to track the movements of free-roaming cats living on or around several Utah mink farms that had experienced coronavirus outbreaks. The cats roamed widely, the researchers found. They made frequent visits to the mink sheds, moved freely around affected farms, visited surrounding residential properties and neighborhoods on multiple occasions, Dr. Barton Behravesh said. Highly pathogenic avian influenza has not been detected on any mink farms in the United States to date, said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But with the virus so widespread, more proactive influenza surveillance—including regularly sampling animals for asymptomatic infections—is needed on mink farms, scientists said. Mink are definitely an animal that warrants heightened attention, Dr. Barton Behravesh said. Ensuring that mink have clean food and water sources and that farm workers adhere to basic hygiene and sanitation practices can also help reduce the risks on mink farms, experts said. But Dr. Kuiken said that more sweeping changes might be needed. You have to also think in the first place whether you want to have mink farms, he said. We need to be thinking much more about our human activities in a way that we try to prevent the problems that we're seeing, for example, with the emergence of infectious diseases, rather than trying to mitigate them or solve them after they've appeared.

{"id": "258", "title": "Tracking the bird flu, experts see a familiar threat �nd a virus whose course is hard to predict", "date": "2023-02-08", "fulltext": "Veteran influenza epidemiologist Keiji Fukuda remembers vividly when he first became fearful that a virulent bird flu virus, H5N1, might be on the verge of triggering a devastating pandemic. The virus, seemingly out of nowhere, did something bird flu viruses were thought not to be able to do. It infected 18 people, killing six of them. That happened in 1997, in Hong Kong. A quarter century later, H5N1 has returned to the headlines, with an outbreak at a Spanish mink farm reported in mid-January triggering the latest round of fears that the virus might be inching closer to acquiring the ability to easily transmit among humans. The mink outbreak is concerning, there is no doubt about that. Minks are closely related to ferrets, the animals most often used as a proxy for people when scientists study the characteristics of flu viruses. But it's important to remember that we've been somewhere like this before with this virus. Not precisely this spot H5N1 has a much larger geographic footprint now and it's been found to infect many more species of mammals. But there have been periods, some spanning years, when H5N1 was wreaking havoc, doing things that until that point had been thought to be out of reach for bird flu viruses, raising global concerns a pandemic might be right around the corner. And then, unexpectedly, it quieted down for a while. So while scientists who have been studying it for a couple of decades have a very healthy respect for H5N1, a number with whom STAT spoke are hedging their bets about the path H5 may be on. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine. Enter your email Privacy Policy \"I still think that this thing is as unpredictable as it has ever been,\" said Ron Fouchier, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam who moved into the field of influenza research, at Erasmus, because of the 1997 H5N1 outbreak. Scientists there, along with a colleague from Hong Kong, were the first to report that the virus was a bird flu virus. \"Trying to predict what H5N1 will do in the human population absolutely requires a great deal of scientific humility,\" cautioned Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. \"I will never, ever, take H5N1 for granted,\" he said. \"I just don't know what it's going to do.\" Fukuda, who in 1997 was an influenza scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was sent to Hong Kong by the agency to help in the investigation of that first outbreak. \"Everything was really new and the sense of things back then was that we were deeply, deeply afraid that this was the beginning of the next pandemic, of a really severe pandemic,\" said Fukuda, who later went to the World Health Organization, where he served for a time as an assistant director-general. He retired from Hong Kong University at the end of 2021. How does he feel about the latest act in the multi-act play that is H5N1's evolution, the spread into wild birds and poultry flocks throughout the Americas, and the lengthening list of mammalian species seen to have been infected with the virus? What does he think it portends? Fukuda gives the auditory equivalent of a shrug. \"Anyone who tries to predict anything about influenza is a bit foolish and hasn't been in the field very long,\" he said. \"I definitely have no idea what H5 is going to do, in 20 years whether we would have a similar discussion 'Oh is it ever going to do anything?' or if we'd be having a discussion saying 'Oh, my God, couldn't imagine that it was going to do that! That was really horrible,'\" Fukuda said. \"I think both of those discussions are plausible.\" STAT asked a number of experts, all of whom have been studying or following H5N1 for years, how they assess the current situation and how they'd describe their individual level of concern. None of them ever stopped worrying about H5N1. None of them like what they're seeing now. But most of them struggled to answer when asked if they are more worried now than earlier. Like in 2004, when a cluster of cases in a Vietnamese family raised the specter of limited person-to-person spread. Or 2005, when what was by then a poultry virus moved back into wild birds, which spread it to North Africa, Turkey and Europe. Or in the mid-to-late teens, when Egypt recorded more than 250 human cases in unsettling succession, 93 of them fatal. Since the 1997 outbreak, about 870 confirmed human cases have been detected. Just over half of those people died from the infection. UPCOMING EVENT STAT in DC: The Politics of Health Care On March 7, join STAT for a deep dive into the biggest discussions and decisions taking place in Washington. Privacy Policy \"I grapple with this a little bit myself,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children's Hospital in Memphis. \"The way I look at the current situation, I don't think the virus itself is necessarily any more worrying than what we've been seeing for the past 20-plus years. But what worries me right now is that this is a change in the epidemiology and the ecology of the disease. So we're absolutely seeing more chances of people coming in contact with this virus.\" Fouchier agreed. \"For me, that risk hasn't changed. In '97 there was a pandemic threat. And that pandemic threat has continued to exist, and we cannot really quantify the threat because we still don't really understand what it takes,\" said Fouchier, who in 2011 showed that with some mutations, H5N1 viruses could gain the capacity to transmit easily among ferrets. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, did similar work and got the same result. Both scientists had to fight to publish their studies, because of concerns the so-called gain of function work could provide a dangerous how-to guide for bad actors. (The debate this work sparked continues to this day, and it constrains with good reason, critics say the research that can be done to delve into what is keeping H5 from becoming a human flu virus.) Related: The future of pandemic preparedness: agile coordination around clinical trials Malik Peiris, a professor of virology at Hong Kong University, does not view the mink farm outbreak in Spain as H5N1's third act. \"I mean to me it's just one big act,\" he said. The outbreak, which occurred in October, saw H5N1 viruses move about a large mink farm in Galicia, in the northwest of Spain, sickening and killing a number of the animals. Eventually all the remaining minks there were nearly 52,000 animals before the outbreak began were euthanized. It is not clear how the virus entered the farm. But it seems possible, perhaps even probable, that at some point H5N1 spread from mink to mink. \"Our findings also indicate that an onward transmission of the virus to other minks may have taken place in the affected farm,\" the scientists who reported the event wrote in the journal Eurosurveillance. \"This is suggested by the increasing number of infected animals identified after the confirmation of the disease and the progression of the infection from the initially affected area to the entire holding.\" The mere idea of mink-to-mink transmission gives flu researchers pause. If a virus can transmit from one mammal to another, what's to stop it from transmitting between other mammalian species like ours? The U.S. Department of Agriculture alone reports 110 reports of mammalian infections with H5N1 in 2022-2023 multiple types of bears, foxes, skunks, possums, raccoons, even seals. It's hard, though, to assess the significance of these infections in mammals. For starters, the virus has long had the capacity to infect mammals. Tigers and snow leopards in a zoo in Thailand died in late 2003 after being fed poultry infected with H5. Over the years infections in domestic cats and dogs, stone martens, and civet cats have been detected. \"We have been there. But we also shouldn't be lulled into complacency when there are new facts,\" said Kanta Subbarao, director of the WHO's Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne, Australia. Subbarao, who in 1997 was at the CDC, was the lead author on the first scientific publication characterizing the H5N1 virus. Related: Experimental flu vaccine, developed using mRNA, seen as potential game changer She said it's not clear if the virus is entrenched in some animal populations which she said would \"escalate our problems quite significantly\" or if there is just so much virus in wild bird populations at this point that carnivores are becoming infected because they happen upon and eat infected birds. Even with the mink farm, one cannot say with certainty whether there was ongoing transmission or if the infected animals all had a common exposure, such as contaminated food they were fed poultry byproducts or contact with wild birds that could have moved about the netted cages the animals were housed in. Dead and sick birds infected with H5N1 were reported in the region in the weeks leading up to the outbreak. Webby doesn't like the sheer geographic spread of the virus and the increasing reports of spillover events instances when the bird virus infects mammals though he noted the viruses don't appear to have changed in significant ways. \"If we look at the virus and the sequence of it, there's nothing that suggests to us that it's become more infectious. But of course we don't know everything about that,\" he said. \"The virus may be the same, but there's just a whole lot more of it out there.\" \"So absolutely worried from this new development in the ecology, epidemiology,\" Webby said. \"But luckily nothing that's associated with that from the virologic side that has me running for the hills yet.\" One thing that does mitigate some of the concern is the fact that in recent years, there have been few human infections with H5N1. Whereas at points in the first two decades of this century it wasn't uncommon to have 20 or 30 cases a year, reports of human cases are rare these days, and often involve such mild disease it is not clear if the person who tested positive was infected or simply had viruses in their nostrils. A man in Colorado who was culling infected poultry last spring. Two poultry workers in Spain in November. A British man who had infected ducks in 2021. A recent H5 infection in a young girl reported from Ecuador is a rare severe case. One school of thought is that the decline in human cases is due to genetic changes in the virus that took place a while back. Related: The scientist behind Pfizer's Covid vaccine says a flu pandemic is only a matter of time For years, the internal genes of H5N1 were unchanging. Their origin was another bird flu virus, H9N2. Many, even most, of the human infections with bird flu viruses were caused by viruses that had that combination of internal genes from H9N2, Fouchier said. The current version of H5N1, known by the unwieldy name 2.3.4.4b, acquired other internal genes through reassortment, a gene-swapping process that can occur when multiple viruses infect a single host. \"If you like, the engine under the bonnet is different,\" Peiris said. Fouchier worries primarily at the moment about the virus' impact on biodiversity. Some species of wild birds are being decimated by the virus. But he also believes countries should be dusting off their pandemic influenza plans. \"There will be a new pandemic for sure. Whether it is this one, I don't know. But I think that the current situation is enough that countries actually [should] review their pandemic preparedness plans again,\" Fouchier said. None of the scientists quoted here would disagree. But Fukuda, and one of his former colleagues from the CDC, Tim Uyeki, think at this point the world would be better off focusing on spillover threats plural than one single type of bird flu. \"I think it's a major problem for the agricultural industry. And certainly there is a public health threat, but right now, it's probably low,\" said Uyeki, the chief medical officer of CDC's flu division. Uyeki joined the CDC the year after the 1997 outbreak, but was involved in the investigations of many of the outbreaks that happened from 2003 onward. Related: Why doesn't the U.S. have at-home flu tests? \"This is not the only virus that we should be concerned about for pandemic preparedness,\" he stressed. \"There are many other avian influenza A viruses circulating in birds and poultry that have sporadically transmitted to people and have caused a wide range of illness, including severe lower respiratory tract infection and fatal outcomes. And for that matter, if we even step back further and take a really big picture perspective... wherever you go in the world if you sample pigs, you will find swine influenza viruses.\" Fukuda said it would be short-sighted to focus solely on H5 bird flu, suggesting the world needs to invest more in being ready to detect and mitigate outbreaks caused by the array of animal viruses that could jump from animals to people and start transmitting among us. He worries that the Covid-19 experience, rather than strengthening our response capacity, has eroded political support for this type of work. And Osterholm worries about what the Covid pandemic has done to public support for public health. \"If we did have another pandemic right now I think it would be very difficult to get the public to do anything to try to limit or control transmission. That is to me a big setback,\" he said. Fukuda concurred. \"What has become clear to me over time is that the big challenge is not the viruses. That's not what gives me a pit in my stomach,\" he said. \"The real challenge is whether people, whether governments, whether policymakers have the ability to actually address the challenge in the way that needs to be done.

Four dead seals have tested positive for bird flu in Scotland, as the number of cases of highly pathogenic avian flu in mammals continues to grow globally with experts warning of a 'step-change' in its spread. The largest ever bird flu outbreak had already spilled over into otters and foxes in the UK, with about 70 mammals having tested positive for the (HPAI) H5N1 virus. The seal carcasses were sent for screening last year and the results have come back positive, according to the Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme (SMASS). 'Three out of the four harbour seals and one of the two grey seals from 2021 and early 2022 tested positive for HPAIV H5N1,' said SMASS in a statement. The animals were found in Aberdeenshire, Highlands, Fife and Orkney. 'We also want to check our more recent cetacean cases for evidence of spillover,' it said. As well as ripping through wild bird populations around the world, H5N1 has been found in dolphins, domestic cats, leopards and grizzly bears. Earlier this week the Peruvian government said nearly 580 sea lions had died from it in seven protected marine areas. Generally it is believed mammals are getting infected by scavenging on dead or sick wild birds, but sea lions live in colonies. This has raised concerns it could now be spreading within mammal populations in the wild. Scientists are analysing the genetic sequences of the virus in the colonies in Peru to establish if that is the case. 'We need to wait for that analysis,' said Prof Ian Brown, the director of scientific services at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha). 'I think we need to be cautious before we assume viruses transmitting between the sea lions.' It follows an outbreak at a mink farm in Spain, which was the first indication it could be spreading within mammal populations. It is believed the American mink were infected by H5N1 after coming into contact with wild gulls who were able to access their food. More than 50,000 mink were euthanised. The evidence suggests it was spreading between the mink themselves, says Ursula Höfle, a research professor at the University of Castilla. 'It looks like it was at least for this particular virus an isolated event,' she said. 'We don't really know, but there's definitely increasing evidence for bird-to-mammal and mammal-to-mammal transmission.' If it starts being able to spread between mammals there are concerns humans could be more vulnerable. 'We're seeing a bit of a step-change in the spread of this infection, and we shouldn't sit idle because obviously we know what happened with Covid,' said Brown. He said it was possible to start taking preparatory steps for making a human vaccine for H5N1 but it would be 'foolhardy' to make a vaccine now as it was impossible to know what strain might jump into humans, in the unlikely event that did happen. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the situation 'needs to be monitored closely' but the risk to humans remained low. Experts say the virus would probably require more than one or two changes for human-to-human transmission to be a real risk, but the impacts could be huge. There have been nearly 870 cases of bird flu in humans over the past 20 years and 457 were fatal, according to the WHO. The virus is also devastating wild bird populations across the globe, meaning it is reaching places previously never exposed to such diseases. This means they can carry it to the most pristine parts of the planet, possibly spreading it into other endangered species. Brown said: 'I think it is really quite a worry that the virus has already reached so far down into South America. And we have to consider that there are definitely risks for some biodiversity in terms of Antarctica. It really is a concern to think that it can end up in a place like Antarctica.'

{"id": "260", "title": "Can humans and pets catch bird flu? What to know about the outbreak.", "date": "2023-02-10", "fulltext": "An outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain is decimating wild and farmed bird populations globally, fueling a debate about the most effective ways to end it and the potential risk to humans. Some experts are concerned about the possibility that the H5N1 virus could one day evolve to more easily spread from birds to mammals. Although the risk to humans remains low, speculation about the virus has caused worry that the bird flu outbreak could develop into a larger threat. The Washington Post spoke to a number of experts to answer common questions about bird flu, the risk to humans and pets, and how the outbreak is affecting food prices. Here's what they had to say. What is bird flu? Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in about 6,000 wild birds and affected more than 58 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since the start of 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"It's been the most serious outbreak for birds that we've had in the U.S. of these highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in recent memory,\" said Nicole Nemeth, an associate professor of pathology and head of the wildlife research and diagnostic service at the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm. How does bird flu affect humans? It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds—whether the birds are dead or alive—or with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces. Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks—probably from eating infected wild birds—experts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. In fact, since the start of the current outbreak, only one human case has been reported in the United States. People who work closely with infected poultry are at an increased risk of becoming infected. Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis—an eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes—to more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said. The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain. A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus—by sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example—to develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. \"In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia,\" he said, and then \"the fatality rate is very high.\" Human-to-human transmission of the virus is very rare, Schaffner said. \"If that happens, that human being is usually a very close caregiver of the sick person,\" he said. What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans? Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms—fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing. The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the last 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said. Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat. How is it treated? People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said. Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans? Yes. Federal authorities have vaccines against A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) bird flu viruses that could be used if these viruses were to start spreading among the human population, the CDC said. Can bird flu kill humans? Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare. According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and 2023, there were 868 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 globally. Of those who were infected, 53 percent—or 457—died. Between 2021 and 2022, six confirmed cases of human bird flu infections were reported to the WHO, and two of those infected died. While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Could bird flu become the next pandemic? Each time there is a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person. That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people—a statistical phenomenon,\" Schaffner said. Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchange of genetic material is a random event. \"If anything, the odds are against it,\" Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although this strain has infected some mammals—including mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm—that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans,\" he said. Can dogs and cats catch bird flu? Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said. Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons. \"If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection,\" Cardona said. Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs? No. Humans cannot become infected by eating eggs or fully cooked poultry. However, according to the CDC, \"uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia.\" The CDC advises that \"it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States.\" Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry—and other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry—are typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. \"That's why there's so much death associated, in many ways,\" to the current outbreak, she said. \"It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products. They don't even make it into your pet food.\" What about my backyard chickens? People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said. Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease. Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying. People who have backyard chickens should still take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said. Has bird flu affected food prices? The outbreak drove up the price of Thanksgiving turkeys in November, but its impact continues to affect egg prices, which is dealing with a number of supply chain issues as well. According to the Agriculture Department, the bird flu has wiped out more than 44 million egg-laying hens, or roughly 4 to 5 percent of production. Does risk vary by state or country? Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk-free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. \"The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable,\" Iqbal said. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world. Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu? China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have also focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality. But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks. The United Kingdom, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly. Amid the current H5N1 outbreak, some European countries, including France and the Netherlands, are testing the effectiveness of bird vaccination. In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds who may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed.", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": "same problems", "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate of 53% for H5N1 cases.

World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that the risk to humans remains low but added, \"we cannot assume that will remain the case.\" As with the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 that is believed to have started in animals before spreading to humans, some animal viruses can mutate, jump species to make humans sick and spread quickly around the world. But highly pathogenic avian influenza is no Covid-19. Scientists are reassuring the public that, with a few rare exceptions, the virus hasn't made the jump to humans at a large enough scale to trigger an outbreak. It has gone far beyond birds, though, and its recent spread among members of a separate species has some experts concerned about the way the virus is changing. What is bird flu? Avian flu is a type A influenza virus that originated in birds. The version that's predominantly causing problems in the Americas and Europe is called H5N1. There are several subtypes, and H5N1 bird flu viruses commonly in circulation now are genetically different from earlier versions of the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since late 2022, scientists have detected this virus in more than 100 species of wild birds like ducks, seagulls, geese, hawks and owls in the US. Globally, this strain of the virus has actually been around a lot longer, said Richard Webby, an infectious disease researcher at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and director of WHO's Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. \"We saw the sort of great-great-granddad of the virus in the late 1990s in Southeast Asia, and we've been following its evolution and change ever since,\" Webby said.", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that the risk to humans remains low but added, 'we cannot assume that will remain the case.'", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "As with the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 that is believed to have started in animals before spreading to humans, some animal viruses can mutate, jump species to make humans sick and spread quickly around the world.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Its recent spread among members of a separate species has some experts concerned about the way the virus is changing.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "H5N1 bird flu viruses commonly in circulation now are genetically different from earlier versions of the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "affirm_why_count": 3, "affirm_keywords_statement_2": "But highly pathogenic avian influenza is no Covid-19.", "affirm_keywords_count": 1, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_statement_1": "Scientists are reassuring the public that, with a few rare exceptions, the virus hasn't made the jump to humans at a large enough scale to trigger an outbreak.", "deny_why_count": 1, "deny_keywords_statement_1": "But highly pathogenic avian influenza is no Covid-19.", "deny_keywords_count": 1}
{"id": "263", "title": "Egg Prices Have Soared Over the Past Year. Here Is Why They Are So Expensive. Avian-flu outbreak keeps supply of the grocery staple tight", "date": "2023-02-16", "fulltext": "Egg prices are high as the deadliest avian-influenza outbreak on record devastates poultry flocks across the U.S. The price of eggs rose 8.5% in January compared with the month before and was up about 70% from the prior January, according to the latest consumer-price index, a measurement of what consumers pay for goods and services. Overall food prices rose 10.1% in January, compared with a year ago, according to federal data. Here is what you should know. What are egg prices now? Wholesale egg prices have dropped from record highs in December, but the grocery staple remains more expensive than usual and continues to squeeze consumer budgets. The price of eggs rose more than any other grocery item in 2022, according to Information Resources Inc. Wholesale prices of Midwest large eggs hit a record $5.46 a dozen in December, according to the research firm Urner Barry. Those prices have declined to $2.35 a dozen, according to Urner Barry, but are still higher than $1.30 a dozen in January 2022. Retail prices for a dozen regular eggs have stayed in the $4 range since late December but are declining, NielsenIQ data show. A dozen regular eggs sold for $4.13 for the week ended Feb. 4, lower than $4.40 for the week ended Jan. 21. There is often a lag between wholesale prices—what suppliers charge—and the retail prices that consumers pay, as supermarkets try to sell through the inventory they have on hand, said Scott Karns, chief executive of Karns Foods in Pennsylvania. The grocer in February sold large eggs for $3.39 a dozen after paying a wholesale price of $2.75 for them, Mr. Karns said. Demand typically falls after the holiday season, a period when people bake more and eat warmer breakfasts. The decline has been steep this year as high prices have prompted more shoppers to buy fewer eggs. U.S. retailers sold about 12% fewer regular eggs for the week ended Feb. 4 compared with the same period a year ago, according to data from NielsenIQ. \"Retailers will be reluctant to bring prices back to 'normal' levels for quite some time,\" said Brian Earnest, an animal-protein economist at agricultural lender CoBank. Why are egg prices so high? Since the start of 2022, highly pathogenic avian influenza has led to the deaths of about 58 million birds. It is the deadliest outbreak of all time and the worst one since 2015, when 50 million birds were culled, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data. U.S. egg inventories were 29% lower in the final week of December 2022 than at the beginning of 2022, according to the USDA. More than 43 million egg-laying hens had died as a result of the malady by the end of December. \"Lower-than-usual shell egg inventories near the end of the year, combined with increased demand stemming from the holiday baking season, resulted in several successive weeks of record-high egg prices,\" USDA economists said in a January research note. Egg prices have also increased as part of overall food inflation driven by rising costs of labor, ingredients and logistics. Higher feed and transportation costs for producers mean shoppers will continue to face elevated egg prices even when the bird flu's effects diminish, said CoBank's Mr. Earnest. Why is this bird-flu outbreak so deadly? Agriculture industry officials and analysts have attributed the rapid spread of the virus to wild birds carrying it to farms as they migrate. To limit the spread of the virus, whole poultry flocks are killed after an infection is confirmed. While the 2015 outbreak ended in June of that year, cases in 2022 continued to appear in various parts of the country throughout the fall and winter. Poultry processors invested in new biosecurity measures and other precautions to mitigate the spread between farms. However, spreading the virus can be as simple as a worker stepping on wild-bird fecal matter and forgetting to clean his or her boots before entering a commercial barn—leading to the death of an entire flock. What is the bird flu? Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease in birds that can sicken and kill certain domesticated species, including chickens and turkeys. It has a mortality rate of nearly 100% in chickens, often leading to death within 48 hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Wild aquatic birds, especially certain ducks, are considered hosts for avian-influenza A viruses. Some species, such as ducks, might not get sick and spread the disease to birds raised on farms, according to the CDC. To prevent the disease from spreading, commercial flocks are culled using methods such as suffocating birds with foam, and by using carbon-dioxide gas, according to the Agriculture Department. The USDA compensates farmers for the birds and eggs destroyed. Is there an egg shortage? There have been spotty shortages of eggs, but not a widespread one. The American Egg Board, which represents egg producers, has said shortages are rare. According to the Egg Board, farms are recovering faster than they did in 2015, bouncing back after an outbreak in roughly three months. Recovering from the previous outbreak took farms six to nine months. Kroger Co., the nation's biggest supermarket chain, said its egg supply remains adequate, while some regional chains have said they are dealing with intermittent shortages. Organic eggs and other specialty eggs, which are sold to retailers and distributors on a fixed-price basis, have sometimes been cheaper than conventional varieties in recent months. Organic eggs have been harder to find in some instances because retailers are seeking to stock more of them. What are supermarkets and food companies doing about the egg situation? Because eggs are a staple product for U.S. consumers, grocers try to keep prices competitive. In fact, some retailers said they have sacrificed some profits on eggs for months to keep prices on shelves as low as possible. There aren't many substitutes for eggs. Supermarket operators have said they are trying to secure more plant-based egg alternatives or specialty varieties such as organic eggs. The largest U.S. egg producer, Cal-Maine Foods Inc., has said that the avian-influenza outbreak will keep the overall supply of eggs tight until the national egg-laying chicken flock is replenished. What alternatives do I have right now? You don't have many obvious options, but you could try vegan egg substitutes or liquid eggs. Privately held Eat Just Inc. said sales of its plant-based Just Egg brand grew steadily in 2022 as conventional egg prices rose. The California company said sales of its Just Egg Folded breakfast product grew nearly 24% for the 52 weeks that ended Dec. 31. About 10% of Just Egg's pourable product sales last year were from consumers switching from buying conventional shell eggs, a company spokesman said. Some food distributors are selling different formats of eggs. Gordon Food Service Inc. said it offers liquid eggs that are cheaper than shell eggs. Liquid eggs are an option for omelets and scrambled eggs, the company said, though they can't be used for a sunny side-up egg. What if I'm feeling creative? People are testing everything from peanut butter and avocado to chickpea liquid and bananas in place of eggs. Vegans and people with dietary restrictions have tried these substitutes, and regular egg eaters are getting into the act, too. Just be aware that it could take some practice to perfect your eggless recipe. Eggs provide structure, bind together liquids and fats and add texture, and depending on substitutes or their ratios, you might end up with runny batter or a chewy cake. So, should I raise my own chickens? Sure, but it might be harder than you think. Maintaining a coop can be tricky and you might not break even on the price of eggs. The price of feed and coops has gone up along with egg prices. Other costs include heating and fencing. Most chickens don't start laying until between 18 and 22 weeks of age and take the winter off laying, meaning you might pay for feeding and housing expenses without getting a return on your investment. What other products are affected? The supply of turkeys is also tight, with the avian flu leading to the deaths of about 10 million commercial turkeys, according to the USDA. Turkey-breast-meat prices in the spring of 2022 climbed above $6.50 a pound, an all-time high, and have stayed elevated since, according to federal data. Executives at Hormel Foods Corp., the second-largest turkey processor by volume behind Butterball LLC, said in a November earnings call that lower turkey production is expected through at least the first half of 2023. \"Breast-meat prices remain historically high and have yet to moderate,\" said Jacinth Smiley, Hormel's chief financial officer, in November.

{"id": "264", "title": "Bird Flu Leaves the World With an Existential Choice", "date": "2023-02-17", "fulltext": "After three bleak years, the coronavirus pandemic is finally drawing to a close, but pandemics as a general threat very much are not. At the moment, the most pressing concern is H5N1, better known as bird flu. Public-health experts have worried for decades about the virus' potential to spark a pandemic, and the current strain has been devastating global bird populations—not to mention spilling over into assorted mammalian hosts—for more than a year. But those worries became even more urgent in mid-October, when an outbreak of the virus on a Spanish mink farm seemed to show that the mink were not only contracting the disease but transmitting it. Occasional spillover from birds to mammals is one thing; transmission among mammals—especially those whose respiratory tracts resemble humans' as closely as mink—do—is another. 'I'm actually quite concerned about it,' Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, told me. 'The situation we're in with H5 now, we have not been in before, in terms of how widespread it is, in terms of the different hosts it's infecting.' What's hard to gauge at this point, Webby said, is the threat this spread poses to humans. That will depend on whether we can transmit the virus to one another and, if so, how efficiently. So far the risk is low, but that could change as the virus continues to spread and mutate. And the kind of research that some scientists say could allow us to get a handle on the danger is, to put it mildly, fraught. Those scientists think it's essential to protect us from future pandemics. Others think it risks nothing less than the complete annihilation of humanity. Which way you feel—and how you think the world should approach pandemic preparedness as a whole—comes down to which type of pandemic you think we should be worried about. The point of the research in question is to better understand pandemic threats by enhancing deadly viruses. This is done in a highly controlled laboratory setting, with the aim of better preparing for these pathogens out in the world. This type of science is often referred to as gain-of-function research. If that term sounds familiar, that's probably because it has been invoked constantly in debates about the origins of COVID-19, to the point that it has become hopelessly politicized. On the right, gain-of-function is now a dirty term, inextricable from suspicions that the pandemic began with a lab leak at China's Wuhan Institute of Virology, where researchers were doing experiments of just this sort. (Solid evidence points toward the competing theory: that the coronavirus jumped to people from animals. But a lab leak hasn't totally been ruled out.) As a category, gain-of-function actually encompasses a far broader range of research. Any experiment that genetically alters an organism so that it does something it didn't before—that is, gains a function—is technically gain-of-function research. All sorts of experiments, including many of those used to produce antibiotics and other drugs, fall into this category. But the issue people fret about is the enhancement of pathogens that, if released into the world, could conceivably kill millions of people. When you put it that way, it's not hard to see why this work makes some people uncomfortable. Despite the inherent risks, some virologists told me, this sort of research is crucial to preventing future pandemics. 'If we know our enemy, we can prepare defenses,' the Emory University virologist Anice Lowen told me. The research enables us to pinpoint the specific molecular changes that allow a virus capable of spreading among animals to spread among humans; our viral surveillance efforts can then be targeted to those adaptations in the wild. We can get ahead on developing countermeasures, such as vaccines and antivirals, and ascertain in advance how a virus might evolve to circumvent those defenses. This is not merely hypothetical: In the context of the bird-flu outbreak, Lowen said, we could perform gain-of-function experiments to establish whether the adaptations that have allowed the virus to spread among mink enhance its ability to infect human cells. In fact, back in 2011, two scientists separately undertook just this sort of research, adapting H5N1 to spread among ferrets, whose respiratory tract closely resembles our own. The research demonstrated that bird flu could not only spill over into mammalian hosts but, under the proper circumstances, pass between mammalian hosts—just as it now seems to be doing—and perhaps even human ones. The backlash to this research was swift and furious. Critics—and there were many—charged that such experiments were as likely to start a pandemic as to prevent one. Top flu researchers put a voluntary moratorium on their work, and the National Institutes of Health later enacted a funding moratorium of its own. With the imposition of stricter oversight regimens, both eventually lifted and the furor subsided, but researchers did not race to follow up on the two initial studies. Those follow-ups could have given us a better sense of the likelihood that H5N1 might develop the ability to transmit between humans, Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatchewan, Canada, told me. 'That moratorium really did have a big chilling effect,' she said. 'We haven't really been looking at the determinants of mammal-to-mammal transmission, and that's the thing that we really need in order to understand what the risk is to the human population.' The controversy over the origins of the coronavirus pandemic has renewed calls for gain-of-function bans—or at least additional oversight. Last month, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity delivered a set of recommendations that, if adopted, would tighten regulations on all sorts of virology research. Piled on top of more widespread anti-science rhetoric throughout the pandemic, the recommendations have contributed to a sense of embattlement among virologists. The advisory board is 'responding to a lot of hyperbole without any real evidence,' Seema Lakdawala, a flu-transmission expert at Emory University, told me. But other researchers—those more on the 'fear the annihilation of humanity' side of the aisle—see the recommendations as progress, important if not anywhere near sufficient. 'Laboratory accidents happen,' Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University who earlier this month co-founded an anti-gain-of-function biosecurity nonprofit, told me. 'They actually happen on a remarkably frequent basis.' The 1977 flu pandemic, which killed roughly 700,000 people, may well have started in a laboratory. Anthrax, smallpox, and other influenza strains have all leaked, sometimes with deadly consequences. The original SARS virus has done so too—several times, in fact, since its natural emergence in 2003. And we might never know for sure how the coronavirus pandemic began. (This lack of definitive evidence has not stopped Ebright from tweeting that NIH officials potentially share the blame for the millions of deaths COVID-19 has caused worldwide.) To researchers in this camp, the benefits of experimenting with such dangerous pathogens simply do not justify the risks. Sure, identifying mutations that could lead to transmissibility among humans might be marginally beneficial to our surveillance efforts, Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary biologist at MIT, told me, but viruses can make that jump via innumerable genetic pathways, and the odds of our hitting on one that's ultimately relevant are tiny. In the case of bird flu, researchers told me, the mutations that appear to have made the virus transmissible among mink are not the mutations identified in the 2011 studies. This sort of research, Ebright said, 'has existential risk, but effectively no benefit or extremely marginal benefit.' Huge numbers of lives are at stake. The world has just lost millions to the coronavirus. Imagine the same again, or even much worse, due to our own folly. Even if we managed to swiftly contain an outbreak, Esvelt worries, the mere perception of a lab leak could irreparably damage the public trust and lead people to question far safer pandemic precautions. More doubts, more deaths. 'Double or nothing doesn't even begin to describe it,' Esvelt told me. 'I'm just not comfortable risking so much of the biomedical enterprise on that toss of the dice.' But a lab leak isn't Esvelt's main concern. What really worries him is bioterrorism. Imagine that researchers identify a pandemic-capable virus and share its genome sequence, as well as all the information necessary to replicate it, with the scientific community. Other scientists begin developing countermeasures, but now hundreds or even thousands of people have the ability to make something with the potential to kill millions; it's not exactly a well-kept secret. Someone goes rogue, replicates the virus, releases it in an international-airport terminal, and, just like that, you've got a pandemic. Esvelt compares the danger to that of nuclear proliferation; in his view, nothing else comes close in sheer destructive capacity. Part of what's so tricky about this whole debate is that, unlike most competing public-health priorities, the question of whether to conduct this research is inherently zero-sum, in the sense that we can't have it both ways. If we do the research and publish the results, we might improve our chances of preventing natural pandemics, but we necessarily create a security risk. If we don't do the research, we don't create the security risk, but we also don't reap the preventive benefits. We have to choose. To do so with any degree of certainty, Esvelt told me, we'd need to put hard numbers to the risks and benefits of bringing a dangerous pathogen into a lab. So far, he said, few people have done that math. Plenty of researchers, he thinks, may not even realize the trade-off exists: 'If you're the kind of person that has dedicated your life to working in comparative obscurity on a shoestring budget, trying to prevent a calamity with no real hope of reward or recognition, the very possibility that humans could be malevolent enough to deliberately cause the catastrophe that you fear—honestly, I think they're such good people that it just never occurs to them.' The gain-of-function proponents I spoke with were by no means naive to the threat of bioterrorism. 'It's both presumptuous and patronizing to suggest that biosecurity risks never occur to virologists,' Rasmussen said. She pointed out that lab members undergo background checks and receive regular training on mitigating security risks (blackmail, extortion, etc.). Excessive oversight poses its own threat, her camp argues. The risk, Lowen told me, is that we 'lose the war against infectious diseases by winning a battle on research safety.' 'There is a great threat out there from nature,' she said. 'Relative to that, the threat from laboratory accidents is small.' Regardless of who's right, Esvelt's broader point is a good one: How you feel about this research—and which kind of pandemic worries you most—is, in the end, a question of how you feel about human nature and nature nature and the relation between the two.

{"id": "265", "title": "Why sick minks are reigniting worries about bird flu", "date": "2023-02-18", "fulltext": "NEW YORK (AP) — A recent bird flu outbreak at a mink farm has reignited worries about the virus spreading more broadly to people. Scientists have been keeping tabs on this bird flu virus since the 1950s, though it wasn't deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong among visitors to live poultry markets. As bird flu hits more and varied animals, like at the mink farm, the fear is that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic. Scientists say another kind of bird flu was likely behind the devastating 1918-1919 flu pandemic, and avian viruses played roles in other flu pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009. Still, the risk to the general public now is low, says Dr. Tim Uyeki of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A look at the bird flu virus and why it is getting renewed attention: WHAT IS BIRD FLU? Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but some others chiefly occur in animals. For example, there are flus that occur in dogs, plus pig — or swine — flu viruses. And then there are avian viruses that spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry. The bird flu virus drawing attention today — type A H5N1 — was first identified in 1959, by investigators looking into a flu outbreak in chickens in Scotland. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself. By 2007, the virus was found in more than 60 countries. In the U.S., it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations or backyard flocks in 47 states. Since the beginning of last year, tens of millions of chickens have died of the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading, one of the reasons cited for soaring egg prices. HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE GET BIRD FLU? The Hong Kong outbreak in 1997 was the first time this bird flu was blamed for severe human illness. Out of 18 people infected, six died. To contain the outbreak, the Hong Kong government closed live poultry markets, killed all the birds in the markets, and stopped bringing in chickens from southern China. It worked, for a while. Symptoms are similar to that of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people don't have noticeable symptoms, but some develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia. Globally, nearly 870 human infections and 457 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization in 20 countries. But the pace has slowed and there have been about 170 infections and 50 deaths in the last seven years. In the vast majority of cases, the infected people got it directly from infected birds. The first and only U.S. case occurred just last April. A prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado, in the western part of the state. His only symptom was fatigue and he recovered. CAN IT SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE? In some instances, investigators concluded that the bird flu virus apparently did spread from one person to another. That happened in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, China and Pakistan, most recently in 2007. In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home. Scientists do not believe it can spread easily through casual contact, as seasonal flu can. But viruses mutate and change. Scientists worry about the ever-increasing number of opportunities for bird flu to mix with other flu viruses in infected people or animals and mutate, making it easier to spread to people. It wouldn't take much for that to happen \"and then we would be in a really tough situation,\" said Dr. Luis Ostrosky, chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. The CDC's Uyeki said the most worried he's been about H5N1 was during the earlier clusters. That kind of human-to-human spread does not appear to be happening right now, he said. WHAT HAPPENED AT THE MINK FARM? Recent concern among public health experts has been fueled, in part, by detection of infections in a variety of mammals. The growing list includes foxes, raccoons, skunks, bears and even marine mammals like seals and porpoises. Officials in Peru said three sea lions found dead in November tested positive for, and the recent deaths of hundreds of others may be due to bird flu. Then last month, a European medical journal reported on a bird flu outbreak in October at a mink farm in Spain with nearly 52,000 animals, where the illness spread like wildfire. The mink were fed poultry, and wild birds in the region had been found to have bird flu. But researchers said that however it started, they believe the virus then spread from mink to mink — a worrisome scenario. No workers were infected, though they wore masks as part of COVID-19 precautions. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, said the outbreak virus is being watched for mutations that could make it more easily transmitted to people, and potentially between people. \"That's the real worry,\" said Nuzzo. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

{"id": "266", "title": "Bird flu costs pile up as outbreak enters second year", "date": "2023-02-19", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The ongoing bird flu outbreak has cost the government roughly $661 million and added to consumers' pain at the grocery store after more than 58 million birds were slaughtered to limit the spread of the virus. In addition to the cost of the government response that the USDA tallied up and rising prices for eggs, chicken and turkey, farmers who raise those animals have easily lost more than $1 billion, said an agricultural economist, though no one has calculated the total cost to the industry yet. The bad news is that with the outbreak entering its second year and the spring migratory season looming, there is no end in sight. And there is little farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out. Unlike past years, the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a rise in cases reported in the fall. The outbreak is already more widespread than the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn't proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago. “The past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry's history,” National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said. In the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm — which can number in the millions — must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa — the nation's biggest egg producer — leads the nation with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered. In 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states. That previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn’t have any birds on their farms. This bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers. Egg prices shot up to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the latest government figures. That spike prompted calls for a price-gouging investigation although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what's driving prices so high. The price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That's down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound. The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t track retail turkey prices the same way as part of its inflation data, but the Agriculture Department says the wholesale price of turkey went from $1.29 per pound last January just before the bird flu outbreak began to $1.72 per pound last month. The number of birds slaughtered peaked last spring at almost 21 million in March, leaving farmers leery of what they must face in the months ahead. University of Georgia virus researcher David Stallknecht said there is some hope that this spring might not be quite as bad because turkeys and chickens may have developed some immunity to the virus. The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through their droppings and nasal discharges. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out. Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating. “We recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that's leading the government's response. Farmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity. “America’s egg farmers continue to double-down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply. We are grateful that there has been little to no farm-to-farm spread in this current outbreak,” said Oscar Garrison, senior vice president of food safety and regulatory affairs at the United Egg Producers trade group. Poultry and egg producers, partnering with the government, are parsing this outbreak for new lessons in keeping birds healthy. “That's really the key — early detection. It’s kind of like a forest fire - the earlier you detect it, the easier it is to contain and eradicate,” National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said. Officials say bird flu doesn’t represent a significant threat to human health. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation’s food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.

Scientists are searching for evidence of transmission between humans. Here's what you need to know. Cambodia has reported two cases of bird flu infection in people, a father and daughter in a village in the country's Prey Veng province. The 11-year-old girl died earlier this week. The cases, the first reported in Cambodia since 2014, have raised fears that the virus has acquired the ability to spread among people and may trigger another pandemic. The Cambodian government is testing 11 other people, four of whom have flulike symptoms, for infection with the H5N1 flu virus. The 49-year-old father has tested positive but was not showing any symptoms, according to the health ministry. The World Health Organization is working closely with the Cambodian government to determine whether the father and daughter each acquired the virus by direct contact with infected birds -- the most likely possibility -- or whether they infected each other. Experts urged caution, noting that there have been hundreds of sporadic cases of H5N1 infection in people since the virus was first identified but no evidence that it has become particularly well adapted to humans. Transmission among people is 'very, very rare, versus a common source of infection,' said Richard Webby, a bird flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and an adviser to the W.H.O. But people should take care to avoid contact with wild birds that may be infected, Dr. Webby said.

{"id": "269", "title": "Lateral flow tests being prepared for UK outbreaks of avian flu", "date": "2023-02-26", "fulltext": "After a girl in Cambodia died from H5N1, the UK Health Security Agency is on alert but says human-to-human transmission is rare. British health officials are preparing plans to deploy lateral flow tests if signs emerge that avian flu has begun to spread from one person to another. The programme would provide rapid information about the dangers posed by the disease. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is also working on blood tests to detect antibodies against the virus and officials will analyse the disease's genetic mutations to reveal data about the increased risk to human health from avian flu. The moves follow last week's news that an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia has died from H5N1, the flu strain that is being spread around the globe by migrating birds and is infecting poultry farms. Investigators are now trying to establish if infected birds were the cause of the Cambodian case, rather than human-to-human transmission. At present, evidence suggests the H5N1 virus does not pass easily to people although scientists have urged care and caution. 'Viruses constantly evolve, and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population,' said Dr Meera Chand, incident director for avian influenza at the UKHSA. This point was backed by Professor Ian Brown of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). 'There have been over 850 cases in humans across the globe since 1996 with a high case-fatality rate. Almost all cases to date have not resulted in human-to-human transmission but vigilance is required.' Scientists also warned last week that although direct risks of infection were low, people should avoid contact with sick or dead wild birds in public areas such as parks or waterways and should wash their hands after feeding wild birds. Last week, the UKHSA confirmed it had found avian flu cases in poultry at 145 premises and in 656 wild birds in England, a rise of 15 new premises and 209 detections in wild birds since December 2022. In addition, 14 out of 134 wild mammals collected since October 2021 were found to have avian flu: four in foxes in England and one in Wales. In Scotland, there were four cases in otters, four in seals and one in a fox. 'This virus keeps cropping up in various mammals and this could increase the possibility of further human infections,' said Prof Jonathan Ball, of Nottingham University. 'The risk to humans is still very low, but it's important that we continue to monitor circulation of flu in both bird and mammal populations.' The human Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 50 million people, is believed to have been triggered by a successful transmission of an avian flu virus to humans. 'The initial strain then adapted and became endemic in the human population, giving rise to the seasonal flu viruses,' said Professor Massimo Palmarini, director of the Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow University.

{"id": "270", "title": "As bird flu surges, the nightmare scenario of another pandemic illustrates just how poorly prepared America would be.", "date": "2023-02-26", "fulltext": "Whatever happened to our Roaring Twenties? In the first year of the pandemic, it was common to hear predictions that however brutal and harrowing the near future seemed, the world would find itself, at some point, celebrating the end of Covid-19 -- perhaps in a grand bacchanal to recall the dizzying decade that followed the Spanish flu of 1918 and 1919, which killed 675,000 Americans. But that end never really came, not definitively. That the pandemic is no longer seen as an emergency is obvious; just look outside. But the country didn't turn the page so much as limp forward, through a fog of exhaustion and loneliness and long Covid, into the dawn of a new period in which the coronavirus has retreated for most as an everyday threat but may well nevertheless continue as gothic background noise, killing tens of thousands of Americans each year. A true postpandemic period may still arrive, perhaps even a real Roaring Twenties. But in recent weeks, as researchers have registered one after another mammalian outbreak of the avian influenza H5N1, another possibility has loomed into view, as well: a back-to-back pandemic, potentially driven by a disease that, over the past several decades, has killed about half the humans with known infections. There have been few cases of human-to-human transmission of bird flu, which is the main reason its incursion into human populations has been so limited. The World Health Organization has said that the risk to humans is low, but also that 'we must prepare for any change in the status quo.' There are reasons to think that, if the virus did make such an evolutionary jump, it could bring with it a significant reduction in severity. We also don't know exactly how rapidly such a disease would be transmitted among humans, though we have seen some eye-popping mammalian outbreaks over the last year: in minks, most notably, at a Spanish farm; but also in bears, seals, raccoons and foxes, to name just a few of those populations recently infected in the United States. In Peru, roughly 600 sea lions died. The possibility of a second pandemic raises the obvious question of whether we have learned anything from the last one. Is there any reason to expect that, even with new political leadership, the country's response to a new global outbreak -- of H5N1 or something else altogether -- would be more coherent or more coordinated? To the contrary, contemplating the possibility of a new pandemic in the near future suggests all the ways that America, in its rush to return to normal, failed to do all the things that might have secured a lasting normalcy. Consider the state of the country's institutional public-health apparatus: Since 2020, there has been no meaningful nationwide disease-surveillance network erected or even planned. (Our patchwork surveillance of avian flu has given us only a crude sense of where it is spreading now among animals.) The F.D.A. is still moving too slowly on some things and too quickly on others. There is no Operation Warp Speed-style funding plan for rapid vaccine development; indeed, the president who can claim credit for it has stopped touting it as one of his achievements. Billions of dollars in funding for things like air-filtration systems in schools have gone unspent, leaving public buildings no better prepared to endure airborne disease than they were before Covid. There has been little progress to date on lab safety -- which even lab-leak skeptics will acknowledge is an ongoing risk -- and early candidates for more expansive coronavirus vaccines, which could protect against many different pathogens in the same family as SARS-CoV-2, are only in early trials. (Pan-influenza vaccines are moving slowly, too.) As we now know all too well, pandemic containment isn't just a matter of policy and public investment. It's a complex web of leadership, social trust and public buy-in -- along with a fair amount of chance. But it is hard to believe that the country is now capable of more solidarity and vigilance than it was in early 2020. Vaccine skepticism may not necessarily outlast this pandemic, but the signs are worrying, and there has been precious little policy focus on what can overcome that skepticism. Faith in public-health officials' management of the pandemic has declined, too, and the Biden administration, which was champing at the bit on Inauguration Day, is now offering public-health guidance close to 'you do you' -- pulling back pandemic response, dumping millions of people off expanded Medicaid coverage and turning the provision of new tests and booster shots to the private market. There are some encouraging signs when it comes to bird flu: federal discussion of a mass poultry-vaccination program and the 'rapid' rollout of existing avian-influenza vaccines for humans. But each of these projects could take at least six months, and almost certainly we would find ourselves wasting the early stage of a new pandemic -- and possibly more than that -- relitigating debates over the last one. You can see the fault lines already, with those who believe the country's Covid response went too far taking to social media to mock the suggestion that any of the same measures -- social distancing, masking, school closures -- might be implemented to hold off a new contagion, as though it were irrelevant that this new one might be many times deadlier. Over time, fatality rates considerably higher than those encountered with Covid would (one hopes) shake a lot of the country's current mitigation fatalism -- because a disease that kills 5 percent of those infected looks very different from one that kills only 1 percent. But a deadlier pandemic would probably also, perversely, reignite arguments over our response to SARS-CoV-2, because such a fatality rate would make that disease look relatively mild -- and the global response to it much more significant -- by comparison. Beginning in 2020, Covid minimizers compared it to the flu, which kills a fraction as many (and tends to infect many fewer). If, in the next pandemic, fatality rates were five times higher, would minimizers dismiss it similarly -- 'It's just Covid'? Already, we've normalized quite a lot more dying than almost any American thought possible in early 2020, when the country bunkered down in response to warnings that the disease could kill 100,000 to 200,000 people. Normalization isn't just a matter of the vaccine skeptics in your timeline. On the campaign trail, Joe Biden declared that any president responsible for 220,000 American deaths should not remain president; he has now presided over 700,000. In 2020, we were panicked; now we're exhausted. In 2021, many doctors left the profession, and those still working are often reporting burnout. As many as half of nurses have reported in surveys that they are considering leaving the profession, as is one in five doctors. Even in the 'post-emergency' phase of the pandemic, national hospital capacity is under strain, and rural hospitals are closing at a distressing rate. This is not to say that, in facing any potential new pandemic, failure is inevitable. But even a limited outbreak, successfully contained through mitigation or outraced through rapid vaccine production, would still represent a grim premonition -- an unmistakable signal to many that the world has now entered what epidemiologists have been memorably calling the Pandemicine. That is, a new epoch, defined as much by the increasing frequency of viral spillover events as the Anthropocene has been defined by the human influence on the planet. When we give our era names like these, it makes the disjunctures seem inevitable, almost preordained. But human fallout from new disease is no more inevitable than from carbon emissions. Here, the cost of accumulated indifference could be similarly high, and not just in the obvious human toll. In welcoming eight billion of us unmistakably to a new pandemic age, a back-to-back outbreak would cast a sort of permanent viral shadow on the decades to come -- a legacy less like the Roaring Twenties than the Great Depression.

{"id": "271", "title": "Cambodia says recent bird flu cases not spread by humans", "date": "2023-03-01", "fulltext": "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Recent cases of bird flu discovered in two Cambodian villagers, one of them fatal, show no sign of human-to-human transmission, health officials in the Southeast Asian nation say, allaying fears of a public health crisis. An 11-year-old Cambodian girl from a village in the southeastern province of Prey Veng died Feb. 22 at a hospital in the capital, Phnom Penh, shortly after tests confirmed she had Type A H5N1 bird flu. Her father tested positive for the virus the day after her death, but showed no strong symptoms and was released Tuesday from a Prey Veng hospital where he had been kept isolated, the Health Ministry said. He was sent home after three negative tests. The two were the only villagers among more than two dozen tested who were found to carry the virus, the ministry said in a statement. Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads among poultry but can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. The recent detection of infections in a variety of mammals has raised concern among experts that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic. The Health Ministry said an investigation determined that the father and daughter had both been infected from poultry at their village, and there is no indication or evidence that there was infection from father to daughter. The conclusion that they were infected directly from birds was reached by experts from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as their Cambodian counterparts, Health Ministry spokesperson Ly Sovann told The Associated Press. In an interview published Tuesday on the website of the scientific journal Nature, a Cambodia-based virologist said the girl who died had been infected with a different strain of the bird flu virus than the one that has been spreading worldwide for the past year and a half among wild and domestic birds. Erik Karlsson of the Pasteur Institute of Cambodia in Phnom Penh was part of the team that tested the virus sample from the girl, and was cited as saying that it belongs to a virus group that has been found in chickens and ducks in the region for at least a decade. She was the first person in Cambodia since 2014 known to be detected with H5N1. He said it wasn't clear why the girl would have caught the virus after such a long time with no cases, but suggested it might be related to a lot of global changes in agricultural practices owing to the COVID-19 pandemic that could have created the conditions for a spillover. We know that, in Cambodia, the pandemic increased the amount of backyard poultry farming. Many people, for example tour guides, couldn't work and had to supplement their incomes and sources of food for their families, he was quoted saying. All over the world, people are still struggling, which has resulted in changes in agricultural practices that can increase spillover risk. And changes to people's health, for example malnutrition or being overweight, can make people more susceptible to getting infected. Eds: UPDATES: Links new photo.

{"id": "272", "title": "Vaccine Makers Are Preparing for Bird Flu", "date": "2023-03-02", "fulltext": "Minks in Spain, seals in Scotland, sea lions and dolphins in South America: a number of mammal species have recently been found to be infected with H5N1, a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza. Avian flu is not new; epidemiologists have been studying it for decades. But the detection of the virus in mammals has many concerned about the potential that it could spill over to humans and cause a larger outbreak. As the world enters the fourth year of a global pandemic caused by a virus that likely came from an animal, concern over another virus potentially uprooting our lives is valid. H5N1 has infected humans before, although human-to-human transmission has rarely been observed. And while the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the mortality rate of avian flu in humans is around 56 percent, many experts believe it's likely to be much lower if the virus becomes more transmissible. One reason avian flu is so lethal is that it infects the lower respiratory tract, which can lead to respiratory failure. If it were to mutate to infect the upper respiratory tract and spread more easily, it would probably cause milder illness. Yet even a virus that causes mild or moderate illness in many people can have a serious toll, as we've seen with the COVID pandemic. So efforts are underway to develop vaccines to protect against such a form of bird flu. Bird flu has spilled over to humans before—in fact, just last week a girl in Cambodia died from H5N1 (although not the same strain as the one that is sickening birds worldwide). \"Each time we see this happen, we get these spurts of cases, [and] people say, 'Here it comes; it's going to happen,'\" says Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. But he stressed that H5N1 is likely not an imminent threat to humans. Others agree. \"I'm keeping a close eye on it as an expert, but as a member of the community, as a parent and someone who [has been] recently experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm not worried about this right now,\" says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"This is an animal health issue right now that has a theoretical risk to become a human health issue.\" Avian influenza viruses infect birds by attaching to a receptor in their respiratory tract. In order for the virus to become a human virus and start circulating from person to person in the population, it would have to be able to attach itself to the human version of this receptor—something it hasn't yet evolved to do. \"It's a really dangerous time to be a bird,\" Andrew Pavia, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah, adds. \"But as of today, the risk to humans remains very low. Our concern is what's going to happen as it circulates more and more.\" It's unfortunately nearly impossible to predict when this jump could happen. \"None of us know when the next influenza pandemic will emerge. It could be tomorrow [or] it could be years from now, and we don't know which of the viruses will become the next pandemic virus,\" Osterholm says. \"At the outset, you have to say there is uncertainty, with one exception: there will be a pandemic.\" The U.S. is somewhat equipped to handle avian flu: there is a stockpile of egg-based flu vaccines for the H5N1 strain. Eggs are one of the most common ways to make a flu vaccine. To create it, manufacturers inject an inactivated or weakened virus into a fertilized chicken egg, incubate the egg for a few days while the virus multiplies and then harvest the virus to use for the vaccine. The country has a secret chicken stockpile in undisclosed locations across the U.S. just in case we need to make egg-based vaccines quickly—such as during a flu pandemic. It may be concerning that this vaccine strategy depends on an animal that is highly susceptible to the flu in question. But several experts told Scientific American that there are high levels of biosecurity at the chicken facilities in order to avoid bird flu contamination. Alternatives to egg-based vaccines exist. Since the early 2010s, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been partnering with CSL Seqirus, one of the largest influenza vaccine manufacturers, to develop vaccines grown in cells in a laboratory. The pandemic preparedness vaccine AUDENZ, which targets the H5N1 subtype specifically, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And although it's impossible to determine which virus will cause the next pandemic, CSL Seqirus has a library of viruses that have the potential to infect humans. And the company is constantly looking for candidate vaccine viruses that it can tailor to a specific pathogen. \"We use data [for] one of the avian strains to create a mock-up file,\" says Marc Lacey, who runs CSL Seqirus' pandemic preparedness and response team. The team members basically identify certain viruses, use them to create vaccines and conduct some of the early safety studies so that if an avian flu strain evolves into a true pandemic strain transmitting between humans, they will be ready to go with an adequate vaccine. Lacey says that his company would be able to supply the U.S. government with 150 million doses within the first six months of a pandemic being declared, but he thinks the scale-up potential could be higher, especially if multiple manufacturers could help produce it. Because there are eight billion people in the world, scale-up and widespread collaboration across countries would be necessary to make enough vaccine. There are also efforts to apply messenger RNA (mRNA) technology—such as that used for some of the COVID vaccines—to flu vaccines. According to University of Washington microbiologist Deborah Fuller, these efforts range from developing a universal flu vaccine to creating a \"multivalent\" vaccine that targets only a few subtypes—or versions of the virus (like a typical seasonal flu vaccine does). One advantage of mRNA technology is its speed of production. And because of the COVID pandemic, there is now more infrastructure to mass-produce doses. \"RNA vaccines can be designed extremely quickly—you only need the genetic sequence of what the new variant is that's emerging, and within weeks, [you] can have a vaccine already tested in animal models,\" Fuller says. Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, is also investigating mRNA flu vaccines. He's part of a research team developing a 20-subtype mRNA flu vaccine that includes an H5N1 strain (although not the one currently circulating in birds). The team recently published its findings in Science. Hensley's lab is now developing a single-strain vaccine tailored to the current bird flu strain—and is already testing it in laboratory animals. He emphasizes that, as with the COVID vaccines, his vaccines are meant to prevent serious illness and death, not infection. But even the 20-subtype vaccine is expected to provide some protection against the new strain. \"When we developed [that] vaccine, the idea was to create one that could induce a certain level of immune memory against every subtype,\" Hensley says. \"Our goal wasn't to predict which influenza subtype would cause the next pandemic or which strain would cause it. Rather the vaccine [would induce] some level of immune memory against every subtype so that it would limit disease and death caused by new pandemic strains.\" A vaccine is only part of pandemic preparedness—you also need effective treatments. As Pavia says, researchers aren't working from scratch trying to create something like the COVID antiviral Paxlovid, which took nearly two years to get to market. FDA-approved antivirals for influenza, such as Tamiflu, already exist and will be important for reducing deaths during a flu pandemic. Pavia is also hopeful that the U.S. could quickly adapt diagnostic tests to match an outbreak strain of pandemic flu. \"We have better tools and better knowledge about influenza than we did about coronaviruses. In many ways, we would be a step ahead,\" Pavia says. \"But what I worry about is our political capacity to respond. We need to continue to [increase] awareness and continue preparation efforts. And if things start to accelerate, we need a concerted, nonpoliticized effort to move quickly and effectively.\"", "media_outlet": "SciAm", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "yes", "comments": "will become more transmissible", "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate of 56% for avian flu.

{"id": "273", "title": "Bird flu is killing bald eagles at an 'alarming rate,' researchers say", "date": "2023-03-03", "fulltext": "Bald eagle nest failures and deaths are piling up at an 'alarming rate' as a result of the highly infectious avian influenza, University of Georgia researchers announced this week. The avian influenza strain known as H5N1 is killing an unprecedented number of mating pairs of the national symbol birds, University of Georgia researchers concluded in a study published in Nature's Scientific Reports. 'Even just one year of losses of productivity like we've documented regionally is very concerning and could have effects for decades to come if representative of broader regions,' said Nicole Nemeth, an associate professor at UGA's college of veterinary medicine, who led the study with 10 other researchers. 'There were nights where I couldn't sleep based on what we were hearing and seeing.' Are we ready: Is the US prepared for a possible bird flu pandemic? What we know. What did the research show? 'We had reports from people who faithfully monitor eagle nests year after year with these heartbreaking stories of an adult eagle found dead below their nest,' Nemeth said. 'Within a few days, often its mate and the chicks were also found dead below the nest. It is clear the virus is causing nest failures.' * Just under half the bald eagle nests in coastal Georgia fledged an eaglet in 2022, 30% below average for the season. * The influenza was documented in Georgia's bald eagles for the first time in April 2022 after dead eagles were found in Chatham, Glynn and Liberty counties in March. * The success rate for nests in one Florida County was 50% lower than average, dropping from an average of 86.5% to 41%. What about bald eagles elsewhere? There have been many reports of bald eagles dying across the U.S. and Canada, said Nemeth, a part of the University of Georgia's Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study. The study has diagnosed cases of the influenza in high numbers of bald eagles and other avian species from member states. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service also revealed the influenza is widespread in bald eagles, she said. Eagles and other raptors probably contract the virus by eating other diseased birds, federal officials say. BACKGROUND: Bird flu costs accumulate as avian influenza outbreak enters second year What other birds have been affected? Since it was first detected in the United States in January 2022, the H5N1 virus has exploded in birds across the country, federal data shows, but also infects other wildlife. Reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show the virus has: * Has struck more than 58 million domestic poultry animals, including chickens and turkeys, in 777 outbreaks. * Been the subject of 4,672 reports in wild birds. * Infected at least 146 avian species. * Been documented in every state but Hawaii and every Canadian province and territory. * Has spread to 17 other wildlife species in 22 states, including 60 red fox, 16 harbor seals and 14 striped skunks. * Nearly half the infected red foxes were reported in Michigan and Wisconsin. Nemeth suspects the number of wild bird cases 'is drastically underreported.' 'People will submit one snow goose, for example, and it will test positive for the virus,' she said. 'And then they'll tell you, 'Well, there are thousands of geese dying at the same site.' But it only goes down as one infected bird. 'We can't contain the virus, and we can't vaccinate wild birds,' Nemeth said. 'But we can document the losses and try to help conserve affected species and populations the best we can.' Experts say it's likely the virus is being spread when birds or other mammals eat infected birds. The virus affects birds by impairing their nervous systems and making them unable to fly. But some species are more susceptible than others, including the bald eagle. Click to view image.

Wild Isles, which premieres on Sunday, will be Attenborough's first landmark series on the natural history of Britain and Ireland. Filmed over the course of three years, the five-part series aims to shine a light on the challenges affecting the British Isles and celebrate nature that exists on our doorsteps. But according to the show's producer, filming on physically demanding terrain—including on the island of Skomer, off the west coast of Wales—meant plans had to be changed at the last minute to avoid seriously risking the 96-year-old's health. \"The shearwaters are not great at taking off, so what the warden on the island said is, 'If you sit David close to the burrows, they will almost certainly climb up his arm on to his head and take off from his head,'\" Alastair Fothergill told the Radio Times. \"We thought, 'Wow, that could be TV gold.' That was the plan.\" But it soon transpired that this could have seriously endangered Attenborough. Two weeks before filming was due to start, reports came in that bird flu had hit the neighboring island of Grassholm, which meant it could also be present on Skomer. \"I have an old friend who's an expert on infectious diseases and I rang him up for his opinion,\" Fothergill added. \"He said, 'Well, bird flu is actually extremely hard to catch, but if he [Attenborough] gets it he will die.' Last month it was reported that British health officials are preparing plans to deploy lateral flow tests if signs emerge that avian flu has begun to spread from one person to another. The UK Health Security Agency is also working on blood tests to detect antibodies against the virus and officials will analyze the disease's genetic mutations to reveal data about the increased risk to human health from avian flu. The current bird flu epidemic is caused by the H5N1 strain of virus, which originated in intensive poultry farms in Asia and has since spread round the globe, with infected migrating birds playing a pivotal role in its spread. In Britain, the disease has had a growing impact on wild birds over the past two years with 65 species being infected. Wild Isles will be Attenborough's first time in front of the camera on location since The Green Planet, which was filmed four years ago. The preparation for the series was incredibly demanding, and Attenborough was even accompanied by a doctor with a defibrillator each time he made the climb up the 68 steep concrete steps from the landing jetty to the top of Skomer Island, Radio Times reported. The broadcaster got in shape by repeated trips up and down the 22 stairs that connect the hallway with the study at his home in Richmond, Surrey. In total, the Wild Isles crew filmed in 145 locations and 96 species, which took 1,631 days to film. Other locations Attenborough visited during filming included Old Harry Rocks in Dorset and Richmond Park. Although his family and insiders have said he is not retiring, he is understood to have stopped traveling internationally. Speaking to the Observer, Fothergill said Attenborough agreed to narrate Wild Isles from the start and was later approached about presenting it. \"He felt he had a unique perspective because of his age, on how the British countryside has changed in his lifetime,\" he said. \"He introduces every episode and closes the opening and last episode with very powerful pieces about the fact that, as this is our home, it is our responsibility to try to restore nature.\"", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Last month it was reported that British health officials are preparing plans to deploy lateral flow tests if signs emerge that avian flu has begun to spread from one person to another.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "The UK Health Security Agency is also working on blood tests to detect antibodies against the virus and officials will analyze the disease's genetic mutations to reveal data about the increased risk to human health from avian flu.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "The current bird flu epidemic is caused by the H5N1 strain of virus, which originated in intensive poultry farms in Asia and has since spread round the globe, with infected migrating birds playing a pivotal role in its spread.", "affirm_why_count": 3, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "Two weeks before filming was due to start, reports came in that bird flu had hit the neighboring island of Grassholm, which meant it could also be present on Skomer.", "affirm_keywords_statement_2": "He said, 'Well, bird flu is actually extremely hard to catch, but if he [Attenborough] gets it he will die.'", "affirm_keywords_count": 2, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_statement_1": "He said, 'Well, bird flu is actually extremely hard to catch, but if he [Attenborough] gets it he will die.'", "deny_why_count": 1, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "275", "title": "U.S. Considers Vaccinating Chickens as Bird Flu Kills Millions of Them", "date": "2023-03-06", "fulltext": "The largest outbreak of avian influenza in U.S. history has driven up egg prices and raised concerns about a human pandemic, though C.D.C. experts say the risk of that is low. WASHINGTON — The Biden administration, keeping a watchful eye on an outbreak of avian influenza that has led to the deaths of tens of millions of chickens and is driving up the cost of eggs — not to mention raising the frightening specter of a human pandemic — is contemplating a mass vaccination campaign for poultry, according to White House officials. The bird flu outbreak, which began early last year, is the biggest in the nation's history, affecting more than 58 million farmed birds in 47 states, as well as birds in the wild. It has already spilled over into mammals, such as mink, foxes, raccoons and bears, raising fears that the virus that causes it, known as H5N1, could mutate and start spreading more easily among people. Experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose focus is human health, say the risk of a pandemic is low. As a precaution, the agency has sent drug manufacturers flu virus samples that could form the basis of vaccines for people. The C.D.C. is also exploring whether commercial test manufacturers would be willing to develop tests for H5N1, similar to those used for the coronavirus. Bird flu infections in humans are rare, and transmission of bird flu between humans is extremely rare. Worldwide, there have been nine H5N1 cases reported in people since the beginning of last year, according to the World Health Organization. In Cambodia, an 11-year-old girl recently died from H5N1 and her father was also infected with it, though scientists have not found evidence of human-to-human spread in those cases and the virus was a different version than the one currently circulating in birds in the United States. Cases typically involve people exposed to poultry. In the United States, the C.D.C., in partnership with state and local public health departments, is monitoring people who are exposed to H5N1. As of last week, 6,315 people had been monitored; 163 reported symptoms; and one tested positive, according to Dr. Tim Uyeki, the chief medical officer of the C.D.C.'s influenza division. At the same time, officials at the federal Agriculture Department, which is responsible for the health of farm animals, say they have begun testing potential poultry vaccines and initiated discussions with industry leaders about a large-scale bird flu vaccination program for poultry, which would be a first for the United States. Farm birds are already vaccinated against infectious poultry diseases, such as fowlpox. But an avian influenza vaccination program would be a complex undertaking, and poultry trade associations are divided over the idea, in part because it might spawn trade restrictions that could destroy the $6 billion poultry export industry. Dr. Carol Cardona, an expert on avian health at the University of Minnesota, said that the fear of trade bans was a huge barrier to the mass vaccination of poultry. 'This is the undeclared war — trade,' Dr. Cardona said. White House officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, say that vaccinating poultry is not the only step they are considering. More immediately, they are focused on encouraging poultry farms to prevent transmission of the virus through biosecurity measures like enhanced disinfection procedures for their workers. Avian influenza experts, however, say they believe the administration should move ahead with a vaccination campaign, in part to reduce the risk of a human pandemic. In interviews, several called for the administration to act quickly. 'My own opinion is under the present circumstances, we should be vaccinating the poultry population of the United States against H5N1 — absolutely,' said Robert G. Webster, an expert in avian influenza at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. Such a campaign could 'prevent the inevitable transmission to humans,' he said. For President Biden, there are also political considerations at work. Egg prices, which soared in 2022, were 70 percent higher in January than they were a year earlier. Those high prices have given Republicans another opportunity to attack Mr. Biden over inflation just as he is preparing to run for re-election in 2024. Experts say egg prices could continue rising through the spring, driven in part by Easter season demand but also by supply shortages linked to the bird flu outbreak. And the outbreak may worsen in the months ahead as wild birds begin their spring migrations, bringing the virus with them. The White House officials said they were watching the price fluctuations closely. If a vaccination campaign could provide economic relief for households, Mr. Biden would certainly be interested in such an undertaking, one official said. Experts have long worried that a human-adapted version of bird flu could set off a global pandemic. For that reason, the United States and the world need to be doing more to prepare, said James Krellenstein, an adviser to Global Health Strategies, an international consulting firm. Mr. Krellenstein and Garrett Wilkinson, a health policy expert at the nonprofit Partners in Health, examined the world's readiness for an H5N1 pandemic and identified several 'important gaps,' according to a report they shared with The New York Times. With a two-dose regimen, the United States could need at least 650 million doses of H5N1 vaccine for use in humans, and the report said it was unclear how the country could reach that figure with its current manufacturing capacity. 'While it is extremely important that serious efforts are taken to bring the outbreak in domestic and wild birds under control, the reality of the situation is serious enough that we must be taking more steps to prepare for a possible human outbreak of this virus,' Mr. Krellenstein said in an interview, adding, 'We should be viewing this as a live-action fire drill.' Before Covid-19, many experts predicted that the next pandemic would be caused by influenza. In 2020, the federal Department of Health and Human Services published a 10-year strategy for updating influenza vaccine production; one of the White House officials said the Biden administration was reviewing the document in light of the current outbreak in birds. One step toward pandemic preparedness, many experts agree, would be a poultry vaccination campaign. 'Just having the virus be less widespread would reduce the exposures to humans,' said Anice C. Lowen, an influenza virologist at Emory University, adding that a vaccination effort 'could also reduce the potential for viral evolution that might enable the virus to spread efficiently from person to person.' Currently, federal regulators have not authorized the vaccination of poultry against highly infectious bird flu strains like H5N1, said Mike Stepien, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department. While there are several licensed vaccines, it is unclear whether any of them are effective against the current strain, he said. Scientists at the department have been working to develop vaccine candidates in-house, said Erica Spackman, a research microbiologist at the agency's Agricultural Research Service, who is one of the scientists leading the testing of the poultry vaccines. Dr. Spackman and her colleagues are aiming to test multiple potential vaccines — including those already licensed and the new vaccine candidates — in chickens, turkeys and domestic ducks, she said. If the existing vaccines prove effective, they could potentially be deployed more quickly than new vaccines. Typically, the approval process for animal vaccines can take up to three years, though Mr. Stepien said that time frame could be shortened in an emergency. Dr. Spackman estimated that she and her colleagues would probably not have their first set of results ready to share until May. 'And then there's always the issue on the production side of how quickly the company could actually produce and supply the vaccine,' she added. Beyond the science, there are economic considerations. The United States is one of the world's biggest exporters of poultry products, and its trading partners want assurances that they are not importing meat from infected birds. Vaccination could make it more difficult to prove that birds had not been infected. Broilers — the industry term for chickens raised for their meat — account for the vast bulk of exported poultry, said Amy Hagerman, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University. So it is perhaps not surprising that the National Chicken Council, which represents the broiler industry, opposes vaccination. 'Although initially appealing as a simple solution to a widespread and troublesome problem, vaccination is neither a solution nor simple,' said Tom Super, the council's senior vice president for communications. He said that the broiler industry exported 18 percent of its meat and that losing the ability to export chicken would cost it 'millions and billions of dollars.' But the turkey sector, which has been hit hard by the virus and exports just 9 percent of its meat, is open to vaccination. 'We recognize that unilateral vaccination would have a severe impact on exports,' said Joel Brandenberger, the president of the National Turkey Federation. 'At the same time, we have urged and continue to urge the federal government to move as rapidly as possible to try to develop new agreements with trading partners.' Avian influenza is typically carried by waterfowl and shorebirds, which pass the virus to poultry through their feces or respiratory secretions. During past outbreaks, officials have stamped out the virus by tightening biosecurity measures, quarantining affected farms and culling infected flocks. But with the virus now unusually widespread in wild birds, those steps have failed to contain the spread. A handful of countries in which avian influenza is endemic, including China, Egypt and Vietnam, already routinely vaccinate poultry against it. The vaccines are typically injected into individual birds and require more than one dose, said Dr. Leslie Sims, an international veterinary consultant on the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases who is based in Australia. Although the cost varies, it can be as low as a few cents per dose, he added. Still, even vaccine proponents acknowledge that a mass vaccination campaign would not be a quick endeavor. The United States produces more than nine billion chickens per year for meat alone. It might take a large egg-laying facility, which could contain five million birds, two years to vaccinate enough birds to achieve high levels of population immunity, Dr. Cardona said. Some critics have previously raised concerns that vaccination could reduce the severity of disease in birds without stopping transmission, which might allow the virus to spread through flocks undetected while also spurring the emergence of new, immune-evasive variants. But Richard J. Webby, a bird flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, said there was 'not a lot of evidence for that, at least in a quality vaccination program.' Whatever path the United States takes, Dr. Webby said, the virus is likely to become endemic in wild birds in America. 'This thing,' he said, 'is here to stay.' The outbreak has driven up egg prices, giving Republicans another opportunity to attack President Biden over the rising cost of goods.

Avian flu, also known as H5N1, has spread across multiple species in the country. An initial outbreak among birds was first reported in late November 2022 along the Peruvian coast. SERNANP has now reported at least 63,000 dead birds due to the virus, as well as a rising number of deaths in other species. At least 3,487 sea lions have been found dead due to the virus, according to the agency -- over 3% of Peru's sea lion population. It has also recorded five fur seal deaths linked to the bird flu. \"What we remember initially started with pelicans last year is now affecting these marine mammals,\" Peruvian veterinarian Javier Jara told Reuters. Peruvian authorities are urging citizens to avoid physical contact with wildlife, dead or alive. Avian flu has also infected a record number of birds and some mammals across the United States. Since late 2022, scientists have detected this virus in more than 100 species of wild birds like ducks, seagulls, geese, hawks and owls in the US, where cases have also been identified among bears, foxes, bobcats, raccoons, bears, and dolphins.

{"id": "278", "title": "US focuses on limiting spread amid record bird flu season, but vaccines could be a possibility in the", "date": "2023-03-10", "fulltext": "The Biden administration is monitoring what experts say is the deadliest outbreak of bird flu that the US has ever seen, and officials are considering a range of options on how to respond. The outbreak is not currently considered a serious threat to human health, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, there have only been a handful of cases of avian flu in humans, mostly in people who had direct contact with infected birds or with surfaces contaminated with their excretions. There was one human case last year in the United States, a Colorado man who got sick after culling infected birds. He was isolated and treated with an antiviral. More than 860 total cases of bird flu have been reported among humans in 19 countries since 2003, and more than half of those cases were fatal, according to the CDC. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in February that the risk to humans still remains low. But given the large number of infected birds, he added, we cannot assume that will remain the case. There have been 6,356 cases in wild birds in all 50 states, according to the CDC, but there are probably many more. In 47 states, there have been multiple outbreaks among poultry, involving more than 58.6 million birds. It has also shown up in noncommercial backyard flocks, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The disease has shown up in other animals in the US, too, including bears, foxes, raccoon, possums, mountain lions, bobcats and even a bottlenose dolphin. As the virus moves through mammals, chances go up that it could mutate and spread more easily among humans. The CDC is able to watch for the virus in communities through the labs it uses to monitor more typical flu viruses. The agency also told CNN that it is also exploring whether manufacturers might want to make commercial tests for these viruses more broadly available. The Biden administration said it has also been watching the situation carefully. As a part of the administration's focus on addressing any infectious disease with urgency and preparedness, we continue to monitor the avian flu outbreak. There are a range of options the United States regularly considers when there is any outbreak that could affect the security and safety of the United States' food supply, a National Security Council official told CNN. Right now, we are focused on promoting and enhancing high-impact biosafety practices and procedures. Biosafety procedures typically include enhanced disinfection practices for people who work with birds. In November, the CDC recommended that people who interact with birds that look sick -- even in backyard flocks -- should wear disposable gloves, boots, eye protection and an N95 respirator or a face mask. CDC continues to take any threat of infectious disease seriously and assesses the avian flu's current risk to humans as very low. The Department of Agriculture continues to respond quickly whenever the virus is detected among bird populations, the National Security Council official said. The CDC says the risk assessment tool that it uses to understand a virus' potential as a pandemic risk determined that if these H5N1 viruses were to mutate into a version that could spread easily and efficiently in people, the pandemic risk is moderate, and the public health impact of such an event also would be of moderate severity. This is why it's so important that both the public health and animal health side take precautions to limit exposures among animal species and between animals and people, and thus limit the chances that some type of virus reassortment event that may allow these viruses to infect people easily and spread easily between people, the agency said in an email to CNN. General precautions include containing animal outbreaks and limiting exposure for the public. That includes avoiding close contact with sick birds, cooking poultry fully and not eating raw eggs. Another precaution is to take steps toward a vaccine, just in case, and there are efforts under way. Exploring vaccines for humans and animals Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, and colleagues have been working on a vaccine candidate that could be used in humans if the virus started circulating among people. We think that the vaccine will elicit very high levels of neutralizing antibodies against this specific strain because it's basically perfectly matched to what's circulating now, Hensley said. The vaccine seems to work well in the lab, he said, and the researchers plan to test it on chickens this spring. The CDC says it recently produced a candidate vaccine virus, an influenza virus that manufacturers can use to make a vaccine, that is nearly identical to a viral protein detected in birds and mammals. It could be used to produce a vaccine for people if needed. Such a vaccine would be expected to provide good protections against circulating H5N1 viruses, the CDC said. The agency said it has shared this with vaccine manufacturers. For years, the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, a division of the US Department of Agriculture, has also been working on a vaccine for potential emergency use in animals. There may be an advantage to vaccinating poultry to reduce the chances that the virus could mutate. Vaccinating poultry against avian flu, is not something that's really done in our country, but I think it's time to think about that for sure, Hensley said. Farm animals, including birds, are already vaccinated for other diseases. Chickens, for example, routinely get vaccinated for Marek's disease, which is caused by a herpesvirus. They're also vaccinated against Newcastle disease, a respiratory illness; infectious bronchitis; and acute necrotic proventriculitis, a viral disease that affects the immune system. Avian flu may someday be included in that list, according to a spokesperson for the USDA. In the interest of leaving no stone unturned in the fight against highly pathogenic avian flu, USDA continues to research vaccine options that can protect poultry from this persistent threat, the spokesperson told CNN. Vaccination, though, is not the first option. From vaccine development to production timelines to dissemination to flocks, there are many factors that make implementing a vaccine strategy a challenge, and it would take time to deliver an effective vaccine, the USDA said. So first and foremost, we are pursuing collaborative efforts with poultry farmers and companies on education, training, and implementation of comprehensive biosecurity measures.

{"id": "279", "title": "Scientists Investigate a Bird Flu Outbreak in Seals", "date": "2023-03-15", "fulltext": "Wild birds passed the virus to seals in New England at least twice last summer, a new study suggests. Last summer, the highly contagious strain of avian influenza that had been spreading through North American birds made its way into marine mammals, causing a spike in seal strandings along the coast of Maine. In June and July, more than 150 dead or ailing seals washed ashore. Now, a study provides new insight into the outbreak. Of the 41 stranded seals tested for the virus, nearly half were infected with it, scientists reported on Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. It is likely that wild birds introduced the virus to seals at least twice, the researchers concluded. In several seals, the virus had mutations that are associated with adaptation to mammals. The risk to humans remains low, and the seal outbreak waned quickly, the scientists said. 'It was a dead-end event, as far as we can tell,' said Kaitlin Sawatzki, a postdoctoral researcher at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University and an author of the new paper. 'The virus that entered into those seals has not persisted.' But the report comes amid growing concerns that the virus, which has already caused the largest bird flu outbreak in the nation's history, could adapt to spread more efficiently among mammals, potentially sparking a new pandemic. It remains unclear whether the seals were spreading the virus to one another or primarily picking it up from birds. But the number of affected seals suggests that either the virus spreads easily among the marine mammals or that the barrier for bird-to-seal transmission is low. 'We truly don't know if it's transmitting from bird to seal, bird to seal, bird to seal 100 times over or if it's going into a couple of seals and then spreading,' said Wendy Puryear, a virologist at the Tufts veterinary school and an author of the new paper. 'Both are possible,' she added. 'Neither are great.' Either scenario calls for closer monitoring of seals, said David Stallknecht, an expert on wildlife diseases and influenza at the University of Georgia, who was not involved in the research. 'We need to just keep our eyes on them,' he said. 'The easiest way to tell if this persists in seals is to keep testing them.' The current version of H5N1 has become unusually widespread in wild birds and has spilled over repeatedly into mammals, including bobcats, raccoons and foxes. Scientists believe that most wild mammals are contracting the virus directly from birds. But a bird flu outbreak on a Spanish mink farm last fall suggested that the virus could spread efficiently among some mammalian species. And a mass die-off of sea lions in Peru has raised concerns that marine mammals might be spreading the virus to one another, too. Seals are known to be susceptible to avian influenza, and other versions of the virus have previously caused outbreaks in the animals. The new study is a collaboration between researchers at several academic institutions and wildlife organizations, including Marine Mammals of Maine and New England Wildlife Centers, as well as federal scientists. The researchers collected samples from 1,079 wild birds and 132 gray seals and harbor seals stranded along the North Atlantic coast from Jan. 20 to July 31, 2022. 'That gave us a really powerful ability to see what is happening in the birds and the seals in the same time in the same region,' Dr. Puryear said. There were two waves of flu in wild birds, the researchers found. The first, which peaked in March 2022, primarily affected raptors, while the second, which began in June, hit gulls and sea ducks known as eiders. No seals tested positive for avian influenza during the first wave of bird infections. But during the summer stranding event, 19 of 41 seals tested positive. The researchers found two slightly different versions of the virus in the seals. One matched what was circulating in terns, while the other resembled what was circulating in a broader array of birds, including gulls and eiders. The finding suggests that the virus spilled over at least twice. Because these seals do not typically eat birds, the scientists suspect that the animals are picking up the virus from the environment, perhaps through contact with bird droppings. Viral samples from the seals also had mutations that were rare or absent in birds. Three seal samples had mutations that have been shown to improve viral replication or increase virulence in mammals. Such mutations are not unique. In another recent study, a team of Canadian scientists found the same mutations in some viral samples taken from bird-flu-infected foxes. 'When there's a bird-to-mammalian spillover event, they seem to be acquired pretty quickly,' Dr. Sawatzki said. The presence of these mutations is not, in and of itself, a reason to 'sound the alarm,' Dr. Stallknecht said. But continued surveillance is necessary not only to safeguard human health but also to protect wild animals from a virus that has already proved devastating.

We hope the weekend respite was relaxing and invigorating, because that oh-so familiar routine of phone calls, online meetings, and deadlines has returned.

We hope you have a smashing day and conquer the world. And of course, please do keep in touch. As noted before, postcards and telegrams are always welcome. — Either due to cost or ongoing shortages, people are seeking alternatives to the brand name medications Ozempic and Wegovy, both of which contain the active ingredient semaglutide, NBC News tells us. And some people are turning to compounding pharmacies for the hard-to-get weight-loss drugs. Novo Nordisk, the sole manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy and the patent-holder of semaglutide, said in a statement that it does not provide the ingredient to these pharmacies, leading some experts to question where pharmacies are sourcing the drug and whether it is semaglutide at all. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics two months ago released its first formal clinical practice guidelines centered on the screening and treatment of young patients with obesity, there is still no consensus on how best to approach obesity in children, STAT explains. While some praised the guidelines, others complain there is a focus on weight instead of health, a lack of clarity or directness about who the recommendations are for, too little input from various subspecialists, a reliance on mediocre or limited data, and a downplaying of the long-term implications of drug treatment and surgery. Some of the world’s leading makers of flu vaccines say they could make hundreds of millions of bird flu shots for humans within months if a new strain of avian influenza ever jumps across the species divide, according to Reuters. One current outbreak of avian flu known as H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has killed record numbers of birds and infected mammals. Human cases, however, remain very rare, and global health officials have said the risk of transmission between humans is still low. GSK, Moderna, and CSL Seqirus say they are already developing or about to test sample human vaccines that better match the circulating subtype, as a precautionary measure against a future pandemic. The state of California and a nonprofit generic drug manufacturer announced a 10-year partnership to produce affordable, state-branded insulin that they hope will rival longtime producers and push down prices for a medication used by millions of Americans, the Associated Press writes. The product is not expected on store shelves until at least next year, and it is difficult to predict what effect it would have on a market already shaken by change. Earlier this month, three major insulin makers promised steep price cuts. Meanwhile, the state and its partner, Civica, have yet to locate a manufacturing facility based in California. And regulatory approvals will be needed. Three years into the pandemic, a program backed by the United Nations to build a network of self-reliant research and manufacturing sites for mRNA vaccines is struggling, The Washington Post explains. The program is seeking a large increase in funds to ensure its sustainability, its backers say, raising concerns about the long-term future of the effort. The U.S. has yet to respond to a funding request for $100 million, sent late last year by the backers of the program, which is being organized primarily by the Medicines Patent Pool, a U.N.-supported public health organization. The support would about double its funding overall. Moderna chief executive officer Stéphane Bancel is starting to reap gargantuan gains from the stock he first got when he started with the company a decade ago, although nearly all of this chunk of his fortune remains earmarked for unknown charities, STAT reports. Bancel made $398 million in 2022 based on the actual realized gains of stock that was exercised and sold, according to STAT calculations from Moderna’s annual compensation disclosure filed last week. The more commonly reported compensation figure, $19.4 million, is less accurate and does not factor in the value Bancel actually received from his stock. A decade into the era of the HIV prevention pill, called PrEP, efforts to leverage its heralded power to curb new infections have stagnated in the U.S., NBC News tells us. This shortfall is a key reason the nation lags far behind many others in combating HIV, with a national epidemic long plagued by racial inequities and only a modestly declining rate of new infections. On the bright side, PrEP, which is short for pre-exposure prophylaxis and involves taking either oral or injectable prescription antiretroviral medications in advance of potential HIV exposure, has indeed achieved substantial popularity but only among white gay and bisexual men, who have long seen a dropping HIV rate. Karuna Therapeutics disclosed that its treatment for schizophrenia reduced psychosis reported by patients achieving the main goal of a large clinical trial and supporting similarly positive results from previously conducted studies, STAT writes. The company intends to file a marketing application for its drug, called KarXT, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the middle of the year. If approved, the Karuna drug would usher in the first new class of medicines for the treatment of schizophrenia in decades. In the Phase 3 study, KarXT taken twice per day reduced schizophrenia symptoms by 20.6 points compared with a placebo decrease of 12.2 points. Torrent Pharmaceuticals was cited by the FDA for manufacturing violations at a plant in India, according to a notice filed with the Bombay Stock Exchange. The agency issued a so-called 483 report following a recent pre-approval inspection at an oral oncology facility in Bileshwarpura, Gujarat. The company maintained the FDA found just one issue that was “procedural in nature.” Last September, the FDA issued a 483 report to a different Torrent facility in Indrad, Gujurat, after agency inspectors found possible contamination and improper investigations into lab failures.", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "Some of the world’s leading makers of flu vaccines say they could make hundreds of millions of bird flu shots for humans within months if a new strain of avian influenza ever jumps across the species divide, according to Reuters.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "One current outbreak of avian flu known as H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has killed record numbers of birds and infected mammals.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Human cases, however, remain very rare, and global health officials have said the risk of transmission between humans is still low.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "GSK, Moderna, and CSL Seqirus say they are already developing or about to test sample human vaccines that better match the circulating subtype, as a precautionary measure against a future pandemic.", "affirm_why_count": 3, "affirm_keywords_statement_3": "Three years into the pandemic, a program backed by the United Nations to build a network of self-reliant research and manufacturing sites for mRNA vaccines is struggling, The Washington Post explains.", "affirm_keywords_count": 1, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_statement_1": "Human cases, however, remain very rare, and global health officials have said the risk of transmission between humans is still low.", "deny_why_count": 1, "deny_keywords_statement_1": "Some of the world’s leading makers of flu vaccines say they could make hundreds of millions of bird flu shots for humans within months if a new strain of avian influenza ever jumps across the species divide, according to Reuters.

{"id": "281", "title": "First birds, now mammals: how H5N1 is killing thousands of sea lions in Peru", "date": "2023-03-21", "fulltext": "Avian flu has decimated the marine creatures on the country's Pacific coastline and scientists fear it could be jumping from mammal to mammal. At first, it appears to be dead. Its head lies in the sand, and a small tide pool has formed around it. Its shoulder blades jut out and its coffee and beige pelt hangs loosely on protruding vertebrae that taper down to its long tail flippers. But the young male sea lion is still alive. Its round wet eyes blink and occasionally it tries to move, rolling over or lifting its head, as the flooding tide inches it up the beach in Chepeconde, about 75 miles south of Peru's coastal capital, Lima. \"Looking at the state he's in, you can see that his ribs are showing, this sea lion may have been like this for 10 days, perhaps up to half a month,\" says Pilar Ayala, a biologist with Peru's wildlife service Serfor, dressed in face mask and white hazmat suit. \"He has not been able to get food. This, added to the weakness from the disease, has caused his condition to worsen and he can no longer even move around. He's stranded on this beach,\" says Ayala, part of a team of wildlife specialists who have been spending their days registering and taking samples from dead and dying animals along Peru's 1,850-mile Pacific coastline. The young male has all the symptoms of the H5N1 variant of avian influenza which is ravaging the country's population of about 105,000 South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens). This month, Peru's national parks service, Sernanp, recorded the deaths of 3,487 sea lions, 3.29% of the total number, as well as five far less common fur seals (Arctocephalus australis), in seven protected areas along the coast. But scientists estimate the true number of bird flu deaths is probably much higher. Approaching the Isla San Gallán by boat—a two-hour trip from the Paracas national reserve—you can hear the colony of sea lions before it is possible to make out the individuals in the dark brown mass lining the strand. A cacophony of roaring and bleating; from the huge maned bulls, each guarding a harem of females, to the pups calling out for their mothers among the fiercely territorial family groups. Curious juveniles swim out in groups to investigate our boat, raising their long necks out of the water before disappearing in a splash. On closer inspection, there are several corpses being fed on by turkey vultures and gulls. While deaths are normal in large colonies and not necessarily a sign of disease, a drone flight confirmed the presence of dozens more corpses littering the beach. In the overcrowded colony, mixed with seabirds, it is easy to see the potential for infectious disease to spread. The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype A, the (HPAI) H5N1 variant, was first detected in Peruvian pelicans on the northern coast in November but soon spread south, killing Peruvian boobies, sanderlings and Guanay cormorants. Sernanp has counted at least 63,000 dead sea birds in national parks and protected guano islands, many more can be seen strewn along the country's coastline, home to one of the world's richest fisheries. Infected birds wobble along public beaches unafraid of the crowds of beachgoers enjoying the summer sunshine. \"The fact that the virus is not only in birds but also in mammals means it is potentially risky for the public,\" says Ayala. \"It is currently being seen in different species of mammals, so we must take precautions in order to avoid another pandemic for humans.\" About 100 metres from the dying sea lion, Ayala finds the corpse of an endangered marine otter (lontra felina). Cases of avian flu in otters, foxes and seals have been recorded in other countries, including the UK. \"If the sample from this otter is positive, it would be the first case of influenza in this species [in Peru],\" she says. Later, test results prove inconclusive because the animal has been dead for too long. The mass die-off of sea lions suggests that there might be mammal-to-mammal transmission, though we cannot confirm that. While the virus has mainly infected sea lions, a dead dolphin has also tested positive, and, in February, a lion died from the virus in a zoo in Huancayo, a city in the Andes. Just weeks later, Peru's agricultural health service, Senasa, announced a health emergency until the end of the year; prohibiting the unauthorized movement of live poultry, and banning cockfights. Scientists are worried not just that the virus has jumped from birds to mammals but that mammal-to-mammal transmission might be a possibility. \"The mass die-off of sea lions suggests that there might be mammal-to-mammal transmission, though we cannot confirm that,\" says Mariana Leguia, who runs the Genomics Laboratory at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in Lima, which has been analyzing samples gathered along the country's coast since November. \"Obviously, that is concerning because this is a virus with pathogenic potential for humans.\" In February, the World Health Organization warned of a possible bird flu pandemic after the past year and a half constituted the world's deadliest outbreak of the disease in domestic and wild birds. Leguia and her team raced to publish a scientific paper listing the genome sequences of tested bird flu samples. The virus has spread to 15 countries in the Americas but Peru has seen the biggest mortality in mammals. As the virus tears through Peru's coastal species, conservationists worry about the impact on endangered marine otters and threatened Humboldt penguins and Andean condors, the last of which scavenge dead sea lions. Peru's biodiversity as well as its geography—sitting squarely in the middle of South America—make it vulnerable and also a potential threat as migratory birds that bring the virus from the north fly back northward again, possibly carrying a mutated variant. \"There is the possibility of a massive number of different species acquiring the virus and it mutating in the process,\" warns Leguia.

{"id": "283", "title": "Farne Islands shut to visitors over fears of new avian flu outbreak", "date": "2023-03-31", "fulltext": "Rangers work to avoid repeat of last year's devastating losses in breeding seabird colonies on the islands off the Northumberland coast The Farne Islands will not open to visitors this spring in anticipation of bird flu once again ravaging breeding seabird colonies, after an unprecedented spate of deaths last year. The rocky outcrop of islands off the coast of Northumberland has been looked after by the National Trust since 1925 and there are no previous records of so many endangered seabirds dying at once. More than 6,000 carcasses were picked up last year, which is believed to be the tip of the iceberg compared with how many birds would have died in total. Guillemots were worst affected, with more than 3,500 carcasses collected, followed by more than 800 kittiwakes. Rangers are particularly concerned about the small but vulnerable population of sandwich terns. There are an estimated 330 pairs nesting, and last year the bodies of about 300 adults and chicks were collected. 'We suspect bird flu is going to hit us in a similar way to how it did last year,' said Harriet Reid, lead ranger for the Farne Islands, which are a National Nature Reserve on account of their remarkable seabird colonies. 'Many of the species we care for are rare and struggling already due to climate change. Therefore, we want to try to mitigate the impact of this disease by limiting human access, and limiting disturbance,' she said. The National Trust islands are home to about 200,000 seabirds, including puffins, arctic terns, razorbills and shags. Most will come back to the islands in May and June. There have been some dead gulls and eider ducks on the island within the small overwintering population, although it has not been confirmed if they died of bird flu. For Inner Farne, the season typically runs from 1 April until the end of September, and for Staple Island it starts in May and finishes at the end of July. About 45,000 visitors land on the islands each year. Visitors will still be able to do tours around the islands and there is a chance they could open for visitors later in the season, the National Trust said. 'I can't see any other virus, issue or stormy weather that has ever hit the islands like this. The prospect of picking up 6,000 carcasses again is not great,' said Reid. 'It's never nice to think about bird flu and picking up dead birds. But I feel better about going into it this year because we know what it looks like, we know what is required to pick up bodies, and we've had more time to plan. Part of the islands being restricted for landings makes it easier for us to carry out that management.' In the UK, the effects of avian flu started to be felt in the northernmost islands of Scotland in spring 2022, spreading the length of the country, with colonies of nesting seabirds the worst hit. Colonies across Europe, North and South America, and Asia have all been badly hit, with an unknown number of wild birds believed to have been killed. It is the worst avian flu outbreak recorded across Europe and America. Rangers are hoping to create the best nesting habitat possible on the island and will be monitoring species to see how many return after last year's outbreak. Ben McCarthy, head of nature conservation and restoration ecology at the National Trust, said: 'The recent impact of avian influenza on our wild birds is unprecedented. As threatened seabirds return to their breeding sites they become more susceptible to infection due to the high densities in these spectacular colonies. We are actively participating in international research efforts to understand the long-term impacts of this pernicious disease and are doing everything we can to mitigate the impact on the Farne Islands and our other seabird sites.' The National Trust is not planning to close any other reserves as a result of avian influenza. The RSPB, NatureScot and the Wildlife Trusts do not currently have any closures planned either. The public should not touch dead or dying birds, and should report suspected bird flu cases to Defra on 03459 33 55 77.

(AP) — Bird flu has returned to Minnesota less than four months after the deadly poultry disease was last detected in the state, the Board of Animal Health said Monday. The detection was confirmed in a backyard mixed flock in Le Sueur County of south-central Minnesota, the board said. The site was quarantined and the 114 birds on the premises — mostly chickens — were destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease. Minnesota's last previous detection was in a backyard flock in Redwood County of southwestern Minnesota in December. “We were fortunate to get a reprieve from the virus during the past few months,” Dr. Shauna Voss, the board's senior poultry veterinarian, said in a statement. “We've been anticipating the return of the virus and are recalling our partner resources back to the fight. We continue to call on anyone who owns birds to stand up their biosecurity, especially during these next couple months.” The outbreak began last year, driving up egg and poultry prices, and forcing the slaughter of more than 58 million birds across the country to limit the spread of the virus. With the outbreak entering its second year, and the spring migratory season for wild birds looming, there is no end in sight.

Japanese state broadcaster NHK reported Tuesday that 16 out of 26 prefectures in the country did not have enough land to dispose of culled birds properly. All 26 had reported experiencing avian flu outbreaks recently. While local authorities and farms usually kill and bury the animals to prevent further spread of the virus, the land shortage has now held back those efforts, according to NHK. Japan has been grappling with a record outbreak of avian flu in recent months, putting strain on the supply of poultry and sending the price of eggs soaring. More than 17 million chickens have been culled this season, the highest number on record, NHK reported Tuesday. Japan previously slaughtered nearly 9.9 million in fiscal 2020 over another bird flu crisis, its last record high. In a report this month, Rabobank said global egg prices had reached historic high levels in the first quarter of 2023, citing the impact of avian flu across countries and higher feed costs for hens. Between mid-2020 and mid-2022, global feed prices have doubled, largely due to fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it said. Now, prices globally are 2.5 times higher than the reference year of 2007, and have increased more than 100% since this time last year, wrote Nan-Dirk Mulder, Rabobank's senior analyst of animal protein. The situation has spurred some people around the world to buy their own hens to secure their own supplies of the pantry staple. In Japan, egg prices reached a 10-year high of 235 yen ($1.8) last month, according to Rabobank. Prices in many other markets have reached historic highs as well, including in Thailand, the Philippines, Israel, New Zealand, Nigeria, Kenya, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, it said. The situation isn't expected to improve much this year. While countries such as Japan and the United States may have already experienced price peaks, we expect prices to stay relatively high throughout 2023, especially in markets heavily impacted by avian flu, high costs, and regulatory changes, Mulder wrote. In other markets there will be some drop in prices, but not to pre-2021 levels, as lingering high input costs are keeping prices higher.

{"id": "287", "title": "Bird Flu Is Surging. Dialing Back Its Pandemic Risk Starts with Prevention", "date": "2023-04-06", "fulltext": "The last two years have witnessed an unprecedented global expansion of avian influenza. Moving along migratory bird flyways into Europe and the Americas, a new strain of H5N1 influenza has established itself in wild birds and domestic poultry, leading to a record 58.6 million birds culled in the U.S. and new outbreaks across Latin America and the Caribbean. This strain's spread in birds, along with infections of mammals and sporadic human cases—one fatal—raises pandemic influenza concerns. Last October the virus was likely transmitting between farmed mink in Spain and may have spread among sea lions during a mass mortality event in Peru earlier this year. Influenza is highly mutable and prone to dramatic genetic shifts, challenging any prediction of which viral subtype could emerge as a future pandemic. But each such event is another warning of viral churn, the portrait of a mutating pathogen that could yield a virus capable of infecting and transmitting among humans. This is a numbers game—a game we are losing. We must seize the opportunity to invest in prevention and fill gaps in global detection and response to avert an influenza pandemic. But what do we have to do better? Pandemics are a byproduct of how humans live on this planet: intimately connected across aggressively altered landscapes as we seek to house and feed over eight billion people. Influenza is no exception. Soaring demand for meat and eggs is shifting animal production and land use patterns, driving animals and humans into ever greater contact and escalating pandemic risk. Yet dialing back pandemic influenza risk is within our reach. Immediately, we must redouble upstream prevention, mitigating risk where the virus circulates in wild and domestic animals. On farms, restricting entry, limiting vehicle and equipment movement and implementing strict worker disinfection protocols will boost biosecurity. Checklists can be useful to systematically fill biosecurity gaps. Limiting domestic animal contact with wild birds—particularly at shared water sources—is essential. In England, a mandatory order for all poultry holders to house their flocks indoors is reducing domestic poultry exposure. Early warning surveillance and bird migration patterns can help target housing orders to times of peak risk. Market-based live poultry sales, common globally, also carry risk. Livelihoods depend on these markets. But we can make them safer. Separating highest-risk activities, such as on-site slaughter, defeathering and processing away from points of sale may help reduce viral exposure. These protocols should be augmented with regular cleaning and disinfection, market rest days, avoidance of species mixing, and bans on overnight poultry holding—all proven to reduce circulating virus. Strategically vaccinating poultry, while carrying trade-restriction implications for poultry-exporting nations, can also substantially reduce circulating virus when other containment measures fail. When Guangdong province in China began mass poultry vaccination with an H7 vaccine in 2017, zoonotic influenza A/H7N9 human cases dropped 98 percent within a year. Together, these upstream measures minimize human exposure and interrupt viral exchange between wild birds, domestic poultry and other animals. To successfully implement these measures, farmers and businesses along the chain of production from farm to fork can't exclusively shoulder the costs; instead, these interventions should be viewed as investments in protecting public health. The newly launched Pandemic Fund can play an important role in building out the animal health capacities required for safe, secure, sustainable animal production and disease prevention. The investment case is clear: spend modestly on prevention now, or pay catastrophic health and social disruption costs later. The price tag for such a global prevention architecture? $11.5 billion annually. By contrast, in 2020 the global economy contracted 3.1 percent due to COVID—more than $2.7 trillion—with continued economic scarring projected through 2023. Our best, and most cost-effective, approach to averting the next pandemic is to reduce the viral exposure and spillover that spark outbreaks. However, we should not rely upon prevention alone to counter pandemic influenza. We must also fine-tune our surveillance structures to pick up signals from influenza viruses displaying worrisome mutations in both traditional and unexpected locations where animals and humans mix, risking spillover. These structures should see around corners, tracking the virus in new animal hosts to inform risk assessments. And we must dramatically extend their reach. Frontline health care workers globally should stay alert to unusual patterns of respiratory illness, prepared to quickly identify and arrest the earliest human-to-human clusters should they emerge. COVID broadened existing capabilities to identify human acute respiratory infections. We should leverage them. Influenza is not the only viral threat of this pandemic era, and as we suggested in 2017, these syndromic surveillance platforms should also detect a broad array of both known and as-yet-unknown respiratory viruses. Critically, we should expand stockpiles of prepandemic influenza vaccine, reserves meant to buy time until a well-matched shot can be produced. We need to produce, preauthorize and predeploy these vaccines equitably worldwide. Prepositioned vaccines, antivirals, personal protective equipment and rapid tests could save precious weeks and months in an escalating epidemic, breaking transmission chains, averting a pandemic and saving lives. Finally, hoping that history does not repeat itself should not be our pandemic influenza contingency plan. Engaging community leaders in scenario planning should start now. And we must learn from COVID and engineer messaging campaigns that unite the global community around a shared vision—preventing the next pandemic. Reassuringly, there is progress: Heightened surveillance alerts have been issued. Surge capacity planning tools are available. Prepandemic influenza vaccine virus, based on the new clade 2.3.4.4b strain, has been proposed. And paradigm-shifting, palm-sized genetic sequencing platforms now bring the lab into the field; these devices turn samples into full viral genome sequences in less than a day, making them available immediately on genetic repositories. Air samplers placed in live animal markets and other high-risk, high-contact locations paired with these field diagnostics bring us closer to near-real-time influenza monitoring. Migratory birds will soon move north to summer breeding grounds, carrying with them the prospect of a fresh set of viral incursions. Yes, influenza is churning, but we can expand these strategies to keep us ahead of the next outbreak. The off-ramp from the pandemic era is well-marked. The choice before us is whether we take it.

(AP) — Three California condors have died from avian flu in northern Arizona and authorities are trying to determine what killed five others in the flock, the National Park Service announced Friday. A sick female condor suspected of having lead poisoning was found dead on March 20 and testing showed it had Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), the park service said. Two other birds later found dead also tested positive, while test results aren't yet completed for five others, the park service said. The birds are part of a population that moves throughout northern Arizona and southern Utah, including Grand Canyon National Park, the park service said. The Peregrine Fund, which manages the Arizona-Utah flock, also captured five other birds that seemed ill and sent them to a wildlife rescue in Phoenix. One bird died and the other four have been quarantined, officials said. Exposure to the virus is expected to rise during the condors' northward spring migration. HPAI hasn't been detected in other populations in California or Mexico's Baja California, according to the park service. Avian flu occurs mainly in birds including domestic chickens, but it has been found in other animals, wild and domestic, in all U.S. states except Hawaii. Humans are considered to be at low risk from HPAI, although there have been reported infections. The California condor is one of the world's largest birds with a wingspan of up to 10 feet (3 meters). The birds once patrolled the sky from Mexico to British Columbia. Condors can live for 60 years and fly vast distances, which is why their range can extend into several states. The population plummeted to the brink of extinction in the 1970s because of hunting, habitat destruction and lead poisoning from animals eating shot with lead bullets. In the 1980s, wildlife officials captured the last remaining 22 condors and took them to the San Diego and Los Angeles zoos to be protected and bred in captivity. The birds were then released into sanctuaries and national parks where they can be monitored. The birds have been protected as an endangered species by federal law since 1967 and by California state law since 1971. California condors have been making a comeback in the wild and now occupy parts of California's Central Coast, Arizona, Utah and Baja California, Mexico.

{"id": "289", "title": "At Least 3 California Condors Die From Bird Flu in Arizona", "date": "2023-04-09", "fulltext": "Exposure to the virus is expected to rise as condors, an endangered species, migrate north in the spring, the National Park Service said. At least three California condors in northern Arizona have died since last month from bird flu, which could spread and pose yet another threat to the endangered species, the National Park Service said. Officials are trying to determine whether the virus was the cause of death for five other condors. Five additional birds that were captured exhibited signs of the illness, the Park Service said. The condor — scavenger bird with a 9-foot wingspan — is an endangered species that has been protected by federal law since 1967 and by California state law since 1971. Wildlife officials with the Peregrine Fund, which manages the Arizona-Utah condor flock, collected a dead female condor on March 20 that they first believed was sickened by lead poisoning. A positive result for highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory on March 30. Officials later confirmed that two other condors had died from the illness, a subtype of the flu. The Peregrine Fund captured five additional birds that showed symptoms of illness and sent them to a wildlife rescue in Phoenix. One bird died shortly upon arrival. Its cause of death was not immediately clear on Sunday. Four others have been quarantined as they are tested, the Park Service said. Test results were not yet final for five additional dead birds. Signs of the illness in birds include lethargy, lack of coordination, holding the head in an unusual position and walking in circles, according to the Park Service, which said the highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in every state except Hawaii. The California condor is the largest land bird in North America, native to large sections of the continent, from California to Florida and Western Canada to Northern Mexico. By 1982, only 23 condors remained in the wild, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Scientists believe that the species has been threatened by habitat degradation, lead poisoning from lead ammunition, and the synthetic insecticide DDT, which was banned in the United States in 1972. To prevent extinction, scientists captured the remaining birds in 1987 to breed in zoos. The birds were later reintroduced to the wild in sanctuaries and national parks. By 2020, the population had grown to 504 birds. The infected birds were part of a population that moves between northern Arizona and southern Utah, including Grand Canyon National Park, according to the Park Service. Officials expect exposure to the virus to rise during the condors' migration north in the spring. So far, the avian flu has not been detected in other condors in California or Mexico's Baja California, the Park Service said.

{"id": "291", "title": "Lab-created bird flu virus accident shows lax oversight of risky 'gain of function' research", "date": "2023-04-11", "fulltext": "This exclusive article is adapted from former USA TODAY investigative reporter Alison Young's forthcoming book 'Pandora's Gamble: Lab Leaks, Pandemics, and a World at Risk,' which will be released April 25. In this excerpt, Young reveals for the first time details of a December 2019 lab safety breach involving one of the world's most infamous lab-created 'gain of function' viruses and the efforts that were made to downplay the event, avoid notifying health authorities and oversight bodies, and keep the public and policymakers in the dark. Inside the high-security Influenza Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, two experienced scientists were pulling ferrets out of their HEPA-filtered cages on a Monday in December 2019. Another researcher, still in training, was also in the room to watch and learn. One by one, the animals were put into a biosafety cabinet, where a solution was washed into their nostrils. It's a procedure used to collect evidence of infection, and this particular experiment involved exposing the animals to a highly controversial lab-engineered strain of H5N1 avian influenza virus. The virus they were working with that day was far from ordinary, and there should have been no room for the safety breach that was about to happen and the oversight failures that followed. The experiment underway involved one of two infamous lab-made bird flu viruses that had alarmed scientists around the world when their creation became widely known nearly a decade earlier. In each case, scientists had taken an avian influenza virus that was mostly dangerous to birds and manipulated it in ways that potentially increased its threat to humans. In nature, the H5N1 virus has rarely infected humans. But when people have been sickened, usually through close contact with infected birds, more than half died. So it is fortunate that the H5N1 virus isn't capable of spreading easily from person to person. If the virus were ever to evolve in ways that gave it that ability, it could cause a devastating pandemic. 'Gain of function' research created controversial flu viruses And yet in late 2011 the world learned that two scientific teams one in Wisconsin, led by virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka, and another in the Netherlands, led by virologist Ron Fouchier had potentially pushed the virus in that direction. Each of these labs had created H5N1 viruses that had gained the ability to spread through the air between ferrets, the animal model used to study how flu viruses might behave in humans. The ultimate goal of this work was to help protect the world from future pandemics, and the research was supported with words and funding by two of the most prominent scientists in the United States: Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Kawaoka contended it would be irresponsible not to study how the virus might evolve in nature. Some people have argued that the risks of such studies misuse and accidental release, for example outweigh the benefits. I counter that H5N1 viruses circulating in nature already pose a threat, he said at the time. Yet these groundbreaking scientific feats set off a heated international debate over the ethics and safety of 'gain of function' research. The controversy continues to this day. Concerns about the safety of biological research have taken on heightened urgency in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and growing acceptance of the possibility that it was caused by a lab accident in China. In February, it was revealed that analysts at the U.S. Department of Energy had joined the FBI in leaning toward a lab accident as the most likely source of the pandemic, though other U.S. intelligence agencies lean toward a natural origin or are undecided. Where's the apology?: COVID may have leaked out of a Chinese lab after all. So much for 'misinformation.' Former U.S. surgeon general: We'll never know the full truth about COVID-19 origins. Political infighting won't help. The story of how the H5N1 viruses came to be created and how the University of Wisconsin and the Kawaoka lab would later respond to the 2019 safety breach during the ferret experiment raises uncomfortable questions about the tremendous trust the world places in these kinds of labs. We are trusting that every hour of every day their layers of laboratory containment equipment are working properly, that all of their employees are sufficiently trained, qualified and attentive, and that their written safety and incident response protocols are followed in real-life practice. When something goes wrong, we are trusting that the labs will immediately notify local public health officials who are responsible for preventing outbreaks and the federal authorities who oversee the safety of experiments with genetically engineered organisms. Given that so much about this work is shrouded in secrecy, what happened in Wisconsin raises the question: Should the public give this trust blindly? 'Miscommunication' over quarantine alarmed NIH a decade ago In 2013, six years before the 2019 safety incident with the ferret experiment at Kawaoka's lab in Wisconsin, another member of his research team accidentally pierced their finger with a needle that had an engineered H5N1 virus on it. It was a moment of poor judgment, human error around 6:30 p.m. Nov. 16, 2013, that set off a series of emergency calls that would eventually raise concerns in the nation's capital. An expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told officials at Wisconsin's state health department that while the likelihood the scientist would develop symptoms of H5N1 was low, the needlestick should be considered a serious exposure and treated aggressively. The chief medical officer at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services told the university that the researcher would need to quarantine for seven days and take a treatment-level dose of Tamiflu twice a day for 10 days. Six months earlier, while seeking funding and approval for the controversial experiments, Kawaoka had assured officials at the National Institutes of Health that the university had a designated quarantine apartment. But it turned out that wasn't the case. So lab officials told the researcher's family to pack up their belongings and go to a hotel. And the injured researcher was sent to quarantine at home. Officials in the NIH office responsible for overseeing research with engineered organisms were alarmed to learn that the university didn't have a dedicated quarantine facility for such emergencies. This policy is not what was communicated to us in Dr. Kawaoka's application to perform research with mammalian transmissible strains of H5N1, wrote Dr. Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, acting director of the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, in a letter to the university. A researcher's home, the NIH told the university, was not an appropriate quarantine site for Kawaoka's high-risk studies because influenza viruses can be transmissible through the air, and many residences are in high-occupancy buildings, like apartments, that share air exchange and other infrastructure. Trying to provide an explanation, university officials told NIH there had been a miscommunication between Kawaoka and the university's administration. Wisconsin officials noted that the needlestick was not expected to put the researcher at high risk of infection, and that this engineered virus was determined not to be a mammalian-transmissible strain. The scientist with the needlestick completed quarantine without showing symptoms or becoming ill. But even if a high-risk incident occurred with a more dangerous strain, UW officials told the NIH, the lab worker would still be quarantined at home. Could an accident have caused COVID-19?: Why the Wuhan lab-leak theory shouldn't be dismissed 'I remember it very well': Dr. Fauci describes a secret 2020 meeting to talk about COVID origins It was a stunning change by the university to a critical safeguard that federal officials thought was in place for the Kawaoka lab's research. The NIH demanded the university find a dedicated quarantine facility outside of workers' residences, such as a hospital isolation room, or face the suspension or termination of its grant funding, correspondence shows. The university didn't want to use the UW Hospital as a quarantine site. Their concerns included that researchers might be unwilling to come forward about potential exposures if they faced being confined in hospital isolation rooms. The university and its medical team also worried about the increased potential for the public to learn about its lab accidents, noting in correspondence that it would be much harder to control the spread of information and as a result there would be a higher probability of incorrect information being told to (the) general public and potentially members of the media. The university eventually agreed to NIH's demands. And on Dec. 24, 2013, the NIH gave its approval for Kawaoka's lab to resume its research manipulating H5N1 virus strains that were transmissible to mammals. Safety concerns led to US pause on 'gain of function' studies By 2014, there was a growing discomfort at the highest levels of the U.S. government about the risk of an accident with an engineered virus. Wisconsin's needlestick incident, which drew questions within NIH but wasn't publicly known, was soon followed by a series of high-profile accidents at federal labs in 2014 from safety breaches with anthrax and avian influenza at the CDC to the discovery of forgotten vials of smallpox that had been kept for decades in a storage room on the NIH campus. In October 2014, citing these federal lab incidents, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced a moratorium on new federal funding for certain gain-of-function research while the risks and benefits of the controversial experiments were studied. The funding pause remained in place for three years until it was finally lifted in December 2017. But it was only in 2019 that some of the halted experiments were quietly allowed to begin again under a revised federal oversight process, which was criticized for keeping secret the details of the new experiments and the basis for the government approvals. The Kawaoka lab was one of the first to receive approval and NIH funding. Not long after the Kawaoka lab was greenlighted in 2019 to resume work with its infamous lab-created H5N1 influenza virus the one that had helped spark the worldwide debate over gain-of-function research there was an accident. And in the days and weeks that followed, efforts were made to downplay the significance of the event, avoid notifying public health officials and oversight bodies, and keep the public and policymakers in the dark. A lot was at stake. Not only would the incident draw attention to safety issues at the UW lab, but it also would raise larger questions about the rigor and effectiveness of how the U.S. government was overseeing the riskiest experiments in which scientists are creating enhanced pathogens with pandemic potential. Scientist's air hose detached in lab while working with engineered virus When the accident happened on Dec. 9, 2019, Kawaoka's three scientists were working in an enhanced biosafety level 3 agriculture lab suite at the University of Wisconsin's Influenza Research Institute. This facility had been built specifically for Kawaoka's research and featured labs with negative air pressure, watertight and airtight seals, double HEPA-filtered exhaust air and redundant air handling systems. The experiment they were performing involved a virus whose name describes the components of its engineering: VN1203HA(N158D/N224K/ Q226L/T318I)/CA04. It was the virus described in Kawaoka's controversial H5N1 gain-of-function experiments that had been published nearly eight years earlier, the NIH would later confirm in written responses to my questions. It was the virus that had gained the concerning ability to spread between ferrets and had raised fears it could do this among humans. On that December day, two experienced researchers from Kawaoka's team were helping train a colleague as they collected samples from ferrets. The animals were part of a transmission experiment and had been in contact with other ferrets infected with this engineered H5N1 virus or another wild-type flu strain. The three scientists wore several layers of personal protection equipment. One of their most important pieces of personal protective equipment was the air-purifying respirator that each wore to ensure they didn't breathe any air from inside the laboratory. Even though they were using a biosafety cabinet, there was always the potential for virus to be present in the room's air. These kinds of high-tech respirators encase workers' heads in a protective hood with a clear face-plate. A blower attached to a belt delivers purified air through what looks like a vacuum cleaner hose that runs up the scientist's back and attaches to the hood behind their head. Labs are responsible for training workers how to properly assemble and use this kind of equipment. As one of the senior researchers prepared to start collecting samples from the next round of ferrets, the trainee realized there was a problem with their respirator. The powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) hose had somehow disconnected from the unit that supplied safe, filtered air. Instead, the detached hose dangled loose in the lab's potentially contaminated air. The hose was immediately reconnected, Wisconsin officials later said, and one of the experienced researchers radioed out to the lab's operations manager as the trainee began the process of exiting the lab, incident records show. The trainee was initially told to follow the lab's quarantine procedure to keep them spreading the virus if they were infected. The university would later say this was done out of an abundance of caution. But at some point, a lab compliance official released the worker from quarantine. It is unclear whether this quarantine release happened within minutes, hours or days of the incident. Nor is it clear whether university officials first consulted with any public health and oversight agencies. Kawaoka and university officials wouldn't agree to be interviewed and provided little information in response to my questions. State and local health officials weren't notified about lab accident If there were ever a virus requiring that everyone follow safety and incident reporting rules, this was it. The system of oversight in place that day had been created in response to the international furor over this very virus. Yet, after the trainee's respirator hose disconnected in December 2019, the university didn't notify local or state public health officials about the incident or consult with them before discontinuing the trainee's quarantine, despite representations going back years indicating this would occur following any potential exposure. The university says it didn't need to notify them. That's because UW officials, in consultation with the university's health experts, made their own determination that no potential exposure had occurred. Officials at Public Health Madison & Dane County, the local health department, told me they defer to the university's judgment and expertise when it comes to lab safety issues. The department said it does not need to be notified of something that was determined to not be a significant exposure. It is also not incumbent on us to further evaluate whether there was a significant exposure, if UW reports that there was not. The university also didn't immediately alert other key oversight entities that the public relies upon to ensure the safety of this kind of particularly risky research. UW officials waited two months until Feb. 10, 2020 to file a report that should have been made immediately to the NIH Office of Science Policy, which oversees U.S. research with genetically manipulated organisms like the engineered H5N1 influenza virus involved in the experiment. Records show the university's internal biosafety committee, which had approved the Kawaoka lab's research, wasn't apprised of the Dec. 9, 2019, incident until Feb. 5, 2020. The university was less slow in reporting the incident to the federal funding officials at NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which provided the grant for the controversial experiments. But UW still waited 10 days until Dec. 19, 2019 to report the incident to NIAID program staff, according to information provided to me in writing by NIH officials. The grant's terms required immediate notification in the event of an illness or exposure. It was UW's contention, however, that neither of the two criteria were met because there was no reasonable risk of virus exposure, NIH officials told me. When the university eventually notified grant officials, it said it was doing so in the spirit of transparency and responsible conduct of research, the NIH said. UW officials, who for months wouldn't answer many of my questions about the incident, eventually said that Kawaoka informed his program officer at NIH in early December, before following up with an incident summary on Dec. 19.

NIH said that the first time UW contacted anyone at the agency was on Dec. 12, 2019 three days after the incident. That's when UW first requested a phone call from an NIAID program officer. A first discussion about the incident happened on Dec. 13, and on Dec. 16, during a follow-up discussion, NIAID staff asked UW to send in a written description of the incident. Both NIAID Director Anthony Fauci and NIAID Principal Deputy Director Hugh Auchincloss were briefed about the incident, the NIH said in a written response to my questions. But NIH would not tell me when Fauci and Auchincloss were briefed or whether they provided guidance on how the UW incident should be handled. UW officials said Kawaoka's lab immediately reported the incident to the CDC's select agent lab regulators. But the university didn't answer my questions about why the incident was immediately reported to the CDC and not NIH given UW's stated position that there wasn't any potential exposure. It is unclear whether Kawaoka's team consulted the CDC in advance of the university's decision to release the researcher from quarantine. CDC officials including Dr. Samuel Edwin, who heads the select agent program didn't answer my questions about this. University notified federal oversight team 2 months after lab accident When the university finally notified the NIH Office of Science Policy about the ferret incident two months after it happened UW officials unsuccessfully tried to justify their significant delay by saying the incident was not reportable because even though the trainee's PAPR tube had detached, in their view there was no potential exposure. The university's justifications, records show, included that the ferrets had been handled inside a biosafety cabinet and that the contact ferrets had been exposed to infected ferrets for only about 24 hours and were not shedding virus yet. The university also told NIH officials that the air the observer would have breathed during the few seconds the hose was disconnected would have come from inside the PAPR hood, which would have been HEPA-filtered before the hose disconnected. The lab's report to the NIH doesn't say how they determined this. The reason UW finally told the NIH oversight office about the incident was because lab regulators at the Federal Select Agent Program as well as the NIH office that funded the research recommended it be reported. The report UW finally submitted to the NIH Office of Science Policy includes the following notation: Confidential do not release this information without written authorization of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. What were the consequences of UW's delayed reporting of the incident? The NIH Office of Science Policy told me it reminded the institution about its reporting responsibilities, and noted that it should have been immediately reported to OSP. If NIH delivered that message, UW officials say they never heard it. This is certainly the kind of information we would have remembered or recorded in notes taken at the time, a UW spokesperson said by email. UW repeatedly pointed to a short email from an NIH analyst thanking the university for its Feb. 10, 2020, report and adding that the actions taken in response to this incident appear appropriate. NIH says this email referred only to UW's biosafety actions, not to the university's failure to file an immediate report. In the end, the trainee apparently didn't become infected. But how the university and the lab oversight system handled the incident should be cause for concern. It is all too easy to sensationalize this research, to misconstrue events, and misrepresent the nature of incidents rightfully reported by institutions to regulatory agencies, said Kelly Tyrrell, UW's director of media relations, in a email that spoke in broad brushstrokes about the importance of research, the humanity of researchers, and how sometimes there can be differences in interpretations of incident reporting requirements and about regulations. Tyrrell said that UW takes safety seriously, and that the Kawaoka lab has never had an incident where public health or safety have been put at risk. There are few people in the world trained to understand the nature of the pathogens involved, the biosafety and biosecurity measures in place and the protocols developed and followed, Tyrrell continued. Most people are also not equipped to appropriately evaluate the risk. It is unfortunate that some seek to capitalize on this knowledge gap.

{"id": "292", "title": "Avian flu is killing endangered California condors at alarming rate, federal data suggests", "date": "2023-04-12", "fulltext": "The avian influenza stalking wild and domestic bird flocks across the country has killed at least six endangered California condors since March and is suspected of killing another dozen. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Wednesday it's now attributing all condor deaths in the Arizona-Utah wild flying population to suspected cases of the virus. The deaths represent 15% of the region's condor population. Observers with The Peregrine Fund first saw a sick condor in northern Arizona on March 9, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. The condor was found dead under her nest 11 days later, and testing confirmed she was positive for the highly contagious flu. Since then, 17 condors have died and five others are receiving supporting care and being tested, the wildlife service said. The highly contagious avian flu, H5N1, has affected more than 58 million birds in domestic poultry populations and wild flocks across the U.S. and continues to spread, federal officials report. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza has been confirmed by lab tests as the cause of mortality for three CA condors found in northern AZ. Other deceased birds have been collected & are undergoing testing... The spread of avian flu The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says bird flu primarily strikes animals, but it has been detected in at least four human cases in the United States. An 11-year-old girl died of the flu in Cambodia in late February. Since January 2022, 11 cases of H5N1 have been reported in people. The first 10 were exposed to poultry. Investigation into how the 11th person, a patient in Chile, was infected is ongoing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on March 30. Symptoms include eye redness, flulike upper respiratory symptoms that range from mild to severe, fever and body aches. As of March 10, the H5N1 virus had been detected in wild birds or poultry in 16 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and in most of the rest of the world, according to the CDC. H5N1 has exploded across the U.S. since its first detection here in wild birds in January 2022. The virus has been documented in every state but Hawaii and across every Canadian province. Other species affected Millions of chickens and other domestic fowl have been euthanized and the virus has been detected in more than 140 bird species.

{"id": "293", "title": "Bird Flu Keeps Raging. Some Say Vaccines Are Needed to Stop It. Poultry-industry groups fear inoculating against the virus would hurt exports", "date": "2023-04-14", "fulltext": "To stop the devastating global bird-flu outbreak that has killed over 100 million poultry, the U.S. and Europe are embracing a tactic many countries have long resisted: vaccines. The U.S. and parts of Europe don't routinely inoculate poultry against bird flu, which emerges every few years and spreads and kills easily, but typically recedes after domestic birds are culled. Groups representing U.S. poultry companies have historically opposed vaccinating birds over concerns that inoculation could imperil trade. There are also questions about the logistics and cost of administering shots that must be injected into each chick or egg. But the unprecedented destruction of this outbreak, which has felled 58 million farmed birds in the U.S. and is running into its third year in Europe, has driven governments and businesses to search for options. Animal-health and pharmaceutical companies including Zoetis Inc., Ceva Animal Health, Boehringer Ingelheim and Merck & Co. have developed vaccines that are in testing. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's research service expects results from tests of four vaccines in chickens in late May or early June, said Erica Spackman, a bird-flu expert at the agency. Two test vaccines were made by USDA labs and two were developed for past flu outbreaks by Merck and Zoetis. Tests in turkeys and ducks will follow. If effective, any vaccine would need additional approval within the agency before wider use. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What questions or concerns do you have about the global bird-flu outbreak? Join the conversation below. France, the world's top producer of foie gras, this month said it intends to buy 80 million vaccine doses and invited companies to bid for government contracts. Some 21 million birds in the country were culled there as of last summer, and over 200 more outbreaks occurred by the end of the year. The current dominant strain globally is a version of the H5N1 virus that triggered destruction in Europe in 2021. It was detected in U.S. wild birds in January 2022, and a few weeks later was found in commercial turkey flocks. More than 58 million commercial or backyard birds have died, with detections of the virus in wild birds in 49 states, according to the USDA. In the past few months, South American countries have reported contagious, deadly bird flu for the first time. It has also sickened and killed mammal species including skunks, raccoons, bobcats, bears, seals and mountain lions. The seasonal virus has shifted to linger for years in wild birds, which pass it to commercial birds. \"It's a biological change in the virus,\" said David Swayne, a former director of a USDA laboratory that studied the disease. \"I don't think we know genetically what's changed, but it's changed such that it's spread through the wild bird population.\" The persistent circulation in wild birds is \"absolutely novel\" for the Americas, said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Water birds are likely hosts of the virus, and with the spring migration to the Northern Hemisphere under way, scientists are watching for a surge in cases. Some countries have endemic versions of the bird-flu virus and regularly vaccinate poultry. But many of those countries don't have a big trade presence, according to Leslie Sims, an avian-flu expert and consultant based in Melbourne, Australia, who has advised governments on animal-disease prevention and control. \"Traditionally, countries have not traded with countries that vaccinate,\" said John Clifford, a former chief veterinary officer at the USDA and a consultant on trade for the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council. Objections range from concerns that some vaccinated birds will still get sick to the high cost of surveillance required of flocks after a vaccination round, Dr. Clifford said. The National Chicken Council, which represents companies that produce about 95% of U.S. chickens bred for meat, opposes vaccination because it would threaten $5 billion in annual chicken exports, said spokesman Tom Super. France has backed tests of two vaccines in ducks, including an RNA vaccine made by French company Ceva tailored to the current strain of the virus. Another set of French tests involve a vaccine developed by German pharmaceutical and animal-health company Boehringer Ingelheim that contains a synthetic bird-flu virus surface protein, hemagglutinin, that is injected into the birds, said Jean-Luc Guérin, chair of avian biosecurity at the National Veterinary School in Toulouse. Dr. Guérin said results of these tests will be released within a few weeks The Dutch government has funded research testing vaccines in chickens and is backing field tests and pilots at farms, according to the agricultural ministry. Six million birds were culled in the country because of the outbreak. In preliminary results reported in March, one research group said that two of four vaccines tested protected chickens against infection by the current variant and prevented the transmission of the disease, according to Sjaak de Wit, professor of veterinary medicine specializing in poultry viruses at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and a member of the team that conducted the tests. The two effective vaccines, one made by Ceva and the other by Boehringer Ingelheim, both involve a harmless turkey virus that is engineered to include genetic instructions to make hemagglutinin, the bird-flu protein. The engineered virus is injected into the bird, where it multiplies and simultaneously manufactures the protein. John El-Attrache, global director at the science and investigation department at Ceva, said South American countries including Paraguay, Ecuador and Uruguay are close to licensing Ceva's turkey-virus vaccine for bird flu. It isn't clear how to stop the virus among wild birds, who continue to harbor and spread infections, said Daniel Perez, a virologist at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia. \"We have to think beyond the chickens in the chicken house,\" Dr. Perez said.

{"id": "294", "title": "Bird flu: Scientists find mutations, say threat is still low", "date": "2023-04-14", "fulltext": "NEW YORK (AP) — A man in Chile is infected with a bird flu that has concerning mutations, but the threat to people from the virus remains low, U.S. health officials said Friday. Past animal studies suggest these mutations could cause the virus to be more harmful or spread more easily, health officials said. But they also said there is no evidence that the mutations would make it easier for it to take root in a person’s upper lungs — a development that would raise concerns about spread among people. The mutations do not change public health officials’ assessment of the overall risk to people from the H5N1 virus, which 'continues to be low,' said Vivien Dugan of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The mutations, which have appeared only in the one hospitalized patient, may have occurred after the man got sick, CDC officials said. There’s no evidence that the mutated virus spread to other people, mixed with other flu viruses, or developed the ability to fight off current medicines or evade vaccines, agency officials said. Such genetic changes have been seen in past bird flu infections. Nevertheless, it’s important to continue to look carefully at every instance of human infection, Dugan said. 'We need to remain vigilant for changes that would make these viruses more dangerous to people.' This type of flu, called Type A H5N1, was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, when visitors to live poultry markets caught it. Sporadic outbreaks have followed, and more than 450 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of infected people got it directly from birds. As bird flu hits other species, however, scientists fear the virus could evolve to spread more easily among people. And it has been spreading widely, to birds and animals in scores of countries. In the U.S., it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks across the country. Since the beginning of last year, tens of millions of chickens have died of the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading, one of the reasons cited for soaring U.S. egg prices. The new lab analysis looked at the virus found in the lungs of a 53-year-old man living in Chile’s Antofagasta region. It may be that he became infected through contact with sick or dead birds or infected sea lions, according to a WHO summary of the case. The man was healthy and had not traveled recently. On March 13, he started getting a cough, sore throat and hoarseness, the WHO said. His symptoms worsened and he eventually was sent to an intensive care unit and treated with antiviral medicines and antibiotics. He is still hospitalized and being monitored, CDC officials said. Genetic sequencing this week revealed the two concerning mutations. Chilean and American health officials have been working together on the investigation. Andrew Pekosz, a flu researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said he hasn't seen the preliminary analysis of the Chilean patient's infection. 'When these viruses get into humans, there's a likelihood that they start to adapt to grow better in us, and this is a sign that is happening,' he said. There are three or four kinds of mutations that would need to be seen in a H5N1 virus before that would really raise the alarm signal that something is happening of concern, he added. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

{"id": "295", "title": "Bird Flu Sample from Chilean Man Showed Some Signs of Adaptation to Mammals", "date": "2023-04-14", "fulltext": "These changes were unlikely to be enough to allow the virus to spread easily among humans, and the health risk to the public remains low, experts said. A sample of avian influenza isolated from a Chilean man who fell ill last month contains two genetic mutations that are signs of adaptation to mammals, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday. In experimental animal studies, the mutations, both of which are in what is known as the PB2 gene, have previously been shown to help the virus replicate better in mammalian cells. The risk to the public remains low, health officials said, and no additional human cases have been linked to the Chilean man, who remains hospitalized. Moreover, the sample was missing other critical genetic changes that scientists believe would be necessary for the virus, known as H5N1, to spread efficiently among humans, including mutations that would stabilize the virus and help it bind more tightly to human cells. 'There are three major categories of changes we think H5 has to undergo to switch from being a bird virus to being a human virus,' said Richard J. Webby, a bird flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. 'The sequences from the person in Chile have one of those classes of changes. But we also know that of those three sets of changes, this is the easiest one for the virus to make.' PB2 mutations have been found in other mammals infected with this version of the virus, as well as in some people infected with other versions of H5N1. The mutations most likely emerged in the Chilean patient over the course of his infection, experts said. 'We understand them to be a step on the path to adaptation to humans and increased risk to humans,' said Anice C. Lowen, an influenza virologist at Emory University. 'So certainly it's concerning to see them.' But these mutations alone are probably not sufficient to produce a virus that spreads easily among humans, she added. 'Those genetic changes have been seen previously with past H5N1 infections, and have not resulted in spread between people,' Vivien Dugan, acting director of the influenza division at the C.D.C.'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a statement. 'Nevertheless, it's important to continue to look carefully at every instance of human infection, as well as other mammalian spillover events, and to track viral evolution in birds,' Dr. Dugan said. 'We need to remain vigilant for changes that would make these viruses more dangerous to people.' The sample was sequenced by the National Influenza Center in Chile and uploaded to GISAID, an international database of viral genomes, overnight, C.D.C. officials said. Chile's Ministry of Health reported the case to the World Health Organization on March 29. The patient, a 53-year-old man, developed respiratory symptoms, including a cough and a sore throat, and was hospitalized when his condition deteriorated, according to the W.H.O. Investigation into the case is continuing, and how the man became infected remains unclear. But the virus had recently been detected in birds and sea lions in the region where the man lives. 'According to the preliminary findings of the local epidemiological investigation, the most plausible hypothesis about transmission is that it occurred through environmental exposure to areas where either sick or dead birds or sea mammals were found close to the residence of the case,' the W.H.O. reported last week. It is the 11th reported human case of H5N1 since January 2022, according to the C.D.C., none of which have been associated with human-to-human transmission. Since H5N1 was first detected in birds in 1996, there have been hundreds of human infections globally, mostly in people who were in close contact with birds. Still, experts have long been worried about the possibility that avian influenza, which is well adapted to birds, might evolve to spread more easily among humans, potentially setting off another pandemic. An H5N1 outbreak on a Spanish mink farm last fall suggests that the virus is capable of adapting to spread more efficiently among at least some mammals. And every human infection gives the virus more opportunities to adapt. The mutations documented in the Chilean patient are a 'step in the wrong direction,' Dr. Lowen said. This version of the virus has spread rapidly through wild birds in the Americas, sparking regular outbreaks in farmed poultry.

{"id": "296", "title": "Current avian flu strain deadlier than in past and could become endemic, study says", "date": "2023-04-19", "fulltext": "Scientists raise alarm over avian influenza strain's unprecedented deadliness and reach from farmed poultry and wild birds. The current strain of the avian influenza, which has been decimating bird populations globally, is perilously different than previous disease outbreaks, according to US researchers who are calling for urgent action. A new study led by a team from the University of Maryland found that the current strain of the disease that is killing millions of birds is different from previous decades, with birds dying in unprecedented numbers. 'We've been dealing with low pathogenic avian influenza for decades in the poultry industry, but this is different,' said Jennifer Mullinax, co-author of the study and an assistant professor at the University of Maryland's department of environmental science and technology. 'This high pathogenic virus is wiping out everything in numbers that we've never seen before,' said Mullinax. The study, published in Conservation Biology, was conducted by tracking the arrival and progression of the lethal avian flu outbreak in North America to see how the latest upsurge of the disease compares to previous ones. Researchers analyzed five different data sources that had information on the presence of avian flu among wild birds and poultry in the US and Canada as well as a global database that had information from 2014 until 2023. Unlike the 2015 outbreak of avian flu (H5N8), the outbreak seen in late 2021 (H5N1) has caused mass mortality for wild birds, which makes the highly pathogenic virus more difficult to wipe out. 'Unlike H5N8, this disease is heavily impacting wild birds,' said Johanna Harvey, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland. 'It's difficult to estimate how many birds are truly affected across wild populations, but we're seeing dramatic disease impacts in raptors, sea birds and colonial nesting birds. And we now have the highest amount of poultry loss to avian influenza, so this is a worst-case scenario.' Some 58 million domestic poultry were infected or were killed to stop the spread of infection in the US, as well as 7 million in Canada, researchers found. The latest outbreak of avian flu may have also shifted to a year-round disease from a more seasonal disease in previous outbreaks. The 2015 avian flu outbreak generally happened in the fall, when farmers could prepare and have more time to recover from losses. But the latest outbreak is occurring throughout the year, in the summertime for wild birds and during the spring and fall for domestic poultry. Researchers concluded that the deadly impact of the disease on wild birds and the change from seasonal infections to ones occurring year-round could signal a dangerous change in the avian flu in the US. The team also concluded that the avian flu will probably become endemic, which could affect food security and the economy. The study called for coordination between national and regional leaders to manage the spread of the disease. 'This paper illustrates how unprecedented it is, and describes what we think is coming. It's really a call to arms saying: we can't afford to address this in our individual silos,' said Mullinax. As of December, more than 140 million birds have died in the US, the UK and the EU from bird flu. The strain has also been found in some mammals, including in bears in the US and wild dogs in a zoo in the UK, as well as a sporadic number of human cases. In a report in March this year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said: 'Since 2022, despite the wide geographic spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses in wild birds and to poultry worldwide, with sporadic spillover to mammals, only a small number of sporadic human cases of A(H5N1) have been identified.

{"id": "297", "title": "Avian flu outbreak in the Gambia threatens birds on East Atlantic Flyway", "date": "2023-04-23", "fulltext": "Hundreds of dead birds found in past three weeks as conservationists call for international funding to help stop the disease spreading on migration routes An outbreak of avian influenza in seabirds in the Gambia could affect vast numbers of birds migrating along the East Atlantic Flyway, unless international funding is secured, warn conservationists. Teams from the West African Bird Study Association (Wabsa), the Gambia's Department of Parks and Wildlife Management, and UK-based NGO Conservation Without Borders have buried hundreds of dead birds over the past three weeks, including some ringed birds from Europe. The Gambia's Ministry of Agriculture confirmed the H5N1 outbreak on 4 April after analysing samples from Tanji bird reserve, about 12 miles from the capital, Banjul. The East Atlantic Flyway links bird migration routes from the Arctic Circle to southern Africa via western Europe. It's migration season, so these outbreaks threaten birds and poultry all the way from Africa to Europe and the UK, said Sacha Dench, founder of Conservation Without Borders and an ambassador for the UN's Convention on Migratory Species, who saw more than 500 dead seabirds at two sites last week at the Tanji bird reserve. The local conservation organisation [Wabsa] is expected to respond yet can't even afford the £4 boat fuel to go to Bijol Islands, Dench said. The cost of it spreading is so much more than simply surveillance and control by good field workers. Many low- to-middle-income countries have limited conservation funds, she added. Most rely on international funding and some money from tourism to pay for the services of local park staff. But when an emergency like bird flu hits, the government has priorities like chicken being important protein for local people. Rapid reaction is critical. So having staff on the ground with the resources that enable them to act is essential, said Dench, who secured temporary funds for the boat fuel. She has written to ask the UK government to help fund the surveillance and disposal of infected birds, a critical matter for the government at a time when the UK's bird flu restrictions on free-range poultry are only just being lifted. Investing in monitoring activities in developing countries would save a lot of birds we love, and could save [the poultry farming] industry a lot of money, said Dench, who hopes that other national governments could also support the Gambia's avian flu recovery efforts. This is more than conservation, this is management of a global pandemic, and we should at least be offering assistance to those with less resources on the migration flyways that the UK sits right at the centre of. Fagimba Camara, head of the research unit at Wabsa, who has been monitoring the Bijol Islands and digging holes in the sand to bury dead birds, says that minimising spread of infection is a big task. This is the most important place for migratory species in the Gambia because we record so many in large numbers, including royal terns, Caspian terns, ruddy turnstones and osprey, which fly from Scotland and other parts of Europe for their wintering time. At the beginning of the month, Camara found 246 dead birds. This week, his team found 107, mainly royal terns. At least we are seeing the number of affected birds decreasing [on Bijol Islands], he said, although numbers are increasing elsewhere in the Gambia. Awa Joof, research officer for Wabsa, said: The most difficult thing to do is dig bird graves, so it is definitely so sad for me to see birds dying in such large numbers.

{"id": "298", "title": "Farne Islands to remain closed after three new cases of bird flu detected", "date": "2023-04-25", "fulltext": "National Trust rangers brace for second year of mass deaths on islands off Northumberland coast A group of islands that make up one of the UK’s most important bird sanctuaries are to remain closed after new cases of avian flu were detected. The disease devastated the seabird population of the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland, last year and National Trust rangers expect thousands more deaths this year. The discovery of three new cases led to the announcement, on Tuesday, that the islands will be off limits until the end of August when the breeding season comes to an end. The popular sail-round tours of the islands offered by local boat operators will continue. The Farne Islands are home to an abundance of birdlife including puffins, shags, guillemots, eiders, fulmars, kittiwakes and Arctic terns which, after Northumberland, epically migrate to Antarctica. Last year, because of avian flu, 6,000 bird carcasses were removed. That figure, experts said, was likely to be far below the true number, since many dead birds in the densely packed cliff colonies would have fallen into the sea. Thousands of seabirds are returning to the islands and the positive cases have left rangers braced for a repeat of last year. Harriet Reid, lead ranger for the islands, said: “Sadly, with confirmed cases there is a strong likelihood that we will see thousands of birds affected by the virus again this year.” Many of the bird species on the islands are rare or struggling because of the climate crisis. “By restricting access to the islands for visitors and limiting disturbance which can cause distress to sick birds and potentially increase the transmission of bird flu we hope to give the birds the best chance of survival,” said Reid. National Trust has been caring for the islands, home to about 200,000 seabirds annually, for nearly a century. There are no records, the trust said, of anything so potentially damaging to the already endangered colonies. Ben McCarthy, the head of nature conservation at the National Trust, said the impact of avian flu on the wild birds was “unprecedented” with the high density of colonies making birds visiting the Farne Islands more susceptible. “We are working with partners to investigate measures to mitigate the impacts as well as better understand the long-term impacts of this pernicious disease,” he said. The islands are also home to one of England’s largest grey seal colonies. To see them, the public will have to use companies such as Billy Shiel Farne Island boats, which has been operating trips since 1918. Rachel Shiel, from the firm, said people could still see the birds and seals at close quarters. She added: “These trips provide a fantastic vantage of the fabulous Farne Islands without disturbing the important work being undertaken by the National Trust to monitor and protect the wildlife.”", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "By restricting access to the islands for visitors and limiting disturbance which can cause distress to sick birds and potentially increase the transmission of bird flu we hope to give the birds the best chance of survival.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The high density of colonies making birds visiting the Farne Islands more susceptible.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "By restricting access to the islands for visitors and limiting disturbance which can cause distress to sick birds and potentially increase the transmission of bird flu.", "affirm_why_count": 2, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "The disease devastated the seabird population of the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland, last year and National Trust rangers expect thousands more deaths this year.", "affirm_keywords_statement_2": "Last year, because of avian flu, 6,000 bird carcasses were removed.", "affirm_keywords_statement_3": "Thousands of seabirds are returning to the islands and the positive cases have left rangers braced for a repeat of last year.", "affirm_keywords_statement_4": "“Sadly, with confirmed cases there is a strong likelihood that we will see thousands of birds affected by the virus again this year.”", "affirm_keywords_statement_5": "“By restricting access to the islands for visitors and limiting disturbance which can cause distress to sick birds and potentially increase the transmission of bird flu we hope to give the birds the best chance of survival,” said Reid.", "affirm_keywords_statement_6": "Ben McCarthy, the head of nature conservation at the National Trust, said the impact of avian flu on the wild birds was “unprecedented” with the high density of colonies making birds visiting the Farne Islands more susceptible.", "affirm_keywords_statement_7": "“We are working with partners to investigate measures to mitigate the impacts as well as better understand the long-term impacts of this pernicious disease,” he said.", "affirm_keywords_count": 7, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates. Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast. Conservationists have warned Australia is poorly prepared for the potential arrival of a deadly form of avian influenza that has killed millions of birds and thousands of mammals overseas. When HPAI H5 (high pathogenicity avian influenza of subtype H5) arrived in South America late last year it killed more than 60,000 seabirds and 3,500 sea lions within weeks in Peru alone. It has spread to every continent except Australia and Antarctica, and has so far affected 300 species of wild birds and caused hundreds of mass mortality events. The Invasive Species Council (ISC) has written to the agriculture minister, Murray Watt, and the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, to urge them to develop a national response plan for avian influenza in wildlife. Australia is well prepared to respond to avian influenza infection in poultry, having previously eradicated it eight times, but there is no plan for wildlife, the ISC's principal policy analyst, Carol Booth, said. The council is urging the government to establish a national taskforce, with membership including environmental and biosecurity agencies from all governments and a range of wildlife, disease and conservation experts. Booth said while eradication was not feasible for outbreaks in wild birds, there were steps the government could take to minimise the impacts on wildlife and help recovery. They included monitoring, reporting and research to assess impacts, learn about the disease and help with recovery; regulating human access to bird colonies to prevent disturbance; removing and disposing of dead birds; rescuing and euthanising wildlife; vaccinating captive-bred colonies of threatened species and developing local responses for specific bird colonies.

The risk of the virus arriving in Australia has been considered low because there are no duck species, one of the main movers of the virus, migrating to Australia. But experts have warned the risk the virus will arrive is increasing and that this would most likely occur through migratory shorebirds, which are also hosts for the virus. Every spring 8m shorebirds fly to Australia along the east Asia/Australasia flyway. Booth said Australia had invested millions of dollars preparing for the arrival of livestock diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease in cattle, African swine fever in pigs and avian influenza in poultry. She said there had not been a similar level of preparation for major wildlife diseases and this was a major gap in Australian biosecurity. The situation is more complex in native species. Unlike livestock, native animals cannot be culled or contained and the consequences are potentially direr, she said. Leanne Renwick, the senior technical research officer for Phillip Island Nature Parks, which manages the famous penguin parade on Phillip Island as well as doing conservation work and research, said the organisation had been monitoring the rapid spread of avian influenza globally and had been considering a local response plan. We have a lot of different species here but particularly large seabird colonies and Ramsar wetlands, she said. We are definitely concerned about what the potential impact could be in Australia and here on Phillip Island. The agriculture minister, Murray Watt, said any suggestion we are not prepared is made without basis. He said his department had been closely monitoring the global HPAI situation, particularly the surge in cases and bird mortalities occurring overseas since 2020, and considering this in the context of Australia's preparedness.

{"id": "300", "title": "California condors in Arizona, Utah died from avian flu", "date": "2023-05-01", "fulltext": "PHOENIX (AP) — Twenty California condors in northern Arizona and southern Utah have died since March, and half of the endangered birds tested positive for a strain of avian flu, according to authorities. Four condors are still receiving supportive care and have shown improvement. But wildlife officials told The Arizona Republic that they are worried the recent outbreak could potentially spread to other condor populations. So far, authorities say, the virus hasn’t been detected in the other condor populations in California or Baja California, Mexico. The Peregrine Fund, a group that manages wild populations of the bird, estimates there are 116 wild condors flying over Arizona and Utah and occupying the landscape within Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Vermillion Cliffs National Park, on the Kaibab Plateau and in surrounding areas. “The condor is slow to mature, taking up to eight years before they can produce young, and with an average of one young every other year, the rate of replacement for a loss in the wild is a big impact,” Chris Parish, president and CEO of the Peregrine Fund, told the Republic. “Given the total number of birds we eventually lose and the age structure of those lost will have a tremendous impact on the recovery effort, likely to take decades.” The California condor has been protected as an endangered species since 1967. Fewer than 25 condors remained in the wild by 1982 until an effort was launched to capture the remaining birds and start a breeding program. The first condor was released into the wild in 1995, and the first wild-born condor arrived in 2003. Before the recent string of deaths, the National Park Service said only 334 condors remained in the wild. According to avian disease experts, it’s likely that migration patterns are aiding the spread of avian flu during this current outbreak. They said avian flu historically dies out after a season. But this strain has been spreading for a longer period and has affected birds since last spring. Virologists aren’t sure why the strain is persisting longer than normal, and studies are still underway to understand the cause.

{"id": "301", "title": "Biden administration is testing four vaccines in hopes of fighting avian flu", "date": "2023-05-03", "fulltext": "Agriculture officials in the Biden administration are testing four vaccines in hopes of stanching the latest outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza that has devastated U.S. poultry farms and driven up egg prices, with plans to launch a national vaccination campaign that would be the first-ever effort of its kind. Two of the vaccines being tested by the U.S. Department of Agriculture were developed by that agency. The others, from animal drugmaker Zoetis and Merck Animal Health, were developed during the last large-scale outbreak in 2015 and not used, a USDA spokesman said. Should the trials be successful, the next stage is identifying manufacturers, with many more steps before laying hens, domesticated turkeys and broilers are vaccinated. In a best-case scenario, the agency estimates an 18- to 24-month timeline before having a commercial quantity of vaccine available that matches the currently circulating virus strain, but the timeline could be expedited in an emergency. Although there is little concern that the virus, known as H5N1 avian flu, could spark a human pandemic, it has become a major headache for the world's poultry farmers. This has been the largest and most deadly outbreak ever. Nearly 60 million farm-raised birds in the United States have died or been killed to stop the virus's spread. The virus has also contributed to sky-high egg prices. But while 'eggflation' has calmed temporarily, bird flu has not flown the coop. Historically, avian flu outbreaks have come and gone. The virus went undetected in the United States for several years but reemerged in 2022 and has been present in North America ever since. But what is often a seasonal problem, peaking in spring and summer months with the movement of wild migratory birds, now seems not to be going away. Experts say there are indications that the current aggressive strain may have become permanent in North America, part of a new normal to which the poultry industry must adapt. 'The virus really spread from the Atlantic Coast westward across the U.S. and is now being detected in all 50 states, including Alaska,' Nichola Hill, a professor in the biology department at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, said in a briefing last week. 'So, we've seen continuous circulation in North America since that time, and it's raised the question of whether this virus is now endemic.' Despite efforts to contain the virus, it has continued to spread among bird species and recently jumped to mammals. There have been no documented cases of human-to-human transmission, and people known to have been sickened worked closely with poultry. But it poses dangers for pets and means more uncertainty ahead for the cost of eggs. Egg prices fell by almost 11 percent last month, according to government data. Seth Meyer, chief economist for the USDA, optimistically predicted in February that wholesale egg prices would fall even further and total egg production would increase this year. But this prediction assumes there will not be continued avian flu outbreaks. And this, say many veterinarians and poultry experts, is wishful thinking. Egg prices overall had been trending upward in the United States since the current strain of avian flu struck, increasing by 155 percent between the beginning of 2022 and the start of this year. Eggs became the go-to example as food prices rose more broadly, surging to $4.25 per dozen in December, which put pressure on Americans' pocketbooks and drove up the costs of foods that contained eggs. Some people frustrated with the spiraling prices went so far as to decorate potatoes this Easter. (The Potatoes USA promotion board nudged that idea along.) Analysts at Rabobank, a financial services provider, predict egg prices will remain elevated globally, with even higher prices in countries where strong avian flu pressures persist. Persistently high prices and scarcity could pose a particular challenge for low-income consumers because eggs are an important staple food, high in protein and nutrients. More than 254 million birds have died of it or been depopulated worldwide, said David Swayne, a poultry veterinarian who specializes in avian flu, on a recent call with reporters. It is now considered a 'panzootic,' meaning a pandemic in wild animals: Last month, 3,500 sea lions succumbed to it in Peru, according to Peru's national parks service. Scientists have detected the virus in more than 100 species of wild birds, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have documented infections in bears, foxes, skunks, farmed mink and zoo animals such as tigers and leopards. Earlier this month, avian flu was linked to the deaths of three pet cats in Nebraska. 'This happens when our pets are predating on dead birds,' Hill said. 'We knew that this moment would arrive when pets would be affected. If you're walking a dog, keep it on a leash to keep it away from wildlife, and keep cats indoors.' Hill said the transmission to mammals may be happening via waterborne transmission, meaning mammals such as whales and seals are getting it from a virus in the water, which can lead to mass mortality events. Or transmission is happening when animals such as foxes feed on dead, infected birds such as ducks. The USDA said its Agricultural Research Service began avian influenza vaccination trials in April. They expect data on the efficacy of a single-dose vaccine in May and the results of a two-dose vaccine challenge in June. Widespread vaccination could be expensive and logistically complicated, said Yuko Sato, a veterinary professor at Iowa State University. As with the coronavirus, it's a virus that keeps changing, so a vaccine that worked on an earlier version of the virus might not do the job long-term. 'You'd want to give one shot and then a second shot two weeks later, but there are 300 million laying hens,' said Sato, adding that there are also 9.6 billion broilers raised for the meat industry. An effort of that magnitude would have significant costs that would be passed on to consumers' grocery bills. Also, Sato said, once birds are vaccinated, they may not show symptoms of the virus even when infected, so it might make detection much harder. 'Vaccines are not a silver bullet and won't prevent infection,' she said. Because of this, some experts worry that widespread vaccination could hurt poultry exports, making it harder for chicken farmers to prove to trading partners that animals are free from disease. (In the last big bird flu outbreak, in 2015, U.S. chicken exports dropped by $1.1 billion, according to USDA data.) The National Chicken Council, the trade association of meat chickens, does not support the use of a vaccine, said Tom Super, senior vice president of communications for the council. He said most countries, including the United States, won't import vaccinated poultry due to concerns that vaccines can mask the presence of the disease. 'The vaccine will not eliminate the virus,' he said. 'Birds can still get [the virus] and may not show signs.' Carol Cardona, Pomeroy chair in avian health at the University of Minnesota, said vaccination would make it more possible to predict and to protect domesticated birds. She warned that not vaccinating could also carry costs and that some animals, such as turkeys, are naturally more vulnerable to the virus. 'Not being reactive is half the battle,' she said. 'That's why we have to do vaccination. Why would you not? We have the science. It will take a while, and that means we need to start sooner rather than later.' Sato said that in the last outbreak, in 2015, much of the spread was from farm to farm, truck tires and dirty boots dragging the virus with them. Heightened biosecurity measures, such as quarantining animals and limiting visitors to facilities, have minimized this, but still, if just a few birds test positive for H5N1, the whole flock is killed and disposed of to minimize spread - which increases costs associated with raising replacement birds, but also for protective gear for workers who must deal with infected animals. According to Swayne, there have been 874 human cases of avian flu since 1997, about 40 percent fatal. Most of the humans who have contracted avian flu since 1997 have been people who worked with poultry or who have been in 'wet' markets where animals are slaughtered.

The vivid blue irises of northern gannets turn black if they survive avian flu, according to a study which provides evidence that some wild birds are shaking off the deadly virus. Avian flu has killed wild and domestic birds for decades but the current strain (H5N1) severely affected seabird populations across the North Atlantic last year, with particularly high death rates among gannets. Scientists from several organisations investigated the timings of avian flu outbreaks at colonies across their North Atlantic range, with a detailed study of the impact of the virus on the Bass Rock, Scotland, home of the largest gannet colony in the world. Black irises instead of the usual pale blue were first seen in gannets breeding on the Bass in June last year, with colour varying from completely black to mottled. Researchers took blood samples from 18 apparently healthy adult gannets with both normal and black irises. The samples were tested for bird flu antibodies to determine whether the birds had been infected previously. Eight tested positive, of which seven had black irises. Dr Jude Lane, a conservation scientist for the RSPB and lead author of the study, said the 'fascinating' discovery that gannets that had survived avian flu infection no longer had the usual iris coloration could prove a useful non-invasive diagnostic tool. 'The next steps are to understand its efficacy, if it applies to any other species and whether there are any detrimental impacts to the birds' vision,' she said. 'Ophthalmology exams will also be needed to determine what is causing the black coloration.' High numbers of dead gannets were first spotted in Iceland in April last year. By the end of June, bird flu outbreaks had occurred in five Canadian colonies and in the Channel Islands. Outbreaks in 12 British and Irish colonies followed in a clockwise pattern with the last infected colonies recorded in September. Unusually high mortality was recorded at all but one of the 41 monitored colonies (75% of the 53 North Atlantic colonies of gannets). On the Bass, the researchers calculated that survival rates of adult birds between 2021 and 2022 was 42% lower than the preceding 10-year average. The full extent of how many birds died during that period will not be confirmed until the birds return this breeding season. The Farne Islands, a popular archipelago of seabird breeding islands off the Northumberland coast, are closed to visitors because of new outbreaks of avian flu this spring. The study was a collaboration between the RSPB, the University of Glasgow, the University of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt University and the Animal Plant Health Agency, in partnership with the Scottish Seabird Centre.

{"id": "303", "title": "�e feel more prepared� Farne Islands face another season battling avian flu", "date": "2023-05-04", "fulltext": "Hazmat suits have replaced tourists at the important UK sanctuary for breeding seabirds off coast of Northumberland. 'It was a very challenging year,' Harriet Reid said with considerable understatement as she reflected on a horrendous 2022 for one of the UK's most important sanctuaries for breeding seabirds. 'But we've learned a great deal and we feel more prepared.' Reid is the National Trust's area ranger responsible for the Farne Islands off the coast of Northumberland, home to an abundance of seabirds, many of them threatened species. By Thursday, most of the different species of birds that come annually to the islands had arrived. In the sky, Arctic terns were swooping majestically while puffins bombed towards their destination far less elegantly, their panic-stricken wings frantically flapping. On the island's rocky shores, Eider ducks had made their nests and were settled while drakes hung around in gangs, not quite sure what their next job was. There were also shags, fulmars, kittiwakes and then guillemots, often mistaken for little penguins, which had tightly packed themselves into awkward ledges and cliffs. It was a wonderful scene, one normally experienced at extremely close quarters by the public. But avian flu led the National Trust last year to close the islands to the public, meaning the birds can now only be seen from the popular sail-round tours offered by local boat operators. Last month the trust announced a repeat of the closure, until August at least, after avian flu was detected in a handful of birds. The fear is that there will be a repeat of last year's devastation which resulted in the removal of 6,000 bird carcasses. The true figure of bird deaths is unquestionably far higher given how many dead birds will have fallen into the sea. It was a traumatic, often miserable year to be a ranger, agreed Tom Hendry, who has been in the job since 2016. 'We're there to look after these birds, to count them and also to share the spectacle with members of the public. So it was very challenging but you just have to focus on the job at hand and how to mitigate the problem as best you can.' A lot of Hendry and his colleagues' days were last year spent in hazmat suits picking up dead birds, triple bagging them and getting them off the islands to go to incinerators. It was a terrible but vital task. 'The more they are lying there, the more risk there is of the disease spreading. It was difficult but for me it was a case of just being in the moment and reflecting about it afterwards. It unfolded so quickly. I think everyone responded differently and was affected differently.' Of the 6,000 carcasses removed last year most were guillemots, kittiwakes and puffins with 3,542, 818 and 467 dead birds collected respectively. The avian flu crisis is a global one. The World Organisation for Animal Health (Woah) said there had been 'an unprecedented number of outbreaks' of bird flu reported in regions across the world since the outbreak began in October 2021. Wild seabirds have been particularly hard hit. The National Trust has been caring for the Farne Islands, home to about 200,000 seabirds annually, for nearly a century. There are no records, the trust said, of anything so potentially damaging to the already endangered colonies. The hope is that making the islands off limits gives the birds a better chance of survival. The islands are also home to one of England's largest grey seal colonies. To see them as well as the birds, the public will have to use companies such as Billy Shiel Farne Island boats, which has been operating trips since 1918. Reid said she was tremendously proud of her team and was optimistic.

{"id": "304", "title": "More than 50,000 wild birds in UK killed by avian flu �ouble previous estimates", "date": "2023-05-05", "fulltext": "H5N1 bird flu may lead to extinction of species as data revealed by Guardian shows worst losses in decades Avian flu has killed more than twice the number of wild birds previously estimated in the UK, according to data collected by the Guardian, with numbers likely to escalate during this year's breeding season. The highly infectious variant of H5N1 has caused Europe's worst bird flu outbreak, resulting in the most significant and sudden loss of birds in decades. Conservationists are warning that it could mean the extinction of some seabird species, as breeding colonies have been particularly badly hit. The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) estimates that 'any more than 20,000' wild birds have died in the UK since the current outbreak began in October 2021. However, the Guardian has studied data from devolved governments and nature organisations that shows the actual figure is at least 50,000 between October 2021 until the start of April 2023. Experts say this number is still likely to be a gross underestimate as there is no national monitoring and most carcasses are never found and not counted. Already this year, there are reports that black-headed gulls, which start nesting in early April before most other seabirds - have been badly hit across the country. According to the RSPB, 1,200 birds have died on their nature reserves in total in 2023, the vast majority of which are black-headed gulls, and there have been early reports of fatalities coming in from Europe. Conservationists at the Wildlife Trust said they had 'never seen mortality this high before' at Yorkshire's largest black-headed gull colony at North Cave Wetlands nature reserve, where 10% of the 2,000 breeding pairs of black-headed gulls have died. However, there are signs they could be over the worst of it. David Craven, regional manager at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, said: 'After an initial spread through the colony, which saw a very rapid rise to 10% mortality, we are now seeing a slowing in the numbers of dead and dying birds, which leads us to hope that this means the disease within the colony is burning itself out.' NatureScot said it had not yet received any reports of mass mortalities among wild birds this year. The Guardian figures show that more than 36,000 birds have died from avian flu in Scotland, with seabirds and waterbirds the worst hit. At least 13,000 Svalbard barnacle geese died in the winter of 2021-22 - a third of the total population. In England, 7,300 deaths were recorded in total, which is divided between two sites off the Northumberland coast - the Farne Islands (an estimated 6,000 deaths) and Coquet Island (1,300 deaths estimated), where rare birds such as arctic terns, black-headed gulls and common terns were among those most affected. Reports from Wales came from a single Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) site - Grassholm, west of Pembrokeshire - where an estimated 5,000 northern gannets died. The UK is home to 60% of the planet's northern gannets, with the population likely to be affected for decades as they are a long-lived species that is slow to reproduce. 'This is the first collation of deaths in all species since the first signs of high mortality in autumn-winter 2021,' said Dr Helen Baker, from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), a public body that advises the UK government. 'It shows both the full extent of spread of the disease across the UK and also that the minimum estimate of losses is higher than early figures.' The data collected by the Guardian focused on major seabird and waterbird breeding and wintering grounds, whereas other species, such as raptors, are more likely to die alone, so it is harder to know the full impact of the disease. The government publishes data on positive tests for avian flu in wild bird carcasses but does not estimate how many birds have died. The data for England and Wales shows there were 1,600 positive tests between October 2021 to March 2023. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: 'We are tackling this outbreak which poses a significant threat to the UK's wild bird populations using the very latest scientific evidence and international best practice.' Separately, Northern Ireland has counted 550 deaths during this outbreak. Prof James Pearce Higgins, director of science at the BTO, said: 'These updated estimates underline the magnitude of impact that avian influenza has had on wild bird populations, particularly the UK's internationally important seabird populations. Ongoing surveys and monitoring at seabird colonies this summer will help us quantify these impacts further, as many infected birds are likely to have died undetected,' he added. In the UK, more than 60 species have been affected by bird flu. Claire Smith, RSPB senior policy officer, described the Guardian's figures as an 'underestimate' and said: 'Sadly, we are not surprised by these figures and it reflects what we saw across our nature reserves last year and what we are seeing worldwide. It is difficult to get absolute numbers for several reasons, including the remoteness of sites, that birds will fall off into the sea and the fact that bird flu monitoring was not well set up for wild birds last year.' She added: 'The outbreak continues this spring as we are seeing positive tests and high numbers of deaths of black-headed gulls in colonies across the Midlands and eastern England. We also have concerns about many raptor species.' The National Trust, which owns the Farne Islands, is already bracing itself for thousands of deaths again this breeding season as seabirds return. Already, three new positive cases of bird flu have been detected on the islands and they have been closed to visitors. Baker said the BTO and JNCC were working towards a fuller assessment of all data for individual species. She added: 'Although this estimate might be slightly higher [than the Guardian figures], it will still be a minimum and it will not be possible to assess the impact for most species until after new counts of nesting birds in seabird colonies are completed over the coming summer.' Since this latest outbreak of avian flu in 2021, 8.3 million poultry birds died or have been culled in the UK, according to Defra.

{"id": "305", "title": "US government is testing avian flu vaccines for birds, but ending the historic outbreak isn't that simple", "date": "2023-05-05", "fulltext": "The United States is facing what some experts are calling 'a new era for bird flu.' Since January 2022, the country has been battling the biggest outbreak yet of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wildlife. The virus is a major threat to commercial and backyard flocks, and it has started to show up in hundreds of mammals, including a handful of pet cats. The risk to humans is low; there has been only one human case of this virus in the US since the outbreak began, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and nine cases globally, mostly among people who work with birds. The CDC says there are trials underway of vaccines that could be used to protect humans in case the virus changes and becomes more of a threat. Separately, the US Department of Agriculture, the US National Poultry Research Center and labs at a handful of American universities have been experimenting with vaccine candidates to be used in birds. The USDA's Agriculture Research Service started trials of four vaccine candidates for animals in April and expects to have initial data on a single-dose vaccine available this month. A two-dose vaccine challenge study -- in which animals are exposed to the virus to see how well the vaccine works -- should produce results in June. If the animal vaccines look to be protective, the USDA's next step would be to work with manufacturers on whether it would be feasible to use them. One manufacturer, Zoetis, announced April 5 the development of a vaccine geared toward currently circulating virus strains. The company says it would take about a year to get to the distribution stage in the US. Vaccines are already available in other countries, including China, Egypt, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico and Vietnam, and some nations are vaccinating their commercial flocks. However, in the United States, not all poultry experts are ready to use a vaccine, even if one becomes available -- at least, not yet. Instead, their focus remains on eradicating the virus. Eradication and vaccination As of April 26, the CDC says, nearly 58.8 million poultry have been affected by avian flu since January 2022. The virus has been detected in at least 6,737 wild birds, and the number is likely to be much higher. There have been poultry outbreaks in 47 states. Although this is the worst outbreak in history, improved biosecurity measures have vastly reduced the number of cases in the commercial sector, according to the USDA. When the outbreak began in early 2022, there were 51 detections among commercial poultry. In March 2023, there were only seven. The USDA says close surveillance work among its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and state and industry partners led to the reduction in cases. Generally, there are two ways of confronting this kind of highly infectious disease in poultry, according to Rodrigo Gallardo, a professor in poultry medicine and a specialist in avian virology at the University of California, Davis. 'One of them is through vaccination action. And then the other one is through eradication,' he said. In the United States, the latter is the approach for now, Gallardo said. If farmers detect even a single case in a flock, they will put down the birds right away. 'The virus keeps replicating and amplifying if the birds are alive, so the only way of stopping the replication and limiting the dissemination is by depopulation,' Gallardo said. Tom Super, the senior vice president for communications for the National Chicken Council, the national trade association for the US broiler chicken industry, said in an email to CNN that although it supports the ongoing discussions about a vaccination program, 'currently we support the eradication policy of APHIS and believe that right now this is the best approach at eliminating [bird flu] in the U.S.' The US Poultry and Egg Association said it's 'certainly a topic of discussion,' but the organization doesn't have a position on implementing a vaccination program. Complications of vaccinations A vaccination program comes with several complications, Gallardo said. Vaccinated birds would be protected, but with this highly infectious disease, they still could shed some virus that could infect unprotected birds. 'So vaccination, in that case, creates amplification if it is not done right,' Gallardo said. Plus, it's difficult to detect the disease in vaccinated birds. Birds that are vaccinated don't always show signs if they're sick, so it would be hard to know what birds to keep separate from the others. Tests also have a hard time telling the difference between antibodies generated by vaccination and antibodies from an infection. 'If you're not able to diagnose it, it might spread more than what it would do if you are able to diagnose it and eradicate it,' Gallardo said. Countries that have chosen the vaccination route see more endemic strains develop, meaning the virus is never really totally wiped out. 'This is a very variable virus, and if you don't update the vaccine that you're applying to meet the change in the virus, then you won't be able to completely protect the birds. Partial protection means more birds will be spreading the virus,' Gallardo said. A vaccine has never been used against highly pathogenic avian influenza in the US, according to the USDA. The agency created a vaccine after an outbreak in 2014 and 2015, but that involved a different strain, so it wouldn't work on the latest version of the virus. The logistics of a vaccine like this are difficult, said Dr. Yuko Sato, an associate professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Iowa State University. 'You have to make sure that the new vaccine will protect against this current virus and hope that it doesn't mutate or change so that the vaccine will continue to be protective,' Sato said. 'The vaccine is not a silver bullet. This is not going to prevent infection of the birds, so in order to have an exit strategy as the country, you would have to make sure that if you vaccinate, if you still have positive birds, you have to be able to make sure that you could stamp out the virus. Otherwise, we'll never be looking at eradicating the virus from the United States.' Vaccines may threaten bird businesses Another concern: Birds are a big business in the US. The US has the largest poultry industry in the world, with 294,000 poultry farms. The market size for chicken and turkey meat production alone for 2023 is projected to generate $57.8 billion, according to market analysis firm IbisWorld. Bird flu has hurt business in the US, but it could do so in a bigger way if the nation vaccinates poultry, according to the National Chicken Council. 'The National Chicken Council does not support the use of a vaccine for [bird flu] for a variety of reasons -- the primary one being trade. Most countries, including the US, do not recognize countries that vaccinate as free of [bird flu] due to concerns that vaccines can mask the presence of the disease. Therefore, they do not accept exports from countries that do vaccinate,' Super wrote in his email. The US broiler industry is the second largest exporter of chicken in the world. It exports about 18% of the chicken meat produced in the United States, valued at more than $5 billion annually. 'If we start vaccinating for [bird flu] in the U.S., the broiler industry will lose our ability to export which will have a significant impact on the industry -- while costing billions and billions of dollars to the U.S. economy every year,' Super said. With the way the disease is spreading, scientists would also probably have to vaccinate wildlife -- which is nearly impossible. Of the birds affected in this outbreak, about 76% are commercial egg-laying hens, 17% are turkeys, and only 5% are broilers, the chickens used for meat, Super said. The rest of the cases have been among ducks, backyard chickens and game birds. 'So the U.S. poultry sector that least needs a vaccine would have the most to risk from using one,' he said.", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "The CDC says there are trials underway of vaccines that could be used to protect humans in case the virus changes and becomes more of a threat.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "'You have to make sure that the new vaccine will protect against this current virus and hope that it doesn't mutate or change so that the vaccine will continue to be protective,' Sato said.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 2, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The virus keeps replicating and amplifying if the birds are alive, so the only way of stopping the replication and limiting the dissemination is by depopulation.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Vaccinated birds would be protected, but with this highly infectious disease, they still could shed some virus that could infect unprotected birds.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "This is a very variable virus, and if you don't update the vaccine that you're applying to meet the change in the virus, then you won't be able to completely protect the birds.

{"id": "306", "title": "21 critically endangered California condors have died from avian flu", "date": "2023-05-06", "fulltext": "A species that conservationists once saved from the brink of extinction is now facing a new powerful threat: avian flu. In a little more than a month, 21 critically endangered California condors have died of avian flu, according to a Friday news release from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The disease has been found in northern Arizona, among the bird's Southwest flock, which straddles the Arizona-Utah border, says the service. Avian flu has not yet been confirmed among any condors in Utah, California, or Baja California, Mexico. The deceased birds, which officials counted from March 30 to May 5, included eight breeding pairs, according to the news release. Four condors with avian flu are currently recovering at Liberty Wildlife, an Arizona wildlife rescue. The deaths have likely set conservation efforts back by a decade or more, the Peregrine Fund, which manages the Southwest flock, told CNN in an email. \"Because the Condor is slow to mature, taking up to eight years before they can produce young, and with an average of one young every other year,\" even a single loss in the wild can have \"a big impact,\" said Chris Parish, the non-profit's president and CEO. \"This will change recovery as we know it.\" \"We will need to double down on causes of mortality that we can control or change rates of, like lead poisoning, and be better prepared with (hopefully) vaccines and greater infrastructure to respond to events like this in the future,\" he went on. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has said it was working to manage the outbreak and may consider vaccinating the endangered birds. The Peregrine Fund added it wasn't sure how influenza entered the condor population. The organization explained that condors are important to preserve because they \"provide a critical ecological service\" by \"eating dead animals that can be a source of disease transmission to other wildlife, livestock, and even humans.\" The species are also considered sacred to the Yurok Tribe, California's largest Native American tribe. The condors, which are one of the world's largest birds with a wingspan of 9.5 feet, almost went extinct in the 1980s, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. By 1987, the tiny population of condors left in the wild was placed into a captive breeding program in an attempt to bring the species back from the brink. In 1992, the service began releasing captive-born condors into the wild. The population has slowly started to bounce back: As of 2020, there were a total of 504 condors in the world with 175 living in captivity and 329 living in the wild, according to a report from the Department of the Interior. But they still face serious threats, including lead poisoning, which the birds contract after scavenging on animals that have been shot with lead ammunition. Experts have said this may be one of the deadliest outbreaks of avian flu ever in the US. The disease has affected almost 60,000 captive poultry across 47 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

{"id": "307", "title": "California condors confront bird flu in flight from extinction", "date": "2023-05-12", "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The California condor is facing the deadliest strain of avian influenza in U.S. history, and the outbreak could jeopardize the iconic vulture with its 10-foot (3.05-meter) wingspan decades after conservationists saved the species from extinction. But nine newly hatched chicks, covered in downy white feathers, give condor-keepers at the Los Angeles Zoo hope that the endangered population of North America's largest soaring land birds will once again thrive after 40 years of aggressive efforts. With fewer than 350 condors in the wild — in flocks that span from the Pacific Northwest to Baja California, Mexico — the historic outbreak means ongoing breeding-in-captivity and re-wilding programs like the LA Zoo's remain essential. Over the past year and a half, millions of birds across the U.S. have died from avian flu, including more than 430 bald eagles and some 58 million turkeys and commercial chickens that were euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease. Bird flu is further suspected in the deaths of dozens of seals off the coast of Maine last summer. Already, the strain is believed to have caused the deaths of at least 22 California condors in Arizona, which were part of a flock in the Southwest that typically accounts for a third of the species' entire wild population. Experts are now concerned the strain could further impact condors by rapidly spreading across state lines through the spring migration. More than two dozen environmental advocates this week urged the federal government to expedite approvals for a vaccine that would be given to both condors in the wild and in captivity. The advocates, which include the Center for Biological Diversity, warned in a letter that the flu strain is 'jeopardizing the existence' of the famed bird. 'The California condor is at risk of extinction once again, and once again, an emergency vaccination campaign is required to stave off a deadly infection and possible extinction,' they wrote, referencing the success of the West Nile Virus vaccine for condors in the early 2000s. As the 50th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act approaches, wildlife officials say the species still cannot sustain itself without human intervention — even though humans are also to blame for much of its losses outside the avian flu, including deaths from lead ammunition poisoning. 'I think it's going to take some changes in behavior from the humans on the planet so that we can really address the threats to the species,' said Ashleigh Blackford, the California condor coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Despite a California law banning it for hunting, lead ammunition is still readily used. The condors scavenge meat from dead animals, felled by the lead ammunition, and fall ill — often fatally. 'It's really hard to watch a bird you raised come back and die in your arms,' said Los Angeles Zoo condor-keeper Chandra David, who has tended to lead-poisoned condors brought back to the zoo for treatment. 'And there's nothing we can do about it.' Still, spring is a time for hope. At breeding programs in the U.S. and Mexico, chicks are hatching and online 'condor cams' provide live feeds for fans. 'It's a funny species in that it really is not your typical charismatic species, right? They are a little bit on the ugly side. Most people are not endeared to vultures, but this one in particular (is different),' Blackford said. Regardless, the condor looms large in California culture — even if it's not the official state bird (that's the California quail). The mascot for the Los Angeles Clippers is Chuck the Condor and one of the birds in flight is featured prominently on the state quarter. The population was nearly wiped out by hunting during the California Gold Rush, as well as poisoning from toxic pesticide DDT and lead ammunition. In the 1980s, all 22 California condors left in the wild were controversially captured and put into captive breeding programs to save the species. Zoo-bred birds were first released into the wild in 1992 and in the years since have been reintroduced into habitats they'd disappeared from — including the Yurok Tribe's ancestral lands in Northern California. The ongoing re-wilding efforts are considered a conservation success. 'It took decades to drive species toward extinction and it's, in many cases, going to take decades to bring them back,' said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director for Center for Biological Diversity. The condor is intrinsically tied to several Native American tribes in the West. The Havasupai people, for example, say the condor flew their ancestors from the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the top -- its wings creating the famous striations. For the Yurok Tribe, the work to bring the condors back highlights how Native Americans are reclaiming their traditional roles as stewards of the land — which was a role that was taken from us forcibly post-contact,' said Tiana Williams-Claussen, director of the tribe's wildlife department. Known as prey-go-neesh in Yurok, the revered condor disappeared from the region in the late 1800s. In 2021, Williams-Claussen and her team, building on a promise made by tribal leaders in 2003, watched as captive-bred condors took flight over Yurok lands for the first time in more than a century. The tribe hopes to release four to six captive-bred birds into the wild annually over the next two decades. 'Ultimately our goal, of course, is to have birds without tags, without transmitters, that can just reintegrate into our ecosystem,' Williams-Claussen said, 'into our cultural lifeways again.'

{"id": "308", "title": "Bird flu could become the next human pandemic �nd politicians aren� paying attention", "date": "2023-05-16", "fulltext": "We have the tools to prepare, but post-Covid fatigue and a lack of political will mean they aren't being used. Last month a pet dog in Canada died of H5N1, also known as bird flu, after eating a wild goose. Worryingly this follows a pattern, with an increasing number of bird flu cases appearing in mammals who come into contact with an infected bird, dead or alive. When you see a wild bird such as a duck or seagull, think bird flu. Because it's actually more likely than not they're infected with the virus. And many species of wild birds are asymptomatic, meaning that they don't show any symptoms. The risk of transmission to pets is low, but they can get sick from chewing or eating an infected bird, whether it's dead or alive. I first wrote about bird flu in November, when domestic birds in Britain were put into an indoor lockdown. The virus had become endemic in most wild bird populations. It's incredibly infectious, where one bird could infect as many as 100 others. When infected wild birds encountered domestic birds (such as by flying over and defecating on them underneath), huge problems emerged. Avian flu has a near 100% fatality rate in most poultry, which led to shortages of not only turkey for Christmas but also eggs, as farm after farm was decimated by the disease. Since November, the signals emerging across the world continue to be worrying. In January and February this year, more than 3,000 sea lions died of bird flu in Peru (where the death toll in wild birds reached an estimated 50,000). In Russia, 700 Caspian seals died. Then several dolphins in Britain and the US died of H5N1. Normally, even if an animal catches H5N1 from a bird, it can't pass it to other mammals. This limits its spread. But the large number of cases in these outbreaks suggest the possibility of mammal-to-mammal transmission, although this hasn't been confirmed yet by genetic sequencing. A more likely hypothesis is that these outbreaks are groups of animals feeding on infected birds. It is not yet 100% clear what's happening. But the risk of spread among mammals is ever-present. A new research pre-print from Canada showed that H5N1 samples could spread efficiently between ferrets with fatal outcomes. In order to spread efficiently to humans, H5 would need three major categories of genetic changes, according to bird flu expert Prof Richard Webby. So far, the virus has been able to make one of these changes, but not the other two. So right now, H5N1 is a theoretical risk for the next human pandemic, rather than one requiring urgency in response today. And a prime minister or health secretary might say, 'Why prepare for something that might never happen?' To those of us scientists working in global health, there are enough concerning signals that action should already be happening. So that if a certain set of mutations do occur and we see an outbreak in humans in Peru or China or Britain, that the harm it could cause is minimal. This is a disease with an estimated 50-60% fatality rate in humans, including children. The cornerstone of infectious disease preparedness is in: surveillance (to know what strain is spreading and where in birds); testing (to identify disease quickly in humans); vaccines (for protection against disease and death); and antivirals (to improve clinical outcomes). The US government is already moving in this direction. Rebecca Katz, professor at Georgetown University Medical Center, has noted that a H5 candidate vaccine virus recently produced by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is likely to provide good protection against the circulating H5N1 viruses. The information has been shared with vaccine manufacturers to start the process of stockpiling adequate doses. But this is a challenge because most influenza vaccines are created by incubating doses in chicken eggs (called egg-based production). If bird flu has killed off many of the chickens, then egg shortages are likely. There's another H5N1 vaccine which is non-egg based, but they could have a maximum of 150m doses ready within six months. The world's population is almost 8 billion. In addition, the FDA-approved antiviral treatments for seasonal influenza could also work against bird flu. But again, getting doses to all parts of the world is a challenge given shortages. Preparation must also involve appropriate PPE for healthcare workers to protect against a respiratory disease (flu) and diagnostics to quickly identify if someone is infectious in hospitals. All of these issues are solvable with precise planning, collaboration across countries, scientific ingenuity and good leadership. With post Covid-19 fatigue, the bigger problem is bringing the public along and communicating the facts so that they are trusted and believed. With so much often understandable distrust in our current political leadership, authorities like chief medical officers and independent government advisers become crucial. At the moment most governments aren't paying attention to bird flu: they're more interested in another AI (artificial intelligence) rather than this AI (avian influenza), but the avian influenza threat is real, and needs much more immediate attention and preparation. * Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "The article mentions an estimated 50-60% fatality rate in humans but does not provide any nuances questioning the accuracy of this rate.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "But the large number of cases in these outbreaks suggest the possibility of mammal-to-mammal transmission, although this hasn't been confirmed yet by genetic sequencing.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "But the risk of spread among mammals is ever-present.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_5": "So right now, H5N1 is a theoretical risk for the next human pandemic, rather than one requiring urgency in response today.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_6": "So that if a certain set of mutations do occur and we see an outbreak in humans in Peru or China or Britain, that the harm it could cause is minimal.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 4, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The large number of cases in these outbreaks suggest the possibility of mammal-to-mammal transmission, although this hasn't been confirmed yet by genetic sequencing.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "A new research pre-print from Canada showed that H5N1 samples could spread efficiently between ferrets with fatal outcomes.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "In order to spread efficiently to humans, H5 would need three major categories of genetic changes, according to bird flu expert Prof Richard Webby.

The two are the first humans to test positive for the virus in the U.K. since the agency announced a case of a 79-year-old English man who was infected after allowing ducks into his home. The agency said bird-to-human transmission of avian flu had occurred in the U.K. only a small number of times prior to that January 2022 infection. The poultry workers who tested positive for the H5 strain were believed to have been exposed to sick birds while working at the same farm, which was not identified. Poultry farms were under order from November until mid-April to keep all birds indoors after avian flu was discovered on dozens of farms. Since October 2021, the U.K. has faced its worst outbreak of avian influenza, with hundreds of cases confirmed and millions of birds culled. The positive tests were detected through screening of poultry workers exposed to infected birds. The two workers have since tested negative. Precautionary contact tracing was being done, the agency said. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the agency, said the level of risk to human health from bird flu was very low in the general population. \"Current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we're seeing circulating in birds around the world do not spread easily to people,\" Hopkins said. \"Globally, there is no evidence of spread of this strain from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population.\"", "media_outlet": "AP", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Globally, there is no evidence of spread of this strain from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population.", "affirm_why_count": 1, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_2": "Globally, there is no evidence of spread of this strain from person to person.", "deny_transmissible_count": 1, "deny_why_statement_1": "Current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we're seeing circulating in birds around the world do not spread easily to people.", "deny_why_count": 1, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service granted emergency approval for use of the vaccine after more than a dozen condors recently died from the bird flu, known as H5N1. There are fewer than 350 California condors in the wild, in flocks that span from the Pacific Northwest to Baja California, Mexico. A pilot safety study will begin this month in North American vultures, a similar species, allowing investigators to check for any adverse effects before they give vaccines to the endangered condors, according to an agriculture department statement. The department approved the emergency vaccination \"because these birds are critically endangered, closely monitored, and their population is very small which allows close monitoring of the vaccine,\" the statement said. Over the past year and a half, millions of birds across the U.S. have died from avian flu, including more than 430 bald eagles and some 58 million turkeys and commercial chickens that were euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease. California's population of iconic condors, with their 10-foot (3-meter) wingspans, was nearly wiped out by hunting during the California Gold Rush, as well as by poisoning from toxic pesticide DDT and ingesting lead ammunition.

{"id": "311", "title": "Bird Flu Vaccine Authorized for Emergency Use in California Condors", "date": "2023-05-16", "fulltext": "Federal officials have granted emergency approval to a bird flu vaccine for use in California condors, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on Tuesday. The move comes after more than a dozen of the birds, which are critically endangered, recently died from the virus, known as H5N1. Worldwide, there are fewer than 600 California condors, which can have wingspans of nearly 10 feet. The emergency approval is an attempt to prevent additional deaths of these birds, said the agency, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The vaccine was initially developed for a different version of avian influenza, and the condors will not begin receiving it right away. Three federal agencies—the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey—are now working together to test the vaccine in black vultures, a species related to California condors. Twenty vultures in North Carolina received the shots on Tuesday, the agencies said in a joint email. If the results are promising, the next step will be to vaccinate 25 captive condors, they said. Why It Matters: Condors are at high risk. The virus was first detected in a California condor found dead in late March. Since then, 20 more condors have died and four additional condors are currently in rehabilitation facilities, according to the federal agency. The virus has been confirmed in 15 of those birds. Condors appear to be highly susceptible to the virus, said Dr. Carlos Sanchez, the head veterinarian at the Oregon Zoo, which has a condor breeding program. Once they get it, he said, they tend to have high mortality. California condor populations dropped precipitously during the 20th century; in the 1980s, fewer than 30 birds were left. In the decades since, captive breeding programs have helped the population recover. If the virus gets into more condor populations, it could erase this progress, Dr. Sanchez said: We're talking about a potential catastrophic collapse of the conservation project. Background: A new version of an old threat. The H5N1 virus was first detected in China in 1996. Since then, various versions of the virus have circulated in wild birds and caused repeated outbreaks in poultry. A new version of the virus arrived in North America in late 2021. Since then, it has spread rapidly throughout the United States, causing the largest bird flu outbreak in the nation's history and resulting in the death of almost 60 million farmed birds. It has also taken a far heavier toll on wild birds than previous outbreaks. It has been detected in more than 6,700 wild birds—a figure that is surely an underestimate—in every state but Hawaii and has resulted in mass die-offs of wild birds around the world. It has also repeatedly spilled over into mammals and caused a small number of human infections, generally in people who were known to have been in close contact with birds. The virus is best adapted to birds, and the threat to the general public remains low, officials say. But scientists have long been concerned that the virus could evolve in ways that help it spread easily among people. What's next: Officials are considering a broader bird vaccination campaign. The small size of the existing California condor population will allow the vaccination program to be monitored closely, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said. Federal officials have not authorized the vaccine for use in other birds. But the size and scope of the current outbreak have prompted officials to consider a mass poultry vaccination campaign. U.S.D.A. scientists have been testing numerous potential poultry vaccines and have said that some results could be available this spring. The country could see more animal outbreaks in the coming weeks as infected wild birds migrate north for the summer.

Two poultry workers have tested positive for bird flu after coming into contact with infected birds on the same farm in England, according to the UK Health Security Agency. The cases were picked up through a screening programme for people who have come into close contact with the virus, though neither individual suffered symptoms and both have since tested negative. Health officials said there were no signs of person-to-person transmission of the virus, which has spread dramatically in wild bird populations and affected other species, but added that contact tracing was being carried out for one of the workers as a precaution. Current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we're seeing circulating in birds around the world do not spread easily to people, said Prof Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at UKHSA. However, we know already that the virus can spread to people following close contact with infected birds and this is why, through screening programmes like this one, we are monitoring people who have been exposed, to learn more about this risk. Based on the timing of the poultry workers' exposure and their test results, the UKHSA said it believed one of the cases was not infected with avian flu, but had inhaled virus-containing material into their nose and throat that triggered a positive result on a nasal swab. In the second case, health officials have not ruled out an infection with the virus, though, as with the first case, the person may have inhaled virus that did not establish itself as an infection. The UKHSA said that person was the focus of an ongoing investigation and that precautionary contact tracing was undertaken. Both cases are thought to relate to the H5N1 strain of avian flu. The two cases are the latest since January 2022 when a person living in the south-west of England was found to be infected with avian influenza. The UKHSA found no evidence of onward transmission from the infected individual. The agency said the two new cases did not change the level of risk to human health, which remains very low for the general population. Globally there is no evidence of spread of this strain from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population, said Hopkins. It remains critical that people avoid touching sick or dead birds, and that they follow the Defra advice about reporting. Health protection teams at the UKHSA make daily contact with individuals who are at high risk of exposure to avian flu to ask about any symptoms they may be experiencing. The latest two cases were detected through the agency's asymptomatic surveillance programme, where poultry workers are asked to take nose and throat swabs which are tested for the virus for 10 days after exposure. Some workers are also asked to provide finger prick blood tests which the UKHSA checks for antibodies against avian influenza, which would point to an infection that has triggered the body's immune defences.

For years, wildlife conservationists have been working to save the bird and have brought it from the brink of extinction, but more than a dozen condors in the US have been killed in the latest outbreak of bird flu, setting the conservation efforts back by a decade or more, experts said. The US Fish and Wildlife Service asked APHIS about the possibility of vaccination after a California condor was found dead in late March, the USDA said Tuesday. APHIS granted the emergency approval since the birds are 'critically endangered, closely monitored, and their population is very small which allows close monitoring of the vaccine to ensure it is administered only to the approved population,' it said in a statement. A vaccine has never been used against highly pathogenic avian influenza in the US, according to the USDA. This vaccine is a killed inactivated product that was conditionally licensed by APHIS in 2016. It is unclear when vaccinations will start. Because the vaccine has not been tested in this species or against this strain of the virus, the US Fish and Wildlife Service will fund a pilot program to test its safety in North American vultures, a similar species, in North Carolina this month. As of May 5, all confirmed bird flu cases in California condors have been found in northern Arizona. There have not been cases confirmed in the condor populations in Utah, California or Mexico, according to US Fish and Wildlife. Globally, there are just over 500 California condors left, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. The vaccine emergency authorization is limited to California condors. The USDA and a handful of universities have been working on a vaccine that could possibly be used in poultry if a vaccine is considered necessary. A vaccination program for other birds would come with several complications. Birds that are vaccinated could still shed some virus that could infect unprotected birds, logistics are difficult, and for poultry, it would be difficult to sell birds overseas because most countries will not accept exports from countries that vaccinate. For now, most poultry experts prefer to control the disease with close surveillance and eliminating birds that are sick. This is the worst avian flu outbreak in the US, but improved biosecurity has reduced the number of detections in the commercial bird industry compared with previous outbreaks, the USDA said. Still, nearly 58.8 million poultry have been affected, and bird flu has been detected in more than 6,800 wild birds and dozens of since January 2022, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

{"id": "314", "title": "RSPB calls for suspension of game-bird releases over avian flu fears", "date": "2023-05-18", "fulltext": "Charity says stocking countryside for shooting season would be catastrophic with disease still a major threat to wild birds. The RSPB is calling for a moratorium on the release of game birds this summer to keep avian flu levels down. The charity says it will be catastrophic for tens of millions of game birds such as pheasants and partridges to be released in late June and July for shooting in the summer and autumn with avian flu still a huge threat to wild birds. There have been 10 outbreaks of avian flu at game-bird rearing premises since 2021. The most recent was in April at Bettws Hall Game Farm, a major facility near Newtown in Powys where protection zones are still in place. Game birds are held in captivity in the UK before they are released for the shooting season. The Animal and Plant Health Agency classifies the birds as poultry while in captivity, but once released they are classed as wild birds for avian flu rules, and their breeder or owner is no longer their legal keeper. About 55 million pheasants and red-legged partridges and 2.6 million mallards are reared in captivity each year for release into the countryside to be shot for sport. Bird releases start towards the end of June and continue through July and August, but before then they can be moved from farms to release pens which are often unroofed. This can lead to interactions with wild birds, putting them at risk, the RSPB says. The Welsh government's chief veterinary officer, Dr. Richard Irvine, announced the latest protection zone around Bettws Hall Game Farm on 27 April. Under the declaration game birds are not allowed to be released. The chair of the National Farmers Union in Montgomeryshire, Richard Jones, said it must be enforced and that no birds should be released from the farm this season. He said releases would put thousands of birds, including poultry, at risk. Jones, whose farm is within the six-mile (10km) protection zone around Bettws Hall, still has to keep his poultry, which is supposed to be free range, indoors. He is awaiting the arrival of 21,000 new birds at the beginning of June. The release of pheasants and game birds will hugely increase the risk to my birds. Once they are released, they are wild birds and will mix with other wild birds with avian flu. It will become a humungous problem. Meanwhile we are not allowed to release our birds outdoors because we are in the restriction zone. The RSPB says there should be a ban on bird releases to stop the catastrophic spread of avian flu. The charity said it was not clear how many pheasants and other game birds were tested for diseases before being released for the shooting season. Two people have tested positive for bird flu, the UK Health Security Agency said on Tuesday. They are known to have worked on an infected poultry farm in England recently, and neither has experienced any symptoms of the disease. They were detected in a testing programme carried out by the UKHSA on poultry workers. Both have since tested negative.

{"id": "315", "title": "Avian flu vaccine for California condors approved amid fears of extinction", "date": "2023-05-22", "fulltext": "Vaccine gets emergency approval as 'highly contagious' virus sweeps through flocks of species on the brink of extinction A new vaccine has been granted emergency approval to protect California condors from a deadly strain of avian influenza, federal officials said this week, amid attempts to pull the endangered species back from the brink of extinction. The emergency action underscores an outbreak that has alarmed the conservation community, which fears that condors, a vulnerable species that has spent decades in recovery, could be dealt a devastating blow. After first being detected in a deceased condor in late March, the illness has swept through the small flock of wild birds, which are closely monitored by agencies in the south-west. So far 21 condors have died, impacting eight breeding pairs, according to a statement issued by the US Fish and Wildlife service. The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or HPAI, is a virus that has been described as 'highly contagious' by the agency. An April statement confirming deaths of the first infected condors in early April said the virus can spread quickly through 'bird-to-bird contact, environmental contamination with fecal material, and via exposed clothing, shoes and vehicles.' Several condors remain in the care of experts, including a newly hatched chick whose egg was pulled from its contaminated nest before its mother succumbed to the disease. Officials and rescue workers remain hopeful that the orphaned baby, now being nurtured with the help of a plush condor at the Liberty Wildlife facility in Phoenix, Arizona, can soon be returned to the wild. For now the chick is nestled among blankets and its stuffed surrogate, awaiting placement with foster parents at the Peregrine Fund's captive breeding facility. Despite it being limited to one flock in Arizona, conservation groups are concerned that the deadly illness has already taken a devastating toll on the delicate condor population. 'In a matter of weeks, this event has set our recovery effort back a decade or more,' the Peregrine Fund, an organization dedicated to protecting birds of prey and a key federal partner in restoring and rehabilitating California condors to the wild, wrote in a late-April update on the HPAI impact on condors, adding that the new threat posed by avian flu 'highlights the need to address preventable and manageable threats, and rely even more heavily on proven strategies such as captive breeding to increase the wild population.' Once abundant in the skies across their western range, which spans from the Pacific north-west to Baja California, Mexico, only a few hundred of these iconic and enormous vultures remain in the wild even after decades of dedicated breeding and conservation efforts. The fast-spreading disease is one of several threats condors have faced since populations were first decimated by hunting during the California gold rush, including dangers posed by the toxic DDT pesticide and lead poisoning from ammunition lodged in scavenged carcasses. Recovery has been slow. Condors don't mate until they reach maturity at around eight years old, and females only produce a single egg every two years. This dangerous strain of avian flu has rapidly spread across the US, killing millions of domestic and wild birds since it arrived in North America at the end of 2021. Though the virus is not considered a high risk to humans, it's been among the most devastating outbreaks for birds in the country's history. Roughly 58 million commercial poultry have had to be euthanized in attempts to slow the spread of the disease, which has also claimed the lives of hundreds of bald eagles and been detected in more than 6,700 wild birds, a figure widely considered to be underestimated. While the emergency-use approval by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is limited to California condors, the agency is continuing work to develop options for other types of birds. Before administering it to condors, a pilot study has been initiated to test the vaccine on North American vultures — similar species — to ensure there are no adverse effects. 'APHIS approved this emergency vaccination of the condors because these birds are critically endangered, closely monitored, and their population is very small which allows close monitoring of the vaccine to ensure it is administered only to the approved population,' the agency said in a statement issued on Tuesday. Along with the hopeful announcement that a vaccine may soon be ready to administer, efforts to isolate infected birds have been successful. Infections among the Arizona flock where the virus was found are holding steady. 'Our field teams have not detected any additional compromised California condors in northern Arizona since April 11,' the Peregrine Fund posted in an update this week, adding that four birds under its care are showing signs of recovery. 'The Peregrine Fund's captive breeding program is also in full swing, and new life is hatching,' it added. 'Of 18 eggs laid, nine young have hatched and a new season for the recovery effort begins.'

Brazil, the world's biggest chicken meat exporter with US$9.7bn in sales in 2022, has so far confirmed eight cases of the H5N1 in wild birds, including seven in Espirito Santo state and one in Rio de Janeiro state. The agriculture ministry said on Monday that it had created an emergency operations centre to coordinate, plan and evaluate national actions related to avian influenza. H5N1 infection in wild birds does not trigger trade bans, based on guidelines of the World Organization for Animal Health. However, a case of bird flu on a farm usually results in the entire flock being killed and can trigger trade restrictions from importing countries. Though Brazil's main meat producing states are in the south, the government is on alert after the confirmed cases, as avian flu in wild birds has been followed by transmission to commercial flocks in some countries. Shares in Brazil-based BRF SA, the world's biggest chicken exporter, were up 3.6% before the government announcement, but ended the day 0.5% lower. Over the weekend, the health ministry said samples of 33 suspected cases of avian influenza in humans in Espirito Santo, where Brazil confirmed the first cases in wild birds last week, all came back negative.

{"id": "317", "title": "US will vaccinate birds against avian flu for first time � what researchers think", "date": "2023-05-26", "fulltext": "US officials have authorized the vaccination of the critically endangered California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) against a type of avian flu spreading globally. It is the first time that the United States has approved inoculation of any bird against highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The authorization comes as an H5N1 strain of avian influenza, a type of HPAI, has spread to an unprecedented number of countries, lasted longer than a typical outbreak and killed hundreds of millions of birds, as well as many mammals, worldwide. Some countries already vaccinate birds, including commercial flocks, against avian flu. The severity of the outbreak is driving some nations that have been hesitant, including the United States, to follow suit. The decision to vaccinate California condors, a closely monitored species, does not mean that authorities are planning to vaccinate the country's poultry stock. Still, researchers will be watching how the inoculation campaign goes, with an eye towards administering the vaccines more widely. 'This authorization opens the opportunity to add another tool for how we address this threat,' says Ashleigh Blackford, the California-condor coordinator at the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), headquartered in Washington DC. Persistent flare-ups The strain of HPAI that is currently spreading first infected birds in China in 1996 and has since caused sporadic outbreaks that usually flare up in the autumn and fizzle out by the following spring. But since late 2021, outbreaks have persisted through the summer in a record number of bird species, along with mammals such as raccoons, foxes and seals. H5N1 has killed birds before, but 'never to the extent we're seeing in North America and Europe now' says Samantha Gibbs, a wildlife veterinarian at the FWS, who specializes in avian influenza. Since October 2021, more than 70 countries on five continents have reported outbreaks. And on 22 May, Brazil, which is the world's largest poultry exporter, became the eighth South American country to declare an emergency, in response to the country's first detection of HPAI in wild birds. H5N1 can infect people, but cases are rare and typically involve close contact with infected poultry. No documented cases of human-to-human transmission of this strain of the virus have occurred thus far, but researchers worry that, with more opportunities to infect mammals, the virus could eventually evolve the ability to spread among people. Condor conservation Several vaccines against H5N1 are available, but administering the jab to birds has long been controversial among researchers and farmers. Poultry producers worry about the cost and difficulty of vaccinating millions of birds, as well as trade restrictions: many countries forbid the import of vaccinated birds owing to concerns that they could make it difficult to track the virus's spread. Avian flu freezes coastal bird research in South Africa Until this outbreak, US authorities had claimed that strict biosafety protocols, such as enhanced disinfection procedures for farm workers or wildlife managers, and culling infected birds were enough to mitigate the worst effects of HPAI. The high mortality rate of the current strain of H5N1 in the California condor, which is the largest bird in North America, has forced health officials to re-evaluate this approach. The species had a brush with extinction in 1987: only 27 wild condors remained at that time, so US officials captured them, bred them in captivity and released them back into the wild. Today, the birds remain one of the world's rarest avian species: as of last year, there were 537 condors, and 63% of them lived in the wild. So far this year, officials have found 21 dead condors, 15 of which tested positive for HPAI. (The bodies of four birds couldn't be recovered, so their HPAI status is unknown.) It took more than 20 years to rebuild the population to its current level, Blackford says. 'This is not the direction we want to be going in.' Inoculating these birds is a 'perfect use of the vaccine,' says Karen Grogan, a clinical poultry veterinarian at the University of Georgia in Athens. But it's unclear whether it will be effective in the condors, because it was licensed for use in chickens. 'Even between chickens and turkeys, which are a part of the same family of birds, a vaccination might be efficacious in one but not the other' she says. Last week, scientists gave the jab to 20 black vultures (Coragyps atratus), which are part of the same family as the condors but are not endangered, to test the vaccine's safety and efficacy. They will also vaccinate captive California condors before inoculating the wild population during an annual routine health check, Blackford says. The jabs use an inactivated form of an earlier H5N1 strain. Stop the spread This limited vaccination campaign in the United States is just one part of a broader movement among researchers to study the safety and efficacy of vaccination against avian influenza in birds. The objective for the condor programme is to conserve an endangered species, says Jean-Luc Guérin, an avian pathologist at the National Veterinary School of Toulouse, France. In other regions, there are aims to curb the spread of the virus altogether. For example, the French government has ordered 80 million HPAI jabs as part of a mass-vaccination campaign for the country's poultry stocks, starting with ducks. This campaign, the first of its kind in the European Union, is due to start in September. China, meanwhile, has been vaccinating its poultry stock for nearly 20 years and has had some success in reducing infections in poultry and people. Although the US Department of Agriculture is testing four vaccine candidates against H5N1 for use in poultry, it has not signalled that it plans to deploy a wider vaccination campaign for commercially farmed birds. Gibbs says that, although vaccinations can be an important tool to keep outbreaks in check, the fundamentals of conservation work will be even more important to protect the health of wildlife, and ultimately of people. Efforts to preserve and restore bird habitats will ensure that animals 'can fight off not just bird flu, but whatever is going to come next' Gibbs says. 'If we set them up for success through conservation efforts, then we don't have to play this catch-up game with pharmaceuticals.' References 1. Wu J. et al. Emerg. Infect.

{"id": "318", "title": "Eggs Are Going on Sale Just Months After Prices Hit Records; Supply bounces back from avian influenza hardship", "date": "2023-06-04", "fulltext": "Get ready for the surprise supermarket deal of the summer: eggs. Retail egg prices are on track to return to historic averages in the coming months, supermarket executives said, after the deadliest avian influenza outbreak in U.S. history helped push prices above $4 a dozen in January. Now, egg supplies have bounced back, industry officials and farmers say, as the disease's spread has slowed and flocks of laying hens have been rebuilt. At supermarket chains such as New York-based Tops Markets, shoppers recently saw eggs on sale for the first time in months. 'Prices should all be under $2 a dozen,' said Sue Durfee, who oversees eggs, dairy and other items at Tops. 'We plan on trying to promote them once or twice a month.' The company recently offered eggs at a discounted $1.49 a dozen, and plans to run sales at $1.29 in the coming months, she said, after not giving discounts on eggs in more than a year. Eggs became one of the most striking examples of U.S. food inflation in late 2022 as prices surged more than 30% last year, outpacing all other grocery items, according to market research firm Circana Group. Consumers bought fewer eggs and tested egg substitutes such as chickpea liquid and avocado. Some began raising their own chickens. Michael Colombo, an employee at an insurance brokerage firm in Staten Island, said he had cut back on eggs in recent months to save money. For breakfast, he swapped in avocado toast or eggless pancakes in place of his favorite, hard-boiled eggs. Recently, Colombo purchased two dozen eggs for $3 at a local grocery shop. He said he has been telling everyone about the discounts and planned to resume making hard-boiled and deviled eggs. Supermarket executives and egg companies attributed the price surge to the spread of highly pathogenic avian flu, which has killed about 59 million birds in the U.S. since February 2022. The outbreak cut U.S. egg inventories by 29% in the final week of December, compared with the beginning of 2022, according to the USDA, and prompted farmers and egg companies to spend millions of dollars on measures to prevent the virus' spread. Some grocers said they lost money on eggs over the past year as they kept prices low to stay competitive. Many supermarkets avoided discounting eggs because they didn't want to run out, and some operators set purchase limits. New cases of bird flu have waned over the past few months. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported two cases in commercial farms in April, compared with 106 in April 2022. Meanwhile, flocks have been rebuilt. The USDA estimated the total egg-laying hen population in the U.S. was up 5% in May compared with the prior year, and 1% higher than the previous month. After peaking in December, wholesale prices of Midwest large eggs were $1.28 a dozen last week, according to research firm Urner Barry. Average retail prices were $2.70 a dozen at the end of April, according to the most recent available data from research firm NIQ, compared with a five-year high of more than $4 in January and below $2 before the bird flu affected inventory. Retail prices typically lag behind wholesale prices, said Keith Bollman, senior director of commodities at Topco Associates, a cooperative of more than 40 food companies, including Wegmans Food Markets. Grocers might sell existing inventory purchased at locked-in prices or seek to recoup lost profit margins. For egg farmers, the rapid price drop has squeezed profits, while protecting flocks from infection has added new expenses. 'It's cratered the market,' said Glenn Hickman, chief executive of Hickman's Egg Ranch in Arizona. 'Everybody in the egg business is losing money.' Agriculture industry officials said chickens and the egg market remain at risk of a bird flu rebound. John Clifford, a former U.S. chief veterinary officer, said the recent drop in cases could be attributed to influenza-carrying wild birds building up immunity, reduced migration activity or just plain luck. 'We'll see what happens in the fall with migration,' said Clifford, who oversaw a 2015 avian flu outbreak that killed about 50 million birds. Grocery executives said they are hopeful that lower egg prices are here to stay, but remain on guard for further outbreaks that might again upend the market. 'I assume things will get back to some type of normalcy,' said Mike Morrison, store manager of Warren's Plaza IGA in Marietta, Ohio, where four dozen eggs were selling for $5 recently.

{"id": "319", "title": "For These Bird Flu Researchers, Work Is a Day at the Very �cky�each", "date": "2023-06-04", "fulltext": "The H5N1 virus poses a great unknown threat to birds and humans alike. Understanding and thwarting it begins with excrement collection. It was a glorious day for field work on the shores of the Delaware Bay. The late afternoon sun cast a warm glow over the gently sloping beach. The receding tide revealed a smattering of shells. The dune grasses rustled in the breeze. The beach vines were in bloom. And the bird droppings were fresh and plentiful. 'Here's one,' said Pamela McKenzie, a researcher at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, pointing a gloved finger at one tiny white splotch and then another. 'Here's one, there's one, there's one.' For the next two hours, Dr. McKenzie and her colleagues crept along the shore, scooping up avian excrement. Their goal: to stay a step ahead of bird flu, a group of avian-adapted viruses that experts have long worried could evolve to spread easily among humans and potentially set off the next pandemic. Every spring, this part of southern New Jersey becomes a bird-flu hot spot. Shorebirds winging their way north alight on local beaches to rest and refuel, excreting virus along the way. And every year for the last four decades, scientists from St. Jude have flown into town to pick up after them. The work requires patience — waiting for the movements of the birds and the movements of the tides to align — keen eyes and resilient knees, sturdy enough to withstand hours of shuffling and squatting along the sometimes rugged shorelines. 'They're not nice, sandy beaches,' said Lisa Kercher, a member of the St. Jude team. 'They're thick, muddy, icky beaches that are full of bird poop.' But these dropping-covered shores are helping scientists learn more about how avian influenza evolves, how it behaves in the wild and what it might take for these bird viruses to become a global public health threat. These scientific questions, which have driven the St. Jude team for decades, have become even more urgent as the United States grapples with its largest bird flu outbreak in history, caused by a new, highly pathogenic version of a virus known as H5N1. 'Delaware Bay has turned into an influenza gold mine,' said Robert Webster, the St. Jude influenza expert who first discovered the hot spot in 1985. He has been back, or his colleagues have, every year since. 'And we will continue to mine that gold mine until we've found the answers.' Beaches for the birds In June, the southern New Jersey shore fills up with vacationing families, their colorful beach umbrellas sprouting up across the sand. But in May, the beaches belong to the birds. Hundreds of thousands of migrating shorebirds and gulls make pit stops here en route to their summer breeding grounds, some arriving, bedraggled and depleted, after days-long journeys from South America. 'They're in a desperate need to replenish their weight,' said Lawrence Niles, a wildlife biologist who leads local shorebird conservation projects through his company, Wildlife Restoration Projects. Fortunately, the birds arrive just as hordes of horseshoe crabs are hauling themselves up onto shore, laying eggs by the thousands. The birds might spend two weeks gorging on the gelatinous green eggs, 'almost doubling their body weight,' Dr. Niles said. During that time, they blanket the beaches, mingle with local birds and, like children in an overcrowded classroom, give each other the flu. Wild water birds — including ducks, gulls and shorebirds — are the natural reservoirs for influenza A viruses, which come in a variety of subtypes. Generally, wild birds carry relatively benign versions of these viruses, which pose little immediate threat to birds or people. But flu viruses can change quickly, accumulating new mutations and swapping genetic material. These changes can, and sometimes do, turn a ho-hum virus into a lethal one, like the version of H5N1 that is currently circulating. Much of the time, flu circulates in shorebirds and gulls at low levels, often turning up in fewer than one percent of samples. But at the Delaware Bay in May and early June, it explodes, passing easily from bird to bird. Over the years, the St. Jude team has found it in 12 percent of their samples, on average, though that figure has climbed as high as 33 percent. They have found almost every subtype of influenza A, in addition to novel remixes, which can emerge when an animal is infected by more than one version of the virus at once. To keep an eye on what's circulating, the St. Jude scientists work closely with Dr. Niles and his colleagues, who use the spring stopover as an opportunity to assess the health of the shorebirds, which face a variety of threats, from climate change to the over-harvesting of horseshoe crabs. Dr. Niles and his team typically head out to the beaches first to count, catch, examine and tag the birds. They then relay the birds' whereabouts to the flu-hunting avian-clean-up crew. 'We will then go out and pick up the poop,' Dr. Kercher said. 'A unique year' But on the team's first full day of field work this spring, by the time the conservationists had finished their work, the tide was roaring back in. So for hours, the St. Jude scientists bided their time, waiting for the water to recede and hoping that they would still be able to find some flocks. 'We are at the mercy of the birds, and the birds don't tell us what they're doing,' Dr. Kercher said. It was nearly 4 p.m. when they finally rumbled down a gravel road, past the pine forests and the marshes, and arrived at one local beach, where shorebirds had been spotted earlier. Dr. McKenzie, clad in black joggers and a hooded, gray waffle-knit top, climbed out of the car and surveyed the beach. Horseshoe crabs stretched out along the high-tide line. In the distance, a flock of small birds scuttled around in the water. Dr. McKenzie lifted her binoculars. Bingo: They were ruddy turnstones, sandpipers whose tricolor markings are sometimes compared to those of a calico cat. These birds, the St. Jude team has learned, are especially likely to carry flu viruses. The scientists donned gloves and masks, a recently added safety precaution. 'It's not something that we've done in the past,' Dr. McKenzie said, 'but this is a unique year.' The new H5N1 strain first showed up in North America in late 2021 and spread rapidly across the continent. It led to the death of nearly 60 million farmed birds, killed scores of wild ones and even felled some unlucky mammals, from red foxes to gray seals. The St. Jude team found no trace of H5N1 at the Delaware Bay last spring. But at the time, the virus had not yet made its way to the shorebirds' South American wintering grounds. By this spring, it had, which means that the birds could bring it back with them. 'We absolutely are worried it's going to show up,' Dr. Kercher said. So the scientists were doubling down on their surveillance, aiming to collect 1,000 fecal samples instead of their standard 600. They began picking their way down the beach, eyes cast down as they searched for the right white splotches. Not any droppings would do; it had to be fresh excrement, ideally from ruddy turnstones and red knots, another sandpiper species. The scientists have become good at telling the two types of droppings apart. 'The turnstones are mostly logs,' Dr. McKenzie said. 'The red knots kind of have more of a splat.' When the scientists spotted a suitable splotch, they dropped to their knees and unsheathed round-tipped swabs. Sometimes it took a few tries to successfully collect a sample. 'It's not the easiest technique with these tools,' said Patrick Seiler, a member of the research team. 'In the blowing wind, trying to scoop up poop and put it in a little vial.' Flu clues They stowed the samples in a small plastic cooler, of a kind that a vacationer might bring to these same beaches. Later, the samples would be shipped back to the lab in Memphis for testing and analysis. Typically, the researchers sequence the viruses they find, looking for notable mutations and charting their evolution over time, and then select a subset to study in different kinds of cells and animal models. Over the past few decades, this work has helped the scientists learn more about what 'run-of-the-mill' bird flu viruses look like and how they behave, said Richard Webby, an influenza expert on the St. Jude team. It has also helped them spot outliers. 'And that leads us on a chase,' Dr. Webby said, which can end up revealing 'something about the fundamental biology of these viruses.' In 2009, some of the viruses they found turned out to be surprisingly good at spreading among ferrets. Further study of those viruses helped the researchers identify genetic mutations that might facilitate the airborne transmission of flu among mammals. If the team finds H5N1 this year, Dr. Webby and his colleagues will look for changes that the virus might have acquired as it moved through the shorebirds, as well as any that might make it more dangerous to humans or resistant to vaccines and treatments. The virus has already evolved markedly since its arrival in North America, Dr. Webby and his colleagues reported in a recent paper, which was based on analysis of viral samples isolated from birds outside of the Delaware Bay region. The new variants they found have not gained the ability to spread easily among mammals, but some are capable of causing serious neurological symptoms in mammals that become infected. If the virus shows up in this year's Delaware Bay samples, it will be yet another sign that H5N1 is becoming increasingly entrenched in North America. It could also spell trouble for some of the shorebirds, especially the red knots, whose numbers have dropped precipitously in recent decades. For these birds, H5N1 is a great unknown threat, Dr. Niles said. And so, although the excrement collection process remains as unglamorous as ever, the stakes feel high as the scientists work their way down the beach. All they can say is that they haven't found the new H5N1 virus yet. 'But that doesn't mean that we won't,' Dr. McKenzie said, carefully scooping up the scatological clues the birds had left behind. 'I guess we will find out.'

{"id": "320", "title": "El Ni�, not avian flu, caused the deaths of hundreds of birds in Mexico, government says", "date": "2023-06-15", "fulltext": "MEXICO CITY (AP) When hundreds of birds were found dead along Mexico's Pacific coast earlier this year, experts immediately suspected avian flu. But the government said Thursday that the warming Pacific ocean currents associated with El Niño, not bird flu, were responsible for the mass die-off. Mexico's Agriculture Department said Thursday that tests on the dead birds revealed they had died of starvation, not flu. The department said that warming surface water in the Pacific caused by El Niño can drive fish into deeper, cooler water, making it harder for birds to find food. Most of the dead birds were Sooty Shearwaters, seagulls and pelicans. They died in states ranging from Chiapas, on the border with Guatemala, all the way north and west to Baja California. According to autopsies carried out by veterinarians and specialized biologists, it was found that the animals died of starvation, the department said. The most probable cause of this epidemiological event is the warming of the waters of the Pacific due to the El Niño meteorological effect, which causes fish to seek deeper, colder waters, preventing sea birds from catching food. El Niño is a natural, temporary and occasional warming of part of the Pacific that shifts weather patterns across the globe. In May, U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate scientist Michelle L'Heureux said El Niño had formed this year a month or two earlier than usual, which gives it room to grow, and there's a 56% chance it will be considered strong and a 25% chance it reaches supersized levels.

{"id": "321", "title": "Human gene identified that prevents most bird flu viruses moving to people", "date": "2023-06-28", "fulltext": "Discovery means targeted solutions can be directed to avian flu viruses sooner to prevent spillover into humans, say scientists. Scientists have discovered that a gene present in humans is preventing most avian flu viruses moving from birds to people. The gene is present in all humans and can be found in the lungs and upper respiratory tract, where flu viruses replicate. It was already known to scientists, but the gene's antiviral abilities are a new discovery. A six-year investigative study led by the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research found that the BTN3A3 gene is a powerful barrier against most avian flu viruses. Although relatively rare, some avian flu virus strains have periodically spilled over into humans. Two of the most recent H5N1 cases were reported in UK poultry farm workers in May this year. Human cases of H5N1 bird flu were first found in Hong Kong in 1997. Globally since 2003, 873 human H5N1 infections have been reported to the World Health Organization. Of those, 458 people died. The study found that some bird and swine flu viruses have a genetic mutation that allows them to escape the blocking effects of the BTN3A3 gene and infect people. By tracking the history of human influenza pandemics and linking resistance to the gene with key virus types, the researchers concluded that all human influenza pandemics, including the 1918 Spanish flu and the 2009 swine flu pandemics, were a result of BTN3A3-resistant strains. The findings suggest that resistance to the gene could help determine whether flu strains have human pandemic potential or not. That may lead to testing of wild birds, poultry and other animals susceptible to flu viruses such as pigs, for BTN3A3-resistant viruses. The antiviral functions of the [BTN3A3] gene appeared 40m years ago in primates, said Prof Massimo Palmarini who led the study and is director of Glasgow's virology research centre. Understanding the barriers that block avian flu in humans means better targeted solutions and better control measures to prevent the spillovers. He said that if a gene-resistant virus was identified, we can direct preventative measures to those viruses, sooner, to prevent the spillover [into humans]. Dr Rute Maria Pinto, the study's lead author, said: It's pretty amazing, isn't it? We are all fairly proud about the outcome. This gene had been identified before, and other functions were attributed to it, but we found that the gene is antiviral against avian flu. No one had found that before. She said the discovery was expected to have immediate practical applications. Now, when we find cases of bird flu, we can basically swab sick birds, carcasses or faeces and find out whether the virus can overcome the BTN3A3 gene, simply by looking at its sequence and determining if this virus is more or less likely to jump into humans. If the virus can in fact overcome BTN3A3 then stricter measurements should be put in place to prevent spillovers. Pinto added: As a scientist we are expected to find solutions to problems, to give back to the taxpayers that fund this [research], and to find something that can be used straight away is really impactful. The study was also able to retrospectively identify increases in gene-resistant viruses ahead of previous human spillovers. Before the H7N9 bird flu virus outbreak, which first infected humans in China in 2013, the study found an increased frequency of the BTN3A3-resistant genotype [in birds] in 2011-2012. To date there have been almost 1,570 cases of H7N9 and at least 616 deaths. I guess what these observations provide is a snapshot of what the frequency of the BTN3A3 resistant gene was at different period of times in the birds, Palmarini said. Because birds haven't got BTN3A3, there is no evolutionary pressure to keep, or not, those traits. He said certain mutations might make the virus more or less fitter in the birds but this had not yet been studied. Similarly, before the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, the study found H1N1 gene resistance in pigs occurring between 2002 and 2006.

{"id": "323", "title": "Dozens of cats in Poland had bird flu but the risk to people is low, the UN health agency says", "date": "2023-07-17", "fulltext": "LONDON (AP) — The World Health Organization said more than two dozen cats have been infected with bird flu across Poland, but no people appeared to have been sickened. In a statement on Monday, the U.N. health agency said it was the first time so many cats had been reported to have bird flu over such a wide geographical area in a single country, amid an unprecedented global outbreak of the latest version of the H5N1 version of the disease. WHO said that late last month, Polish authorities informed agency officials of the unusual deaths of more than 45 cats in 13 geographical regions of the country. Testing last week found that 29 had H5N1. As of June, the most recent variant of H5N1 has been reported in birds and other animal species in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Since 2020, WHO said a dozen human cases have been reported. Scientists worry that rising cases of H5N1, particularly in animals that have frequent contact with humans, might lead to a mutated version of the disease that could spread easily between people, triggering another pandemic. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many experts had suspected that the next global outbreak would be sparked by H5N1. But while bird flu has killed hundreds of millions of birds globally, it has sickened fewer than 900 people since 2003 and has not been able to spread easily among humans. WHO said it was unclear how the domestic cats in Poland became infected with bird flu and said officials were still investigating possible sources of exposure, including contact with wild birds that are known to carry H5N1. The agency said the risk of people in Poland being infected with bird flu was low and low to moderate for people exposed to cats, including cat owners and veterinarians. Last week, WHO and partners warned that the increasing numbers of mammals infected with H5N1 were unusual. Experts have previously cautioned that pigs, which are susceptible to flu viruses from both humans and birds, might act as a 'mixing vessel,' leading to the emergence of mutated viruses that could be lethal to people. Since last year, authorities in 10 countries have reported bird flu outbreaks in mammals, including farmed mink in Spain, seals in the U.S., and sea lions in Peru and Chile. Eds: UPDATES: Adds audio.

Members of the public visiting the Pembrokeshire coast have been urged not to handle dead or sick birds and keep dogs away from them. Pembrokeshire county council said on Thursday: 'Hundreds of seabirds have been washed up on beaches on the south Pembrokeshire coast recently. The birds are being regularly removed, although more are being washed up between the clear-ups. Most are guillemots, although razorbills and gannets have also been reported. Testing has taken place on a sample of the dead birds, and avian influenza (bird flu) has this week been confirmed. A multi-agency response is in place to deal with the issue.' The coast and islands off Pembrokeshire provide vital habitats for colonies of seabirds. Skomer, for example, has internationally important colonies of puffins and Manx shearwaters and was a star of the Sir David Attenborough BBC series Wild Isles earlier this year. The outbreak comes at an unfortunate time for the area, with thousands of visitors heading there for summer holidays. James Parkin, the director of nature and tourism at Pembrokeshire Coast national park authority, said: 'We anticipate an increase in the numbers of birds being washed ashore following the recent bad weather and we are urging people not to handle any dead or sick wild birds they may come across, to keep their dogs away, and to follow the advice provided in reporting any incidents.' Lisa Morgan from the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales said: 'It is really important that members of the public don't touch dead or sick birds but also that they help us to understand the conservation impacts on our internationally important seabird populations by continuing to report any they might find.' Rhian Sula, National Trust Cymru's general manager for Pembrokeshire, added: 'We are saddened by the discovery of dead birds across some of the beaches we care for in Pembrokeshire.

{"id": "325", "title": "Avian flu may have killed millions of birds globally as outbreak ravages South America", "date": "2023-07-22", "fulltext": "Virus has spread around the world, with 200,000 wild birds dead in Peru alone and concerns Australia could be next. Millions of wild birds may have died from bird flu globally in the latest outbreak, researchers have said, as the viral disease ravages South America, with 200,000 deaths recorded in Peru alone. The highly infectious variant of H5N1, which gained momentum in the winter of 2021, caused Europe's worst bird flu outbreak before spreading globally. The disease reached South America in November 2022, and has now been reported on every continent except Oceania and Antarctica. Working out how many wild birds have died is difficult because so many carcasses are never found or counted. Michelle Wille, from the University of Sydney, co-authored research that is believed to be the first attempt to assess numbers on a global scale. It documents deaths since October 2021. 'We estimate the scale of mortality among wild birds is in the millions rather than tens of thousands reported,' the paper says. 'The outbreaks among wild birds are causing population and species level concerns which may drive extinctions and jeopardise decades of conservation efforts,' it adds. More than 40% of all Peruvian pelicans dying over a period of a few weeks in early 2023. More than 100,000 boobies have died and 85,000 cormorants, according to Peruvian government data. Wille said: 'South America has been incredibly hard hit and the numbers are staggering. Outbreaks are having very real species and population-level effects, such that there is concern that some populations may never recover. The situation is extremely distressing. We are extremely concerned for what will happen in spring [in the southern hemisphere] as the virus has now been detected in Tierra del Fuego, which implies an increased risk for the virus to emerge in Antarctica.' Peru has been very active in recording deaths from bird flu, but other countries have been less open about what is happening, said Ian Brown, director of scientific services at the UK's Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha). For example, Brazil—the world's biggest chicken meat exporter—was one of the last countries to confirm it had cases in wild birds, six months after reports from Peru. There is also an issue with countries not having enough resources to report on the impact of the virus, Brown said. 'I would be cautious about saying Peru is a particular hotspot—it's probably not alone.' He added: 'What's happened is that this virus has found its way into South America for the very first time. In Europe, and to some extent North America, we've had cases like this in the last few years so they will build up some immunity. But birds in South America have not seen this virus before.' This may explain why mortality rates are so high. Elsewhere, significant population impacts around the world include 17% of sandwich terns dying in Europe in 2022; 40% of south-east European Dalmatian pelicans dying in 2021, and 62% of Caspian terns breeding on Lake Michigan dying in 2022. Data shows the disease has also been detected in Indonesia, with concerns its next stop could be Australia. 'That's the first time in the history of this virus, or group of viruses, that we've seen that global spread on such a scale. It's a gamechanger,' said Brown. Europe is now on its second breeding season with H5N1. The virus hasn't changed, but it has affected different birds in Europe this year compared with last year. Black-headed gulls across the continent and in the UK have been hit badly, as well as terns. Nationally, 10% of black-headed gulls have died since the end of March, which means at least 30,000 dead individuals, not including the many thousands of dead chicks, according to James Pearce-Higgins, director of science at the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). 'There have been tragic tales of people seeing dead black-headed gulls with chicks trying to nestle up to them.' The two species, terns and black-headed gulls, nest in similar places and close together, making for easy disease transmission between them. 'The picture I've given you is a microcosm of what is happening across Europe,' said Pearce-Higgins. Other birds have been less badly affected. Northern gannets and great skuas—which were severely hit in 2022—appear to have had very few deaths this year. Early research suggests some have immunity but others simply may not have been exposed. Researchers still don't know what proportion of individuals are able to recover from bird flu, how long that immunity lasts and how much protection it gives. In gannets, it appears darker eyes indicate the bird might have some immunity. Although UK seabird breeding colonies have not been as badly hit as last year, a number of outbreaks have occurred in recent weeks. Earlier this month rangers described their 'heartbreak' at discovering more than 600 dead chicks at Britain's largest mainland Arctic tern colony in Long Nanny on the Northumberland coast. There has also been an increase in cases in north Wales, with reports of dead terns, herring gulls and puffins. Hundreds of birds have washed up on the east coast of Scotland. Last year, there were widespread impacts on a number of species, with data collected by the Guardian showing H5N1 had killed at least 50,000 wild birds—double previous estimates. The effects of last year's outbreak are now being felt on the number of birds returning this year. Early signs from Scotland suggest great skuas in Shetland have been hit particularly hard, according to Nature Scot. At one reserve, Hermaness in Shetland, 90% may have been lost, suggesting 'significant breeding population declines' compared with last year, the agency said. Scotland has 60% of the world's population of great skuas. Looking at UN surveillance data it appears Europe still has more cases than anywhere else but that will be down to reporting. Brown said: 'Gaps on the map do not mean the virus is not there. Look at central Asia [where] there are big holes, in parts of Africa there are big holes, and that is simply because there isn't surveillance being done. It would be premature to say this current strain of H5N1 is going to die out any time soon.

{"id": "326", "title": "Bird Flu Has Never Done This Before", "date": "2023-08-03", "fulltext": "At bird breeding grounds this spring and summer, the skies have been clearer and quieter, the flocks drastically thinned. Last year, more than 60 percent of the Caspian terns at Lake Michigan vanished; the flock of great skuas at the Hermaness reserve, in Scotland, may have shrunk by 90 percent. Now more broken bodies are turning up: a massacre of 600 arctic-tern chicks in the United Kingdom; a rash of pelicans, cormorants, gulls, and terns washed up along West African coasts. In recent months, Peruvian officials have reported the loss of tens of thousands of pelicans—by some estimates, up to 40 percent of the country's total population. The deaths are the latest casualties of the outbreak of H5N1 avian flu that's been tearing its way across the world. In the past couple of years, more than 100 million domestic poultry have died, many of them deliberately culled; out in the wild, the deaths may be in the millions too—the corpses have just been too inaccessible and too numerous for scientists to count. \"It's been carnage,\" Michelle Wille, a virologist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, told me. \"For many species, we are losing decades of conservation work.\" For months, experts worried most about the outbreak's magnitude—it struck so swiftly and lethally that it's become the most deadly H5N1 epidemic recorded in North America. Now the looming concern is length: when, and if, the virus will withdraw. History would seem to be on our side, at least in North America: Earlier versions of avian flu that made it to this side of the world flamed out within a year or two, quashed by the ebb and flow of migrating hosts and by concerted poultry culls. But this new strain is stubborn, pounding the continent more or less continuously. \"That has never happened before,\" Vijaykrishna Dhanasekaran, a virologist at Hong Kong University, told me. Read: Eagles are falling, bears are going blind The situation has grown dire enough that last month, the United States began, for the first time in history, to offer avian-flu vaccines to birds—starting with critically endangered California condors, which have lost more than 20 members of their very small population to the virus and cannot afford more, Ashleigh Blackford, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's California-condor coordinator, told me. This choice is one of many grim and tacit acknowledgments that this virus is now so entrenched that it's almost certain to circulate here indefinitely. The longer the virus lingers, the greater the chance that it will pose a different danger: permanent tenancy among mammals, a group that, historically, the virus has not easily infected and spread among. Some experts worry that the virus has now managed to establish new methods of transmission in select communities of mink and foxes on fur farms, and maybe in wild seals. The chances of an outbreak among people—certainly, of another pandemic—are still, in absolute terms, low, Nádia Trovão, a virologist at the Fogarty International Center, told me. But the more new places H5N1 establishes itself for good, the more its threat to us will grow. Scientists can't yet say why this particular flu virus has found such unprecedented success in North America, only that it has. In the two years since its arrival, it has infiltrated more birds and mammals—including species not previously known to be vulnerable to avian flus—than has any other pathogen of its ilk. Among the most affected creatures have been wild birds, a major departure from previous strains that primarily attacked poultry. And although past viruses in this family have been relatively slow to evolve, this one keeps amping up its genetic diversity by mixing its genome with bits of other bird-borne flus—tweaks that may be helping H5N1 find even more new hosts and execute further genomic changes still.

In certain parts of the U.S. and Europe, case counts in the wild seem to be slumping. And scientists are stumbling upon gannets in Scotland carrying antibodies to the virus—and whose eyes have, in the aftermath of presumed infection, bizarrely changed color from blue to black. Wendy Puryear, a virologist at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, is now searching for similar hints of immunity in gray seals. Should this pattern continue, there's hope that the virus, at least in this part of the world, could \"just fizzle out,\" Dhanasekaran said. Wille and other researchers, though, are looking toward autumn with a degree of dread. Another surge of disease could appear then, especially as seasonal migrations return birds to their overwintering homes. Even without a fall comeback, the math is against elimination in North America, where the virus has infiltrated well over 100 species. At this point, H5N1 lingering in at least some creatures seems far likelier than a full and permanent retreat. For people, the news is still, tentatively, okay. \"In its current form, the virus has very, very low transmissibility to humans,\" with just a handful of cases detected, says Ian Barr, the deputy director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza. But the list of mammals catching the virus is still growing. In some of these outbreaks, the root cause is likely avian, experts told me: cats eating raw poultry; raccoons, skunks, and other scavengers presumably snarfing the carcasses of infected birds. Other cases, though—seals at sea, foxes and mink crowded into fur farms—seem better explained by mammals catching H5N1 directly from another of their own kind. Given the sheer number of animals involved, \"it's hard to fathom that each was individually exposed to an infected bird,\" Louise Moncla, an avian-influenza expert at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. Read: We vaccinate animals more than ourselves Since the virus arrived in North America, it also appears to have become deadlier, with particularly devastating effects when it infiltrates certain creatures' brains, Richard Webby, a virologist and the director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, told me. Fox kits have been found racked with tremors; bears have gone partially blind. To truly transform into an even worse scourge, the virus would need to shape-shift from a pathogen that primarily plagues bird guts into one that could easily infiltrate mammalian lungs. The virus has already taken at least one step toward that: Researchers sampling H5N1-infected mammals, including foxes, mink, cats, seals, and even a person, have detected genetic tweaks that are helping the microbe replicate inside mammalian cells. But a boost in infective capability alone isn't enough for a large-scale outbreak, Webby said. The virus would probably need to circumvent some mammal-specific immune defenses. And it would certainly need to acquire the ability to more efficiently transmit between mammalian hosts via, say, an airborne route. There's not yet evidence, Webby told me, that the virus has pulled off such changes, though just a few might suffice: better binding to receptors on mammalian lung cells, a more stable structure so it could travel via aerosol. That said, the criteria for properly mammalizing a flu virus \"are not really well understood,\" Moncla said. All that's certain is that the chasm between birds and mammals is not uncrossable. No single intervention will quash H5N1's potential pandemic threat. Avian-flu vaccines have been developed for humans, but for now, Trovão, of the Fogarty International Center, told me, the priority is keeping the virus out of cramped, often unsanitary communities of mammals where it could rack up further mutations. Vaccinating poultry, too, would help, says Mariette Ducatez, a virologist at the National Veterinary School of Toulouse. The practice is already relatively common in countries where avian influenza is endemic, including China, Egypt, and Vietnam. This fall, France is likely to introduce shots for a subset of its domesticated birds; regulators in the U.S. have mulled eventually doing the same. But avian-flu vaccines can be expensive, difficult to administer, and better at tempering disease severity than blocking spread. Without vigilant monitoring, the virus could spread silently in vaccinated flocks, especially those with spotty coverage, where the microbe could be pressured to evolve in new ways. On the global market, many poultry buyers are also reluctant to import vaccinated birds. The stakes for vaccinating wild animals are less economic but no less fraught. And although researchers believe that the recently inoculated California condors are tolerating the new shots well, other species aren't necessarily next in line. In most cases, vaccinating wild animals just isn't practical, Trovão told me. Even for the condors, which are already closely monitored by scientists and used to frequent human contact, shots are \"not sustainable, really, not long term,\" Samantha Gibbs, a wildlife veterinarian at U.S. Fish and Wildlife, told me. Scientists still can't say for sure how well the vaccines will work in the birds or how long protection might last. \"This was a last resort,\" Gibbs said, \"just an attempt to get them through this.\" But with H5N1 still raging and the birds still vulnerable, Gibbs and her team suspect that they'll have little choice but to continue vaccinating the condors on an annual basis. If this current threat doesn't force their hand, maybe the next one will.

A specialist in emerging infectious diseases, Sironen has conducted research at fur farms for years. She helped develop a Covid vaccine that was deployed to the country's mink population during the pandemic. She knows the industry well. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics two months ago released its first formal clinical practice guidelines centered on the screening and treatment of young patients with obesity, there is still no consensus on how best to approach obesity in children, STAT explains. While some praised the guidelines, others complain there is a focus on weight instead of health, a lack of clarity or directness about who the recommendations are for, too little input from various subspecialists, a reliance on mediocre or limited data, and a downplaying of the long-term implications of drug treatment and surgery. Some of the world’s leading makers of flu vaccines say they could make hundreds of millions of bird flu shots for humans within months if a new strain of avian influenza ever jumps across the species divide, according to Reuters. One current outbreak of avian flu known as H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has killed record numbers of birds and infected mammals. Human cases, however, remain very rare, and global health officials have said the risk of transmission between humans is still low. GSK, Moderna, and CSL Seqirus say they are already developing or about to test sample human vaccines that better match the circulating subtype, as a precautionary measure against a future pandemic. The state of California and a nonprofit generic drug manufacturer announced a 10-year partnership to produce affordable, state-branded insulin that they hope will rival longtime producers and push down prices for a medication used by millions of Americans, the Associated Press writes. The product is not expected on store shelves until at least next year, and it is difficult to predict what effect it would have on a market already shaken by change. Earlier this month, three major insulin makers promised steep price cuts. Meanwhile, the state and its partner, Civica, have yet to locate a manufacturing facility based in California. And regulatory approvals will be needed. Three years into the pandemic, a program backed by the United Nations to build a network of self-reliant research and manufacturing sites for mRNA vaccines is struggling, The Washington Post explains. The program is seeking a large increase in funds to ensure its sustainability, its backers say, raising concerns about the long-term future of the effort. The U.S. has yet to respond to a funding request for $100 million, sent late last year by the backers of the program, which is being organized primarily by the Medicines Patent Pool, a U.N.-supported public health organization. The support would about double its funding overall. Moderna chief executive officer Stéphane Bancel is starting to reap gargantuan gains from the stock he first got when he started with the company a decade ago, although nearly all of this chunk of his fortune remains earmarked for unknown charities, STAT reports. Bancel made $398 million in 2022 based on the actual realized gains of stock that was exercised and sold, according to STAT calculations from Moderna’s annual compensation disclosure filed last week. The more commonly reported compensation figure, $19.4 million, is less accurate and does not factor in the value Bancel actually received from his stock. A decade into the era of the HIV prevention pill, called PrEP, efforts to leverage its heralded power to curb new infections have stagnated in the U.S., NBC News tells us. This shortfall is a key reason the nation lags far behind many others in combating HIV, with a national epidemic long plagued by racial inequities and only a modestly declining rate of new infections. On the bright side, PrEP, which is short for pre-exposure prophylaxis and involves taking either oral or injectable prescription antiretroviral medications in advance of potential HIV exposure, has indeed achieved substantial popularity but only among white gay and bisexual men, who have long seen a dropping HIV rate. Karuna Therapeutics disclosed that its treatment for schizophrenia reduced psychosis reported by patients achieving the main goal of a large clinical trial and supporting similarly positive results from previously conducted studies, STAT writes. The company intends to file a marketing application for its drug, called KarXT, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the middle of the year. If approved, the Karuna drug would usher in the first new class of medicines for the treatment of schizophrenia in decades. In the Phase 3 study, KarXT taken twice per day reduced schizophrenia symptoms by 20.6 points compared with a placebo decrease of 12.2 points.

{"id": "328", "title": "Overhaul poultry farming to tackle spread of bird flu, urge campaigners", "date": "2023-08-22", "fulltext": "Report argues chickens should be kept in much smaller flocks and given more space The industrial poultry farming sector needs to be radically restructured to stop the spread of bird flu, says a report that argues wild birds are victims rather than the main vectors of the disease. Bird flu is spiralling out of control and being spread by intensive poultry farms, according to a report by the campaign group Compassion in World Farming (CIWF). Overcrowded sheds provide a perfect place for viruses to mutate and spread, it argues. Chickens should instead be kept in much smaller flocks and given more space. The report suggests a three-point action plan: mass vaccination of poultry to stop the spread; a radical restructuring of the industry to raise healthier birds in better environments; and changing the way pigs are farmed, as it says factory farmed pigs can act as 'mixing vessels' to create new pig, bird and human viruses. CIWF has written to the UK, US and various European governments urging them to work with the World Organisation for Animal Health and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization to put these measures in place. Its chief policy adviser, Peter Stevenson, said: 'Bird flu is like a ticking timebomb. Unless we wake up and take urgent action to end factory farming, we will simply be unable to stop its rapid spread across the globe or reduce the risk of a serious human pandemic developing. Cramming animals together in factory farms is not only totally inhumane, it's creating the perfect place for bird flu and other viruses to spread and mutate into more dangerous strains.' The RSPCA agreed that industrial poultry farm must be reformed. Dr Marc Cooper, the charity's head of farm animals, said: 'We support calls for an end to intensive farming and want to see all farmed animals, including poultry, kept in higher welfare conditions, as well as the use of more robust, higher welfare breeds. Improving the welfare of farm animals has multiple environmental and societal benefits, including helping better control diseases. When animals are kept intensively and breeds that have inherent health issues are used, the animals are more likely to have compromised immune systems and be more susceptible to diseases. Higher welfare farming can therefore help reduce disease risk.' He noted that the use of vaccines was currently experimental. 'We welcome any research into possible vaccinations which would help tackle this destructive disease. However, we believe effective vaccines are currently a long way off coming to fruition, so it's important that bird welfare is much better protected now,' he said. 'We believe the long-term strategy to eradicate the virus needs to be a combination of vaccinations, higher welfare farming practices, which includes more robust breeds, and excellent biosecurity.' Richard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council, hit back at the report. He said: 'Avian influenza is carried into the UK by migratory birds. As a result, it spreads amongst the domestic wild bird population. No bird has avian influenza when it goes on to farm. All incidents derive from outside the farm through wild bird incursion. When disease is detected, the farm is culled so disease is not spread. Therefore, indoor production methods do not aid in the spread of disease. Conflating disease control with your opinion on how we produce food in the UK is an irresponsible way of approaching our primary concern here: ensuring the health of our birds and the sustainability of a world-class food system producing nutritious and affordable food. In these times, that matters more than ever.' More than half a billion farmed birds have died or been culled globally due to bird flu since 2021.

{"id": "329", "title": "Endangered California Condors Get Bird Flu Vaccine", "date": "2023-08-29", "fulltext": "The threat of avian influenza became real for Ashleigh Blackford in March. Three years after the world took drastic steps to slow the spread of a different respiratory virus, she found herself living a twisted version of that experience—this time with the nearly 600 iconic birds she oversees as California Condor coordinator at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus) are North America's largest wild birds and are among the most endangered. In 1982 there were just 22 of the birds left. Conservationists captured and bred them to painstakingly claw the birds back from the brink of extinction. At the beginning of this year, there were 561 California Condors, more than half of which lived in the wild across several western U.S. states. But this spring, as March turned into April and more birds got sick, the species' success looked imperiled. \"It was [like], 'We've lost five birds today. We lost two more,' and it just kind of felt like it was snowballing on us,\" Blackford says of the losses. Many of these were condors that had roosted in Arizona's Vermilion Cliffs, the same place where captive-bred birds were first released in 1996. By the end of spring, avian influenza had killed 21 condors out of the flock that soars over Arizona and Utah and Blackford says the outcome could have been much worse. Now the FWS has begun testing an avian influenza vaccine in the iconic birds in hopes of eventually inoculating every living condor against the disease, which experts fear may come roaring back as temperatures drop this fall. Avian influenza comes in two varieties. Traditionally, wild birds have been known to carry low-pathogenicity avian influenza, which is typically asymptomatic, whereas highly pathogenic avian influenza is usually found in poultry. But in Europe a highly pathogenic strain became epidemic in numerous species of wild birds by 2021, and the strain reached the U.S. the following year. By now that strain has likely killed millions of wild birds, experts estimate. \"This is very different from what we've seen historically [from avian influenza],\" says Samantha Gibbs, lead veterinarian at the FWS Wildlife Health Office. \"I don't think it's just going to disappear.\" And while dead Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia), Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) are bad news, none of those animals are as rare as the California Condor. \"With a really nice, big population that's healthy, we may lose a number of birds, but we would feel like they could bounce back,\" Gibbs says. \"We just don't have that bench strength with the condors.\" Condors are particularly vulnerable to avian influenza because of how they live, says Jonathan Hall, a wildlife ecologist at Eastern Michigan University, who specializes in the massive birds. Like humans, \"they really interact with each other quite a bit, so that makes this disease much more easily communicable,\" he says. \"We're talking about animals that live in extended family groups and kin networks.\" Blackford says the flock that suffered from the virus this spring may have inadvertently cultivated it in cool, damp cliff-bound sanctuaries where they raise their chicks. \"I think we had some little petri dishes in our nest caves that unfortunately had a greater impact on our population than if they had known to social distance,\" she says. Unlike more plentiful species, condors are confronting avian influenza with the cards stacked against them. The mighty birds struggle to maintain their numbers because, like humans, they mature slowly and then reproduce at a low rate; they naturally lay just one egg every year or two. Although conservationists have found ways to increase that rate slightly in a captive breeding program, every bird remains precious. \"They're on this growth trajectory, but it's slow going, and it's really expensive, and condors are clearly not at a level where they're self-sustaining,\" says Jacqueline Robinson, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied the birds' genome. \"This loss of so many individuals in such a short time is a pretty big setback for them on that road to once again being a wild, free-ranging, self-sustaining population.\" Desperate for anything that could protect the condors, the FWS reached out to the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ask for permission to test an avian influenza vaccine in the birds. \"We didn't know if there would be a vaccine even available,\" Gibbs says. \"Because no birds have ever been vaccinated against highly pathogenic avian influenza in the U.S., we didn't think it was a high probability.\" After some discussion, the USDA authorized the FWS to use a vaccine developed from a killed virus found in a Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) in the mid-2010s, Gibbs says. But the USDA was reluctant to release a vaccine that could end up being used in poultry because there's no way to differentiate between such domesticated birds that have been infected with avian influenza and those that have been vaccinated for it. The agency included strict constraints on the condor program to ensure none of the vaccine makes its way to poultry and imperils the $5-billion export market for the latter birds. \"There are very tight controls on the way we use and administer the vaccine,\" Gibbs says. \"It's akin to using controlled substances, like ketamine.\" For example, only a certified veterinarian can administer the vaccine, and each vial must be destroyed within 24 hours after it is opened, she says. Once the condor team had the precious vaccine in hand, the first step was to test it on 20 Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus), which are not endangered, to check for any negative side effects. Now condors are receiving the shot, and 20 birds have been fully vaccinated as of August 25, according to the FWS. Although poultry vaccines are typically administered in two doses, the agency is testing how effective it is to give both the prime shot and the booster in one injection, compared with the usual strategy. How does one vaccinate a 20-pound bird with a nine-foot wingspan and a hooked beak that is often found slicing through an animal carcass? Blackford says experienced condor wranglers are accustomed to using one hand to clamp the beak shut while using the other to hold the bird. A second person does the injecting down near the bird's hip, Gibbs says. With the initial doses doled out to the trial condors, the FWS is now monitoring the birds and preparing to measure antibody levels to the virus in their blood beginning next month. \"Step one was safety, step two is efficacy, and then step three will be 'What's the practicality in the wild flock?'\" Blackford says. She says that if all goes well, she and her colleagues hope to plan a rollout strategy by, perhaps, October to protect all the condors before spring migration starts. Then the team will look into giving the birds annual boosters, which Blackford says she hopes can easily fit into the yearly health checks the team already conducts. During these checks, each bird is vaccinated for West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne pathogen that also threatens them, and has blood drawn to check for lead exposure from hunters' ammunition in mammal carcasses that the massive scavengers eat. Those standard health checks are a testament to the effort people have poured into keeping condors in the sky. And while Blackford says she's grateful to have a path toward protecting her charges from avian influenza, she would rather it wasn't necessary. \"Our goal is not to always touch every condor every year—it's to not touch them, to not be able to capture them because they're so wild and so self-sufficient,\" Blackford says. Unfortunately, entering that next phase of recovery will require changing human behavior, not just neutralizing a virus, she says, because hunters' use of lead bullets remains condors' biggest threat. \"I think it's a lot easier to combat the avian flu issue because it's much more straightforward,\" Hall says. \"The ongoing threats that condors face, really primarily because of the way that the environment has changed over the last 500 years on this continent due to colonization—that's a much harder issue to address.\"", "media_outlet": "SciAm", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "Now the FWS has begun testing an avian influenza vaccine in the iconic birds in hopes of eventually inoculating every living condor against the disease, which experts fear may come roaring back as temperatures drop this fall.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "\"This is very different from what we've seen historically [from avian influenza],\" says Samantha Gibbs, lead veterinarian at the FWS Wildlife Health Office. \"I don't think it's just going to disappear.\"", "affirm_transmissible_statement_3": "Condors are particularly vulnerable to avian influenza because of how they live, says Jonathan Hall, a wildlife ecologist at Eastern Michigan University, who specializes in the massive birds.

{"id": "330", "title": "Bird Flu Raced Through South America. Antarctica Could Be Next.", "date": "2023-08-30", "fulltext": "More than 100 million birds breed in the region, and many are likely to be vulnerable to the virus, scientists warned. Over the last three years, a highly lethal form of avian influenza has whipped around the world, felling birds in Europe, Africa and Asia before jumping across the ocean and setting off the worst bird flu outbreak in United States history. Last fall, the virus, known as H5N1, finally arrived in South America. It raced quickly down the Pacific coast and killed wild birds and marine mammals in staggering numbers. Peru and Chile alone have reported more than 500,000 dead seabirds and 25,000 dead sea lions, according to a new report, which was published last week by OFFLU, a global network of flu experts. Now, scientists are worried that the virus will make its way to Antarctica, one of only two continents — along with Australia — that have not yet been hit by the pathogen. “The negative impact of this virus on Antarctic wildlife could be immense — likely worse than that on South American wildlife,” the report warns. More than 100 million birds breed in Antarctica and on the islands nearby, and many marine mammals swim in the surrounding waters. Some of those species, including the distinctive emperor penguin and Antarctic fur seal, crowd together in large colonies. “And that could be a recipe for disaster,” said Dr. Ralph Vanstreels, a researcher at a Latin American wildlife health program at the University of California, Davis, and an author of the new report. “We could be looking at a very high death toll.” This bird flu variant, which emerged in 2020, has caused enormous outbreaks on poultry farms, resulting in the deaths of nearly 60 million farmed birds in the United States alone. But unlike earlier versions of the virus, it has also spread widely in wild birds and routinely spilled over into wild mammals. The virus first appeared in South America in October 2022, spreading from Colombia down to Chile in just three months. “As soon as it started moving south, it did so very, very rapidly,” said Dr. Marcela Uhart, who directs the U.C. Davis Latin American wildlife health program and is an author of the OFFLU report. The casualties are difficult to tally because many infected animals were probably never detected, scientists said, and not all of the dead animals that did turn up were tested for the virus. But hundreds of thousands of dead seabirds, including boobies, cormorants and gulls, were reported in South America. The losses accounted for 36 percent of Peru’s population of Peruvian pelicans and 13 percent of Chile’s Humboldt penguins, according to the report. South American sea lions also died by the thousands, representing 9 percent of the population in Peru and Chile. (Scientists are still not sure exactly how marine mammals are contracting the virus or whether it is spreading readily among them.) The virus has continued to move south. In June, it turned up in a South American sea lion in the far south of Chile, just 670 miles from the Antarctic Peninsula. Some birds routinely wander between South America and Antarctica, feeding in both locations. Others will make their way to their Antarctic breeding sites as spring arrives in the Southern Hemisphere, potentially bringing the virus with them. Antarctica has never had an outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu before and its residents are likely to have few immune defenses against the virus. “The populations are completely naïve,” said Dr. Thijs Kuiken, a veterinary pathologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands and an author of the new report. “The worry is that the first time that it goes through, it will really have a high impact in terms of rate of mortality.” Many of the region’s birds, including emperor penguins and sooty shearwaters, are already facing other threats, from sources including climate change, the fishing industry or other human activities. Some species, like the southern pintail and the Macquarie shag, are restricted to just a few islands. “So if you were to get an outbreak in those islands, basically the whole species collapses,” Dr. Vanstreels said. Local marine mammals could be at risk, too. Although the Antarctic fur seal can range widely, 95 percent of the population lives around just one island, making it vulnerable to an outbreak. At this point, the virus is so widespread that it may not be possible to stop it from reaching Antarctica. “At the moment, there’s nothing we can do to prevent it,” Dr. Kuiken said. “So it’s important in the coming months to be as alert as possible.” It will be critical to monitor wild populations to learn more about how the virus is spreading, what species might be most at risk and what conservation actions might be needed to help them recover, scientists said. “What we’re trying to do is document this really well, trying to understand how the virus is moving to see how we can better protect the species going forward,” Dr. Uhart said.", "media_outlet": "NYTimes", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Over the last three years, a highly lethal form of avian influenza has whipped around the world, felling birds in Europe, Africa and Asia before jumping across the ocean and setting off the worst bird flu outbreak in United States history.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "But unlike earlier versions of the virus, it has also spread widely in wild birds and routinely spilled over into wild mammals.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "The virus first appeared in South America in October 2022, spreading from Colombia down to Chile in just three months.", "affirm_why_statement_4": "Some birds routinely wander between South America and Antarctica, feeding in both locations.

Medical experts have discovered that one variant of the avian flu virus, dubbed H3N8, has undergone several mutations and can now cause more severe infections. Additionally, the H3N8 virus - which is endemic among poultry farms throughout China - is transmissible by airborne droplets between animals that have no physical contact. \"Human populations, even when vaccinated - could be vulnerable to infection at epidemic or pandemic proportion,\" researchers wrote in the journal Cell. The H3N8 variant has been found in horses, dogs and seals as well as birds, but it has not made the leap into human populations - yet. In March, however, a woman in China became the first known human fatality of H3N8 avian flu. She likely became infected in a wet market, an open-air market where live animals are bought and sold. Such markets are considered by public health experts to be rich breeding grounds for cultivating potentially deadly viruses, bacteria and other infectious agents. The H3N8 avian flu virus is endemic among poultry in China and elsewhere. Future Publishing via Getty Images Last year, two boys were also infected with the H3N8 virus and survived. The new virus has a particular affinity for the cells in the human respiratory system. \"[A]n avian H3N8 virus isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia replicated efficiently in human bronchial and lung epithelial cells, was extremely harmful in its effects in laboratory mammalian hosts and could be passed on through respiratory droplets,\" study co-author professor Kin-Chow Chang, of the University of Nottingham, said in a news release. Avian flu viruses don't usually infect people, but there have been rare cases of human infection with these viruses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Wet markets, where live animals are bought and sold, are considered to be rich breeding grounds for cultivating potentially deadly viruses SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images In humans, bird flu infections range from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that can cause death. Person-to-person infection is very rare, and there have not been any widespread infections among humans. However, the CDC emphasizes, that avian flu viruses mutate and could gain the ability to spread easily between people. Therefore, monitoring for human infection and person-to-person spread is extremely important for public health. \"Acid resistance of influenza virus is - an important barrier for avian influenza virus to overcome to acquire the adaptability and transmissibility in new mammals or humans,\" the study authors wrote, referring to the protections afforded by acids in the immune system. \"The current novel H3N8 virus has not acquired the acid resistance yet.

{"id": "333", "title": "Avian flu is devastating National Trust seabird colonies, charity says", "date": "2023-09-10", "fulltext": "More than 7,000 birds have died this year at five of the trust's sites in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Avian flu has devastated seabird colonies at sites across England, Wales and Northern Ireland this year, the National Trust said, as it called on the government to coordinate detailed and long-term monitoring of the crisis. It said more than 7,000 seabirds had died of the disease at five of its sites in 2023. Only one of its sites was affected in 2022. 'It is absolutely devastating for these birds,' said Ben McCarthy, the trust's head of nature conservation and restoration ecology. 'It is really tough for the rangers. It is upsetting to see so much death around you.' He said that on the Farne Islands in Northumberland, 'quite literally a herring gull fell out of the sky beside me.' 'It is an extraordinary experience, really quite devastating, to see the scale of the mortality,' he said. McCarthy said avian flu had added to the extreme pressure seabirds were already under because of climate change. Government action on the disease was necessary, he said, but it had to be part of a bigger picture. 'We do need the government to take bolder, stronger and more urgent action around the existential challenges of things like climate change and the nature crisis,' he said. 'Very detailed and long-term monitoring of avian flu needed to be coordinated by the government and its agencies,' he said. The government had got off to a 'bit of a slow start,' he said. 'But we are now getting in sync with each other. My concern is that the effort is sustained.' McCarthy said the trust had released bleak, 'very depressing' figures for its sites. At Long Nanny in Northumberland, home to Britain's largest mainland colony of Arctic terns, James Porteus, an area ranger, said it was 'absolutely heartbreaking' to see so many birds die. Rangers began seeing signs of the disease in late June and have collected 1,066 dead Arctic tern chicks (roughly 40% of the population) and 263 adults (at least 8%). 'This year's losses could take years to recover from,' he said. 'And that's before we consider how this indiscriminate disease might impact the colony once again next year.' At the Farne Islands there were fewer dead birds than last year (down 39%), which Harriet Reid, also an area ranger, said was partly down to regular pick-ups. 'Removing the seabirds as soon as we find them does seem to have made a difference,' she said. 'But we do need to rapidly understand what more we can do to protect these precious seabirds.' Last year, guillemots and kittiwakes were most affected, she said. This year it is kittiwakes, large gulls and Arctic terns. At Cemlyn in north Wales, more than 1,200 dead birds were collected, of which 711 were Sandwich terns and the majority, 77%, were chicks. Chris Wynne, a senior reserves manager for the North Wales Wildlife Trust, said Cemlyn was one of the UK's most important sites for Sandwich terns. 'Last year our seabirds escaped bird flu, so it has been really distressing to see its impact here over the past few months.' In South Wales, on the Pembrokeshire coast, hundreds of dead birds were washed up in July because of avian flu. At Brownsea Island in Dorset, 650 Black-headed gulls, Common terns and Sandwich terns died with the vast majority being chicks or juveniles. In Northern Ireland, rangers collected 21 dead Common terns from Cockle Island, a breeding colony just off the coast, and more birds washed up at Cushendun, White Park Bay and Runkerry over the summer. A glimmer of good news comes from Blakeney Point on the north coast of Norfolk, home to an important breeding colony of Little terns. It appears to have escaped the disease with it being a 'good year' for a seabird that had previously been struggling due to foxes, rats and birds of prey as well as disturbance from people and dogs, the trust said. Christine Middlemiss, the UK's chief veterinary officer, said: 'We recognise that the current outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza poses a significant threat to the UK's wild bird populations and share the concerns about the impact on breeding populations, particularly seabirds that nest closely in large numbers.

{"id": "334", "title": "Gal�agos Islands tightens biosecurity as avian flu threatens unique species", "date": "2023-09-20", "fulltext": "Scientists confirm three birds have died from virus as park authorities redouble efforts to protect islands' endemic birds National park authorities on the Galápagos Islands have heightened biosecurity measures to protect the archipelago's unique fauna from the deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza after scientists confirmed that three birds had died from the virus. 'From preliminary tests of the five specimens, three of them have tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza,' Danny Rueda, director of the Galápagos national park told the Guardian. Two frigate birds and one red-footed booby were confirmed to have died from the virus on Tuesday, after samples were sent to Guayaquil on the Ecuadorian mainland for examination. Park guards and veterinarians are redoubling efforts to protect the islands' 58 species of endemic and native birds, including flightless cormorants, the only species of penguin in the northern hemisphere and one of the largest albatross colonies in the world. The Galápagos Islands' unique bird species were observed by Charles Darwin in 1835 when he visited the isolated archipelago on HMS Beagle and helped him set out his theory of evolution by natural selection in On the Origin of Species. They are considered particularly vulnerable due to their low immunity, small populations and the effect of rising ocean temperatures. Scientists say the virus was probably brought to the islands by migratory birds. Last year, Ecuador declared an emergency due to outbreaks of avian influenza on farms. In neighbouring Peru, the highly contagious virus ripped through seabird populations, killing as many as 200,000 as well as decimating marine mammals such as sea lions. The Galápagos national park activated emergency health protocols on Sunday following the report of dozens of dead and sick birds on two islands, Wolf and Genovesa, in the northern part of the Pacific archipelago, which lies about 1,000km from the South American continent. Rueda said red-footed boobies were showing a 'higher number of dead birds but also more symptoms [such as] erratic behaviour' characteristic of bird flu. Two visitor sites were closed on Española Island, the only place where the critically endangered waved albatross breeds, though there were no confirmed cases of the birds with the virus. 'Our main worry is for the endemic species,' said Rueda. 'Their populations are quite small and are restricted to the Galápagos.' 'It is very worrying to find a dead bird or a bird that has given a positive result, so we have to triple the biosecurity efforts on tourist boats, for tourists and crew members,' he said. Gustavo Jiménez, principal investigator for the Charles Darwin Foundation, said many species including boobies, albatross and the endangered Galápagos penguin were facing scarcer food sources due to El Niño, and the resulting stress made them more susceptible to pathogens such as avian flu. 'The endemic species are very sensitive to any disease,' he said. 'Our best defence is prevention.' Scientists also fear that, as it has on the mainland, the virus could jump to endangered Galápagos sea lions and fur seals. A warning has been issued calling on tourists visiting the Unesco Natural Heritage of Humanity site not to try to touch affected birds. Avian influenza can be transmitted to humans. Federico Angermeyer, a tour operator in the archipelago, said the disease's landfall could hurt tourism, the islands' principal economic activity.

{"id": "335", "title": "From cage-free chicks to puppy mills and Avian flu: Republicans are trying to roll back animal protections", "date": "2023-09-22", "fulltext": "A proposed federal law would wipe out existing state laws that prevent farm animal brutality and the spread of disease Many animals raised for meat in the US spend their lives in spaces barely bigger than their own bodies. Pregnant pigs are held in gestation crates so small they can only sit, stand or lie down in them. Chickens are packed into battery cages so crowded they often can't extend their wings. And calves raised for veal are packed into crates without enough room to turn around. While these conditions are part of what makes factory-farmed meat so cheap in the US, a growing number of consumers are rejecting these brutal practices, with more than a dozen states even enacting their own laws to ban them. But a new proposal in Congress would reverse these advances in animal welfare, threatening to upend years of work and victories by animal rights activists, farmers and food safety advocates. The Republican-led Ending Agricultural Trade Suppression, or Eats, Act aims to end the authority of states and localities to set animal welfare and food safety standards. If passed, it could also jeopardize more than 1,000 state and local health and safety laws that set food-quality requirements and stop the spread of invasive species and zoonotic diseases like avian flu. Experts say that legislation this extreme would ordinarily be unlikely to pass, but its supporters are pushing the Eats Act as part of this year's critical package of agriculture policies known as the farm bill, so there's a greater possibility of it becoming law. \"There's a longstanding precedent for states to legislate, to protect animals and to protect public health,\" said Alicia Prygoski, the legislative affairs manager at the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF). \"Congress shouldn't be destroying that. We should allow states to do what is in the best interest of their own residents.\" There's a long-standing precedent for states to protect animals and public health. Congress shouldn't be destroying that Alicia Prygoski There are no federal laws or standards for the treatment of farmed animals, so it's been up to states to create laws that protect animals. Massachusetts, for example, passed a law in 2016 that banned extreme confinement of farmed animals. In a public referendum, nearly 80% of voters approved a law banning the sale of meat or eggs from animals held in confined spaces, and legally required farmers in the state to give chickens, pigs and calves enough room to stand up, lie down, extend their limbs and turn around freely. These regulations also prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases and support small-scale farmers who raise meat in a sustainable way. In addition to Massachusetts, 15 other states, including California, Arizona and New Jersey, have implemented similar bans that the Eats Act would undo. If the Eats Act were to pass, it essentially would mean \"anything goes\" when it comes to regulating animal agriculture. It's just the latest effort by supporters of big agriculture to dismantle animal welfare regulations, experts say. Since California passed Proposition 12, which bans the sale of meat and eggs made from animals held in extreme confinement (including from animals raised in other states), the pork industry in particular has sought to overturn it. Last year the US supreme court agreed to hear the challenge which argued that the ban unfairly affects farmers in other states who want to sell their meat in California but ultimately upheld the constitutionality of California's law. After that defeat, groups like the National Pork Producers Council have turned their support to the Eats Act, which, if passed, would also invalidate Proposition 12. \"NPPC supports finding a legislative solution, like the Eats Act, to Proposition 12 to prevent state and local governments from interfering with the production of agricultural products in other states,\" the NPPC said in a public statement. Supporters also say laws regulating food production will drive up the cost of meat and eggs. By eliminating them, they argue, food will stay affordable. The National Pork Producers Council did not respond to requests for comment. The bill would leave states without the power to implement their own laws beyond federal regulation, said Kara Shannon, the director of farm animal welfare policy at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), which is leading a coalition opposing the Eats Act. \"There's nothing to protect these animals on farms, or even just slightly improve their lives.\" There's nothing to protect these animals on farms, or even just slightly improve their lives Kara Shannon The Eats Act would also jeopardize animal welfare laws protecting horses from slaughter, as well as those banning wildlife trafficking and puppy mills. In addition to animal welfare, the bill would also weaken protections for public health. Most states currently require pre-entry inspection and disease control measures for farm animals entering the state. In Iowa, for example, no animal that is infected with or has been recently exposed to a disease can enter the state. These measures were designed not only to protect animals, but also farmers from the devastating effects of zoonotic disease spread. The Eats Act would undermine farmers and businesses that treat animals humanely, said Chris Oliviero, the general manager of Niman Ranch, a network of more than 700 family farmers and ranchers across the country. \"We believe if you take care of a farmer, who in turn can take better care of the animal and allow them to exhibit natural behaviors, you can produce a better-tasting meat that aligns with what consumers truly think of when they feel that they're purchasing a higher attribute,\" Oliviero said. In August, more than 150 bipartisan House lawmakers signed a letter urging the House agriculture committee not to include the Eats Act in the 2023 farm bill. A group of 30 US senators signed a similar letter rejecting the Eats Act. \"The Eats Act would harm America's small farmers and infringe on the fundamental rights of states to establish laws and regulations within their own borders,\" the letter said.", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_3": "These measures were designed not only to protect animals, but also farmers from the devastating effects of zoonotic disease spread.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "If passed, it could also jeopardize more than 1,000 state and local health and safety laws that set food-quality requirements and stop the spread of invasive species and zoonotic diseases like avian flu.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "These regulations also prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases and support small-scale farmers who raise meat in a sustainable way.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "Most states currently require pre-entry inspection and disease control measures for farm animals entering the state.

{"id": "336", "title": "South Africa culls about 7.5 million chickens in an effort to contain bird flu outbreaks", "date": "2023-10-03", "fulltext": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South Africa has culled about 7.5 million chickens in an effort to contain dozens of outbreaks of two separate strains of avian influenza that threaten to create a shortage of eggs and poultry for consumers, the government and national poultry association said Tuesday. At least 205,000 chickens have died from bird flu in at least 60 separate outbreaks across the country, with more than half of those outbreaks in Gauteng province, which includes the country's biggest city, Johannesburg, and the capital, Pretoria. Some grocery stores in Johannesburg were limiting the number of eggs customers were allowed to buy this week — in some cases to one carton of six eggs — and the government acknowledged there were supply constraints. The government announced approximately 2.5 million chickens bred for their meat had been culled. The South African Poultry Association said another 5 million egg-laying chickens had been culled. The 7.5 million birds represented about 20-30% of South Africa's total chicken stock, South African Poultry Association general manager Izaak Breitenbach said. The government was moving to fast-track new import permits for companies to bring in eggs from other countries to ensure sufficient supplies for consumers, Agriculture Minister Thoko Didiza said. Her ministry is also considering embarking on a vaccination program to halt the bird flu outbreaks and said the number of farms with cases was increasing. Neighboring Namibia has banned chicken meat and egg imports from South Africa. The outbreaks are hitting an industry already struggling due to an electricity crisis. Breitenbach said South Africa has had three major bird flu outbreaks in recent years, and the latest ones were by far the worst, already costing the industry losses of at least $25 million. Vaccines would need to be imported and hopefully be ready to use in two to six months, he said. Wilhelm Mare, chairman of the poultry group in the South African Veterinary Association, said as many as 8.5 million egg-laying chickens could be affected and more than 10 million birds overall. It tells me we're going to have problems with this situation for quite a while, Mare said, calling it catastrophic for the industry. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month that bird flu outbreaks were on the rise globally, with more than 21,000 outbreaks across the world between 2013 and 2022. Bird flu only rarely infects humans. Eggs are an important and affordable source of protein in South Africa, but prices have risen steadily this year and the shortages caused by bird flu were expected to push prices up again and add to high food inflation for South Africans. The chicken industry in South Africa has already been hit hard this year by power shortages, which have resulted in planned regular electricity blackouts to save energy, but badly impacting businesses. South African farmers said in January they had been forced to cull nearly 10 million young chicks, as Africa's most advanced economy experienced record blackouts at the start of the year, causing production to slow dramatically and leading to overcrowding on chicken farms. The poultry industry has also lobbied the South African government to impose permanent duties on countries like Brazil, Denmark, Poland, Spain, and the United States for what the industry refers to as the dumping of cheap chicken products in South Africa, threatening local businesses.", "media_outlet": "AP", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "Bird flu only rarely infects humans.", "deny_transmissible_count": 1, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "337", "title": "How Do You Fight Bird Flu in France? Vaccinate 64 Million Ducks.", "date": "2023-10-05", "fulltext": "The inoculations are aimed at curbing the spread of a lethal strain of bird flu, and to support foie gras, a cherished delicacy. To protect its flocks and its foie gras from the ravages of bird flu, France has begun a mass vaccination of 64 million ducks. The campaign, which started this week, aims to prevent the spread of a deadly variant of avian influenza that has forced French farmers to cull more than 30 million birds in the past three years, contributing to a downturn in the production of foie gras. 'A real glimmer of hope,' Éric Dumas, a duck farmer and the president of France's foie gras federation, said in a statement after the agriculture minister, Marc Fesneau, visited his farm near Bordeaux to inaugurate the campaign. But the bird vaccination program, which Mr. Fesneau described as the first in the European Union, has led to a quick reaction from the United States, which said it would restrict imports of ducks and other poultry from Europe. 'France's decision to vaccinate presents a risk of introducing the disease into the United States,' the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In recent years the disease, known as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or HPAI, has spread through poultry farms across the globe, causing the deaths of nearly 60 million farmed birds in the United States alone. In France, farmers had already tried to counter the spread of the flu by adding health checks, reducing the density of birds on the farms and culling. In 2022, those efforts led to a 35 percent drop in the number of ducks available to produce foie gras compared with the year before, according to the foie gras committee. Marie Pierre Pé, the foie gras federation's director, said in a phone call that the vaccine program was fundamental for the farmers in her group. 'We've paid a heavy price for the avian flu,' she said. 'We are going to protect the animals.' Foie gras is the term for the liver of a duck or goose that has been fattened by forced feeding. For many the dish is a hallmark of French gastronomy; others say that the way it is produced constitutes torture and animal cruelty. The French government's vaccination program will be compulsory for farms that have more than 250 ducks, which taken together account for 64 million birds. That figure exceeds the number of people who received the coronavirus vaccine in France and, like many of the Covid vaccines, this one will also require two doses. The first vaccination shot will be administered to 10-day-old chicks, followed by a second one eight days later. The campaign, which will extend into next year, will be 'a real technical and financial challenge,' the foie gras federation said in a statement. Jocelyn Marguerie, an avian expert from France's national network of veterinarians working with farm animals, said his group had helped plan the program with the government. He said ducks had been picked because they catch the virus easily, and spread it fast. The government will cover 85 percent of the program's cost, at about 80 million euros (about $84 million). That is a fraction of the more than a billion the government paid in 2021 and 2022 to compensate farmers who had been required to cull their birds, according to a recent French parliamentary report. Public health authorities, concerned that bird flu could mutate into a version that can be transmitted to humans, have accelerated efforts to limit the outbreaks. The Agriculture Department's action was announced Sept. 29. The restriction covers imports of poultry, live ducks, duck eggs and untreated duck products from Europe. The announcement said the restriction stemmed from France's decision to vaccinate ducks, because vaccinated poultry may not show signs of bird flu, thus masking whether the virus is circulating. The French Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement that talks between the two countries had begun 'to provide all the elements of reassurance which will allow the American restrictions to be quickly lifted.' Ms. Pé said the ban would not hurt French foie gras producers, because they do not have a license to export to the United States. Mr. Marguerie, the avian vet, said that veterinarians would also still be deployed to ensure that no contamination occurs despite the vaccinations, taking random swabs of the ducks.

Laboratory tests confirmed that the girl, who lived in the southeastern province of Prey Veng, died Monday with H5N1 avian influenza, the ministry said in a statement. The ministry had announced on Sunday that a 50-year-old man in neighboring Svay Rieng province also had died from bird flu. In February, an 11-year-old girl became the country's first bird flu fatality since 2014. Her father was also found to be infected but survived. According to a global tally by the U.N.'s World Health Organization, from January 2003 to July 2023, there have been 878 cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza reported from 23 countries, 458 of them fatal. Cambodia had recorded 58 cases since 2003 of humans infected with bird flu. Since 2003, this virus has spread in bird populations from Asia to Europe and Africa, and to the Americas in 2021, and has become endemic in poultry populations in many countries, the WHO says on its website. Outbreaks have resulted in millions of poultry infections, several hundred human cases and many human deaths. Human cases have been reported mostly from countries in Asia, but also from countries in Africa, the Americas and Europe. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month that bird flu outbreaks were on the rise globally, with more than 21,000 outbreaks across the world between 2013 and 2022.

Scientists worry that rising cases of H5N1, particularly in animals that have frequent contact with humans, might lead to a mutated version of the disease that could spread easily between people, triggering another pandemic. Chhuon Srey Mao, the 22-year-old mother of the dead girl, told The Associated Press by phone from Chhmar Lort village that her daughter fell sick on Oct. 1 with symptoms of coughing, high temperature and vomiting. The girl received treatment from a local physician for five days, but was sent on Oct. 5 to the capital Phnom Penh for advanced care when her condition worsened. She died at the children's hospital. The mother said that from late September, several chickens in her village, including at least four of her own, had died. She added that she had discarded the chickens that died, not cooking them for food. People have caught the virus both from domestic fowl and from wild birds such as ducks. I have no idea why my daughter would contract bird flu because she never touched or ate the dead chickens, Chhuon Srey Mao said, but I presume that she may have become infected with the virus when she played in the yard, as she normally did, where the chickens had been.

{"id": "339", "title": "Deadly bird flu reappears in US commercial poultry flocks in Utah and South Dakota", "date": "2023-10-10", "fulltext": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Highly pathogenic bird flu has made its first appearances in U.S. commercial poultry flocks this season, affecting one turkey farm in South Dakota and one in Utah and raising concerns that more outbreaks could follow. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that avian influenza, which is deadly to commercial poultry, was confirmed in a flock of 47,300 turkeys in Jerauld County, South Dakota, on Oct. 4 and at a farm with 141,800 birds in Utah's Sanpete County last Friday. The outbreaks are the first reported among commercial flocks in the U.S. since the disease struck two turkey farms in the Dakotas in April. Infected flocks are normally destroyed to prevent the flu's spread, and then the farms are decontaminated. Before last week, the only reports of bird flu in recent months in the U.S. in recent months were sporadic appearances in backyard flocks or among wild birds such as ducks, geese and eagles. While wild birds often show no symptoms of avian influenza, infections in them are a concern to the poultry industry because migrating birds can spread the disease to vulnerable commercial flocks. “I don’t doubt that we will have more cases,\" South Dakota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said in an interview Tuesday. “I would be very pleasantly surprised if we're done because migration is just starting.\" Bird flu last year cost U.S. poultry producers nearly 59 million birds across 47 states, including egg-laying chickens and turkeys and chickens raised for meat, making it the country's deadliest outbreak ever, according to USDA figures. The outbreak caused spikes in egg and turkey prices for consumers and cost the government over $660 million. The toll from a 2015 outbreak, deemed the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history with over $1 billion in costs to the government, was nearly 51 million birds in 15 states. Bird flu infections in humans are relatively rare and aren’t considered a food safety risk. But as it hits other species, including some mammals, scientists fear the virus could evolve to spread more easily among people. Cambodia this week reported its third human death from bird flu this year. Agriculture officials consider this year's cases to be part of last year's outbreak, which reached the U.S. in February 2022 after spreading in Europe. The U.S. has imposed periodic restrictions on poultry imports from Europe to limit the potential for spread. Thompson said the virus never completely went away, unlike in 2015, and that the version now circulating is essentially the same that spread last year. “We're just encouraging bird owners to make sure they're increasing their biosecurity practices because avian flu is still out there and it's easy to contract,\" said Bailee Woolstenhulme, spokesperson for the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food. However, producers have kept their biosecurity tight for several years, and there is little more that farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out of their flocks. The main strategy is to prevent droppings of wild birds from being tracked into poultry barns on workers' footwear and clothing, or from hitchhiking on farm equipment, mice, small birds and even dust particles. This was Utah’s first case this year, Woolstenhulme said, but 16 turkey farms, one egg farm and several backyard flocks were affected in the state last year. South Dakota producers lost nearly 4 million birds last year. Iowa, the hardest-hit state, with nearly 16 million birds lost, hasn't recorded a case since March.

{"id": "340", "title": "Scientists Use CRISPR to Make Chickens More Resistant to Bird Flu", "date": "2023-10-10", "fulltext": "A new study highlights both the promise and the limitations of gene editing, as a highly lethal form of avian influenza continues to spread around the world. Scientists have used the gene-editing technology known as CRISPR to create chickens that have some resistance to avian influenza, according to a new study that was published in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday. The study suggests that genetic engineering could potentially be one tool for reducing the toll of bird flu, a group of viruses that pose grave dangers to both animals and humans. But the study also highlights the limitations and potential risks of the approach, scientists said. Some breakthrough infections still occurred, especially when gene-edited chickens were exposed to very high doses of the virus, the researchers found. And when the scientists edited just one chicken gene, the virus quickly adapted. The findings suggest that creating flu-resistant chickens will require editing multiple genes and that scientists will need to proceed carefully to avoid driving further evolution of the virus, the study's authors said. The research is 'proof of concept that we can move toward making chickens resistant to the virus,' Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London and an author of the study, said at a news briefing. 'But we're not there yet.' Some scientists who were not involved in the research had a different takeaway. 'It's an excellent study,' said Dr. Carol Cardona, an expert on bird flu and avian health at the University of Minnesota. But to Dr. Cardona, the results illustrate how difficult it will be to engineer a chicken that can stay a step ahead of the flu, a virus known for its ability to evolve swiftly. 'There's no such thing as an easy button for influenza,' Dr. Cardona said. 'It replicates quickly, and it adapts quickly.' Avian influenza refers to a group of flu viruses that are adapted to spread in birds. Over the last several years, a highly lethal version of a bird flu virus known as H5N1 has spread rapidly around the globe, killing countless farmed and wild birds. It has also repeatedly infected wild mammals and been detected in a small number of people. Although the virus remains adapted to birds, scientists worry that it could acquire mutations that help it spread more easily among humans, potentially setting off a pandemic. Many nations have tried to stamp out the virus by increasing biosecurity on farms, quarantining infected premises and culling infected flocks. But the virus has become so widespread in wild birds that it has proved impossible to contain, and some nations have begun vaccinating poultry, although that endeavor presents some logistic and economic challenges. If scientists could engineer resistance into chickens, farmers would not need to routinely vaccinate new batches of birds. Gene editing 'promises a new way to make permanent changes in the disease resistance of an animal,' Mike McGrew, an embryologist at the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute and an author of the new study, said at the briefing. 'This can be passed down through all the gene-edited animals, to all the offspring.' CRISPR, the gene-editing technology used in the study, is a molecular tool that allows scientists to make targeted edits in DNA, changing the genetic code at a precise point in the genome. In the new study, the researchers used this approach to tweak a chicken gene that codes for a protein known as ANP32A, which the flu virus hijacks to copy itself. The tweaks were designed to prevent the virus from binding to the protein and therefore keep it from replicating inside chickens. The edits did not appear to have negative health consequences for the chickens, the researchers said. 'We observed that they were healthy, and that the gene-edited hens also laid eggs normally,' said Dr. Alewo Idoko-Akoh, who conducted the research as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh. The researchers then sprayed a dose of flu virus into the nasal cavities of 10 chickens that had not been genetically edited, to serve as the control. (The researchers used a mild version of the virus different from the one that has been causing major outbreaks in recent years.) All of the control chickens were infected with the virus, which they then transmitted to other control chickens they were housed with. When the researchers administered flu virus directly into the nasal cavities of 10 gene-edited chickens, just one of the birds became infected. It had low levels of the virus and did not pass the virus on to other gene-edited birds. 'But having seen that, we felt that it would be the responsible thing to be more rigorous, to stress test this and ask, 'Are these chickens truly resistant?'' Dr. Barclay said. 'What if they were to somehow encounter a much, much higher dose?' When the scientists gave the gene-edited chickens a flu dose that was 1,000 times higher, half of the birds became infected. The researchers found, however, that they generally shed lower levels of the virus than control chickens exposed to the same high dose. The researchers then studied samples of the virus from the gene-edited birds that had been infected. These samples had several notable mutations, which appeared to allow the virus to use the edited ANP32A protein to replicate, they found. Some of these mutations also helped the virus replicate better in human cells, although the researchers noted that those mutations in isolation would not be enough to create a virus that was well adapted to humans. Seeing those mutations is 'not ideal,' said Richard Webby, who is a bird flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and was not involved in the research. 'But when you get to the weeds of these particular changes, then it doesn't concern me quite so much.' The mutated flu virus was also able to replicate even in the complete absence of the ANP32A protein by using two other proteins in the same family, the researchers found. When they created chicken cells that lacked all three of these proteins, the virus was not able to replicate. Those chicken cells were also resistant to the highly lethal version of H5N1 that has been spreading around the world the last several years. The researchers are now working to create chickens with edits in all three of the genes for the protein family. The big question, Dr. Webby said, was whether chickens with edits in all three genes would still develop normally and grow as fast as poultry producers needed. But the idea of gene editing chickens had enormous promise, he said. 'Absolutely, we're going to get to a point where we can manipulate the host genome to make them less susceptible to flu,' he said. 'That'll be a win for public health.'

{"id": "341", "title": "To protect chickens from bird flu, researchers try to CRISPR in immunity", "date": "2023-10-10", "fulltext": "LONDON—In this case, it was neither the chicken nor the egg that came first. Rather, it started with some specially engineered cells in a lab. The chicken cells had had their genomes edited, not to correct a faulty mutation, but in an effort to blunt the bird flu virus. The chickens that were bred from those cells were designed to be resistant to the infection. The experiment was a sign of the times. A highly pathogenic strain of that flu has swept to nearly every corner of the globe in recent years and left an unprecedented wave of death in its wake, decimating both wild and farmed birds and tipping into mammals as well. While farmers trying to protect poultry have turned to isolating farmed birds from wild birds—no more ranging free for those chickens—and, increasingly, to vaccination, scientists in the U.K. on Tuesday offered up the idea of stitching immunity to influenza into chickens’ DNA. In a way, the research is an extension of humanity’s long history of enhancing certain traits in crops and farm animals, though with a decidedly 21st-century twist. In the paper, published in Nature Communications, the researchers described using the genome-editor CRISPR to alter a protein in chicken cells that flu hijacks to make copies of itself. If the virus can’t take over that protein, the idea goes, it can’t establish an infection. The results were promising: Almost all the chickens with the edited protein rebuffed a level of virus that the research team said approximated the flu exposure a chicken would encounter from a sick coop-mate or an infected wild bird drawn to a fowl farm to pilfer some feed. The edited chickens showed no health or developmental issues and laid eggs in typical numbers. Related: Bird flu researchers turn to Finland’s mink farms, tracking a virus with pandemic potential. But the researchers set themselves a higher bar, and tested an extremely high dose of flu that caused a number of breakthrough infections in the CRISPR’d chickens. Out of concern that any virus that managed to circumvent the CRISPR’d immunity could harbor potentially dangerous mutations, the scientists said they wanted to demonstrate complete infection protection in the birds even against such high levels of flu before attempting to roll them out. To reach that threshold, the researchers are now pursuing further experiments that involve editing three genes, not just one. “We felt that it would be the responsible thing to be more rigorous to stress test this and ask, are these chickens truly resistant?” said Imperial College London virologist Wendy Barclay, one of the senior authors on the paper. “What if they were to somehow encounter a much, much higher dose?” With additional research needed, the paper is more proof of concept than immediate proposal, but the authors were already thinking about whether people would consider frying up some tenders or scrambling some eggs from an edited bird. As it is, genetically modified crops and animals continue to face resistance among some groups. “It’s not just enough to develop the technology,” said Alewo Idoko-Akoh, the first author of the paper and a research associate at the University of Bristol, who used to work as a veterinarian in his native Nigeria. “It’s got to be done in such a way that it’s culturally sensitive and also acceptable.” No chicken has been found to be naturally immune to the H5N1 avian flu strain that’s been spreading across the world; it’s not as if chicken farms could selectively breed for such a trait. Instead, scientists at the University of Edinburgh where Idoko-Akoh formerly worked got the idea of CRISPR’ing it in. For their target, they selected the ANP32 family of genes that encode proteins that Barclay and her group have shown are essential for flu to make copies of itself inside cells. “It occurred to us that if you could disrupt that interaction in some way, if you could prevent the protein from being used, perhaps by this gene editing, then the virus would not be able to replicate,” Barclay said. Specifically, the researchers used CRISPR to make tiny tweaks to the ANP32A gene. They performed the edits in the lab in cells that go on to form eggs and sperm, and then injected those cells into chicken embryos developing in eggs. The embryos took up the edited cells, went on to hatch, and then those chickens were later mated with each other. All their offspring, in turn, inherited the edited ANP32A gene. The researchers then put their CRISPR’d chickens up against regular birds as they exposed them to flu. (For the experiments, the researchers didn’t use H5N1, but rather a less pathogenic bird flu called H9N2.) In their first test, they challenged the birds with a level of virus—1,000 infectious units—that they estimated replicated what the birds would encounter during a farm outbreak. While all of the control birds were infected, nine out of 10 of the edited birds were able to block infection. The tenth shed comparatively little virus for a short period of time, the researchers reported. In the next round, the researchers tried an extremely high flu dose—1 million infectious units. All the control birds were infected, but this time, half of the edited chickens were also infected, though they had lower viral levels and were less likely to transmit the virus on than the control birds. The researchers said it wasn’t clear exactly how the virus was able to infect the edited birds, but sequencing showed the viruses from the breakthrough infections had picked up some mutations. The fear is that if a gene-edited approach to blunting bird flu can’t prevent infections entirely, it could pressure the virus to evolve in ways that could make it a better spreader than it already is, particularly among mammals. Experts have worried about H5N1 spreading among people and igniting a pandemic since the virus was discovered 25 years ago, and though it would take multiple changes to the virus’s genome to do that, scientists want to make sure they’re not boosting it even one rung up that ladder. “If this was a disease that only infected chickens, yes, then the resistance we created would be better than what we would get with a vaccine,” said Mike McGrew, a senior author on the paper and a group leader at the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute. “But because this is a zoonotic disease, and can be spread potentially to humans, we really need to aim for complete resistance. Not resilience, resistance, so the virus cannot grow in the chickens.” In an effort to generate sterilizing immunity—that is, blocking infections entirely—the researchers are now experimenting with editing a total of three genes in the ANP32 family. Their lab tests have shown the combined approach generates stronger protection, though they haven’t yet made chickens with the edits for further testing as well as to make sure the edits don’t have any health impacts on the chickens. Benjamin Schusser, a professor of reproductive biotechnology at the Technical University of Munich, who was not involved with the new research, said he agreed with the paper’s authors that they needed to demonstrate sterilizing immunity before the chickens could ever be used. Having viruses that pick up mutations as they cause breakthrough infections “gets dangerous, for animals and for humans.” “This is a great piece of work showing there might be ways to do it, but it requires much more research to do it,” Schusser said. The researchers, who have submitted a patent application on the work, framed the gene-editing strategy as an alternative to vaccination. While some governments have grown receptive to vaccination campaigns as the toll of bird flu mounts, some have resisted out of concerns that immunizing birds could render them asymptomatic, but not protected from infection. The fear is that the virus would spread without notice, or that an infected bird could unknowingly be imported by another country. France, for example, recently started vaccinating millions of ducks, and the United States responded by restricting imports of the birds. Vaccines face other limitations. Flu viruses evolve quickly, so they could mutate in ways that allow them to outrun vaccine-generated protection. If the CRISPR approach were proven out, experts say integrating the protective edits into the world’s billions of chickens would be feasible, though it could take some time. A small number of breeding companies supply much of the world’s Gallus gallus domesticus, so it would involve introducing the edits to the pedigree birds at the top of the companies’ “breeding pyramids,” and then waiting as the trait passed down through future generations. The U.K. team is not alone in exploring the use of CRISPR in farm animals to protect them from diseases or adapt them to changing climates. Already, Czech researchers in 2020 described CRISPR’ing chickens to make them resistant to avian leukosis virus. “I definitely see it as an extension of breeding tools,” Irina Polejaeva, a professor of developmental biology at Utah State University, who was not involved in the new research, said about gene editing. “Spontaneous natural mutations responsible for specific traits were identified over the previous centuries and amplified by selective breeding, leading to a generation of specialized livestock and poultry breeds. Gene editing is a new high-precision tool that can introduce specific beneficial traits.” Lawmakers and regulators around the world are starting to think more about how to handle these technologies. In the U.S., regulators have cleared CRISPR’d cows with shorter hair to help them withstand higher temperatures; there are also genetically engineered salmon and pigs on the market. The U.K. passed legislation earlier this year that opens the door to gene-edited crops and livestock. Japan has authorized the sale of CRISPR’d fish as food. “I think the world is changing,” said Helen Sang of the University of Edinburgh, another author on the new paper. “Countries are bringing in new legislation to bring in regulations that will look at the safety of gene-edited animals for food, and within a few years, there will be the regulations in place.

{"id": "342", "title": "Super-chickens to the rescue: Scientists show how CRISPR gene editing can combat bird flu", "date": "2023-10-10", "fulltext": "The chicken may be getting an upgrade. In a scientific first, U.K. researchers have used gene editing technology to create poultry that's partially resistant to bird flu infection, according to a study published Tuesday in Nature Communications. It's no bionic chicken. But study authors say growing disease-resistant chickens in the lab is an important first step to giving farmers a tool to combat bird flu, which wiped out tens of millions of chickens amid an H5N1 outbreak over the past two years. Though experts say gene editing in poultry could have many benefits, they also warn that more research must be done to prevent possible unintended consequences. It's still very early stages in terms of getting this up and running to chickens worldwide, but it's a really neat first step, said Ceili Peng, a doctoral student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is working to encode heritable resistance to diseases in animals. But Peng is aware of the consequences of pushing forward too quickly. It's definitely worth exploring some of the consequences of our genetic edits. How does it work? Scientists in the study made the genetic changes to germ cells and injected the gene-edited cells into chicken eggs. The gene they edited, called ANP32A, is a protein that supports the influenza virus once it invades the host cell, study author Wendy Barclay said at a media briefing last week. Scientists aimed to prevent the virus from using this gene to replicate. This strategy could be used not just for H5N1 (bird flu virus) but for any of the strains because it's fundamental to the way the virus works, she said. The germinated eggs grew into adult chickens, which scientists bred with others to generate more gene-edited chickens while monitoring the flock's growth, behavior and health. Once they determined the edited gene did not hurt the chickens' growth, they sent the flightless birds to a containment facility to test their resistance to bird flu. Researchers infected both gene-edited and regular chickens with a low dose of the bird flu virus and allowed them to interact with one another in the facility. They found the gene-edited chickens were almost entirely resistant to infection. The results are pretty cool, said Peng, who is unaffiliated with the study. Benefits to flu-resistant chickens The resources farmers have on hand to prevent bird flu infection are pretty limited, experts say. Farmers could increase biosecurity by keeping poultry inside, instead of allowing them to roam free, to prevent contact with infected wild birds. They also could vaccinate the entire flock, but that can be time-consuming, costly and less effective against the latest bird flu strain, said Dr. Meghan Schaeffer, a zoonotic influenza epidemiologist. In theory, study authors say, gene editing should protect against any type of flu strain, prevent infection and eradicate transmission among domesticated chickens. It could save... chickens' lives, an enormous amount of money and not interrupt the food supply, said Schaeffer, who is also the national public health adviser for SAS, a statistical programming company for epidemiologists and data scientists. Protecting poultry also drastically reduces the risk of transmitting the bird flu virus to mammals, including possibly to humans, experts say. The transmission of the disease across species became a growing concern in the most recent bird flu outbreak when it began spilling over into wild animals, including otters, seals and foxes, among others. You take a major player out of the picture if you deal with domestic poultry, Schaeffer said. Possible unintended consequences As with all technological advances, experts warn of unintended consequences and one such consequence may have already been detected in the study released Tuesday. Scientists who exposed the gene-edited poultry to a higher dose of bird flu virus — a million units rather than 1,000 — reported a breakthrough infection in half the chickens. When researchers looked at the virus that had sickened half of their birds, they realized it had already mutated in the chickens. The mutations didn't appear harmful when introduced to human cells in the lab, but experts said more menacing mutations could sprout. We do have to be very vigilant as a field because evolution is really powerful, Peng said. She also stressed the importance of studying how gene-edited chickens could affect the environment and ecosystems. Making poultry resistant to certain diseases could give them a fitness advantage Mother Nature did not intend. A long road ahead There's more work to be done before flu-resistant chickens become a viable option for farmers. One reason is that study authors tested a common but a less pathogenic bird flu strain, H9N2, not the H5N1 strain that wreaked havoc in birds around the world. Researchers said in last week's briefing the latest strain was tested on new cells in the lab and had favorable results, but they have yet to infect the highly transmissible strain into chickens. Experts also said more research is needed to learn how consuming gene-edited chicken could affect people, Peng said. On a broader scale, the federal government will first have to figure out how to regulate gene-edited animal products before Americans can start ordering up flu-resistant chicken wings.

{"id": "343", "title": "Deadly bird flu detected in US commercial poultry flocks in Utah, South Dakota", "date": "2023-10-10", "fulltext": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture detected traces of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry flocks in South Dakota and Utah on Friday, raising concerns about possible future outbreaks across the country. So far, virus detections in 328 commercial flocks and 516 backyard flocks in the U.S. have affected 58.97 million birds nationwide. Backyard flocks are residences that keep 1,000 or fewer birds, whereas commercial flocks exceed that amount, according to the USDA. On Oct. 4, officials in South Dakota confirmed the presence of bird flu among a commercial turkey flock in Jerauld County. More than 47,000 poultry were believed to be affected by the outbreak and will have to be culled. Infected flocks are killed to prevent the spread of the virus. 'I don't doubt that we will have more cases,' South Dakota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson told The Associated Press. 'I would be very pleasantly surprised if we're done because migration is just starting.' Two days later, officials identified another infected commercial flock of 134,200 turkeys in Sanpete County, Utah. The detections are the first cases of bird flu in a U.S. commercial flock since April when the virus was confirmed in a Beadle County turkey farm with more than 75,000 birds and a 58,500-head turkey farm in North Dakota on the same day. Before the October cases, the only recent reports of bird flu in the U.S. were sporadic in backyard flocks or among wild birds, according to the AP. While wild birds often show no symptoms of avian influenza, infections in them are a concern to the poultry industry because migrating birds can spread the disease to vulnerable commercial flocks. Super-chickens to the rescue: Scientists show how CRISPR gene editing can combat bird flu Bird flu in the Dakotas The virus was detected in three commercial bird farms in South Dakota this year, and producers have depopulated more than 123,000 birds. Since the start of the current outbreak, more than 4 million birds have been impacted in the state. Virus detections in South Dakota tend to affect commercial flocks smaller than 100,000 birds, but Flandreau-based Dakota Layers, a commercial egg-laying operation, was forced to cull 1.35 million hens in December after bird flu was detected on the premises, which made it the 13th highest depopulation event since the start of the current outbreak. Bird flu proved more devastating to South Dakota poultry farms in 2022. According to The Argus Leader, bird flu affected more than 3.96 million birds last year, more than double the number of flu-hit South Dakota poultry during the 2014 to 2015 outbreak. Can humans get bird flu? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says bird flu primarily strikes animals, but it has been detected in at least four human cases in the United States. An 11-year-old girl died of the flu in Cambodia in late February, and the country reported its third human death this year due to the virus, according to AP. The viruses circulating in birds in the United States are believed to be low risk to people, but those working with birds should take appropriate precautions, the CDC recommends. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation's food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses, officials said. Since January 2022, 11 cases of H5N1 have been reported in people. The first 10 were exposed to poultry. Symptoms of the illness, according to the CDC, include eye redness, flu-like upper respiratory symptoms that range from mild to severe, fever, and body aches. Avian flu costs the U.S. millions The ongoing bird flu outbreak has cost the government roughly $660 million and added to consumers' pain at the grocery store after more than 58 million birds were slaughtered earlier this year to limit the spread of the virus. This is the country's deadliest outbreak, according to USDA figures. 50.6 million birds across 15 states were affected in the U.S. during the 2014 to 2015 outbreak, according to the USDA. The events were deemed the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history with the government paying over $1 billion to deal with the infected birds and to decontaminate farms, AP reported. The recent outbreak has cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn't have any birds on their farms. Agriculture officials consider this year's cases to be part of last year's outbreak, which reached the U.S. in February 2022 after spreading in Europe. The U.S. has imposed periodic restrictions on poultry imports from Europe to limit the potential for spread. Thompson said the virus never completely went away, unlike in 2015, and that the version now circulating is essentially the same that spread last year. 'We're just encouraging bird owners to make sure they're increasing their biosecurity practices because avian flu is still out there and it's easy to contract,' said Bailee Woolstenhulme, spokesperson for the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food.

They also could vaccinate the entire flock, but that can be time-consuming, costly and less effective against the latest bird flu strain, said Dr. Meghan Schaeffer, a zoonotic influenza epidemiologist. In theory, study authors say, gene editing should protect against any type of flu strain, prevent infection and eradicate transmission among domesticated chickens. \"It could save... chickens' lives, an enormous amount of money and not interrupt the food supply,\" said Schaeffer, who is also the national public health adviser for SAS, a statistical programming company for epidemiologists and data scientists. Protecting poultry also drastically reduces the risk of transmitting the bird flu virus to mammals, including possibly to humans, experts say. The transmission of the disease across species became a growing concern in the most recent bird flu outbreak when it began spilling over into wild animals, including otters, seals and foxes, among others. \"You take a major player out of the picture if you deal with domestic poultry,\" Schaeffer said. Unintended consequences? As with all technological advances, experts warn of unintended consequences and one such consequence may have already been detected in the study released Tuesday. Scientists who exposed the gene-edited poultry to a higher dose of bird flu virus — a million units rather than 1,000 — reported a breakthrough infection in half the chickens. When researchers looked at the virus that had sickened half of their birds, they realized it had already mutated in the chickens. The mutations didn't appear harmful when introduced to human cells in the lab, but experts said more menacing mutations could sprout. \"We do have to be very vigilant as a field because evolution is really powerful,\" Peng said. She also stressed the importance of studying how gene-edited chickens could affect the environment and ecosystems. Making poultry resistant to certain diseases could give them a fitness advantage Mother Nature did not intend. A long road ahead There's more work to be done before flu-resistant chickens become a viable option for farmers. One reason is that the study's authors tested a common but a less pathogenic bird flu strain, H9N2, not the H5N1 strain that wreaked havoc in birds around the world. Researchers said in last week's briefing the latest strain was tested on new cells in the lab and had favorable results, but they have yet to infect the highly transmissible strain into chickens. Experts also said more research is needed to learn how consuming gene-edited chicken could affect people, Peng said. On a broader scale, the federal government will first have to figure out how to regulate gene-edited animal products before Americans can start ordering up flu-resistant chicken wings.

{"id": "345", "title": "Bird flu found in commercial poultry flocks; Virus detected in Utah and South Dakota", "date": "2023-10-12", "fulltext": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture detected traces of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry flocks in South Dakota and Utah on Friday, raising concerns about possible future outbreaks across the country. So far, virus detections in 328 commercial flocks and 516 backyard flocks in the U.S. have affected 58.97 million birds nationwide. Backyard flocks are residences that keep 1,000 or fewer birds, while commercial flocks exceed that amount, according to the USDA. On Oct. 4, officials in South Dakota confirmed the presence of bird flu among a commercial turkey flock in Jerauld County. More than 47,000 poultry were believed to be affected by the outbreak and will have to be culled. Infected flocks are killed to prevent the spread of the virus. \"I don't doubt that we will have more cases,\" South Dakota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson told The Associated Press. \"I would be very pleasantly surprised if we're done because migration is just starting.\" Two days later, officials identified another infected commercial flock of 134,200 turkeys in Sanpete County, Utah. The detections are the first cases of bird flu in a U.S. commercial flock since April when the virus was confirmed in a Beadle County turkey farm with more than 75,000 birds and a 58,500-head turkey farm in North Dakota on the same day. Before the October cases, the only recent reports of bird flu in the U.S. were sporadic in backyard flocks or among wild birds, according to the AP. While wild birds often show no symptoms of avian influenza, infections in them are a concern to the poultry industry because migrating birds can spread the disease to vulnerable commercial flocks. Bird flu in the Dakotas The virus was detected in three commercial bird farms in South Dakota this year, and producers have depopulated more than 123,000 birds. Since the start of the current outbreak, more than 4 million birds have been impacted in the state. Virus detections in South Dakota tend to affect commercial flocks smaller than 100,000 birds, but Flandreau-based Dakota Layers, a commercial egg-laying operation, was forced to cull 1.35 million hens in December after bird flu was detected on the premises, which made it the 13th highest depopulation event since the start of the current outbreak. Bird flu proved more devastating to South Dakota poultry farms in 2022. According to The Argus Leader, bird flu affected more than 3.96 million birds last year, more than double the number of flu-hit South Dakota poultry during the 2014 to 2015 outbreak. Can humans get bird flu? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says bird flu primarily strikes animals, but it has been detected in at least four human cases in the United States. An 11-year-old girl died of the flu in Cambodia in late February, and the country reported its third human death this year due to the virus, the AP says. The viruses circulating in birds in the United States are believed to be low risk to people, but those working with birds should take appropriate precautions, the CDC recommends. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation's food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses, officials said. Since January 2022, 11 cases of H5N1 have been reported in people. The first 10 were exposed to poultry. Symptoms of the illness, according to the CDC, include eye redness, flulike upper respiratory symptoms that range from mild to severe, fever, and body aches. Avian flu costs the US millions The ongoing bird flu outbreak has cost the government roughly $660 million and added to consumers' pain at the grocery store after more than 58 million birds were slaughtered earlier this year to limit the spread of the virus. This is the country's deadliest outbreak, according to USDA figures. About 50.6 million birds across 15 states were affected in the U.S. during the 2014 to 2015 outbreak, according to the USDA. The events were deemed the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history with the government paying over $1 billion to deal with the infected birds and to decontaminate farms, AP reported. The recent outbreak has cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn't have any birds on their farms. Agriculture officials consider this year's cases to be part of last year's outbreak, which reached the U.S. in February 2022 after spreading in Europe. The U.S. has imposed periodic restrictions on poultry imports from Europe to limit the potential for spread. Thompson said the virus never completely went away, unlike in 2015, and that the version now circulating is essentially the same that spread last year. \"We're just encouraging bird owners to make sure they're increasing their biosecurity practices because avian flu is still out there and it's easy to contract,\" said Bailee Woolstenhulme, spokesperson for the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food.

{"id": "346", "title": "New vaccine expected to give endangered California condors protection against deadly bird flu", "date": "2023-10-16", "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES (AP) Antibodies found in early results of a historic new vaccine trial are expected to give endangered California condors at least partial protection from the deadliest strain of avian influenza in U.S. history. The California condor is the only bird species in the U.S. that has been approved for the new emergency-use vaccine, which was administered this summer to condors bred in captivity during a trial at the Los Angeles Zoo, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park and the Oregon Zoo. Authorities launched the study after the avian influenza deaths earlier this year of 21 free-flying condors in Arizona, part of a Southwest flock usually accounting for a third of the wild population. Wildlife officials feared that the outbreak's toll on the California condor population could erase any gains made to rebuild the wild population, spurring the efforts to fast-track the vaccine. After 40 years of recovery efforts to prevent the extinction of the iconic vulture with a 10-foot (3-meter) wingspan, the wild population today has fewer than 350 condors in flocks spanning from the Pacific Northwest to Baja California, Mexico. \"Losing 20 birds is effectively akin to setting the recovery program back by 10 years,\" said Dr. Hendrik Nollens, vice president of wildlife health for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. The so-called bird flu reached the U.S. in February 2022 after wreaking havoc across Europe. U.S. agriculture officials consider this year's cases to be part of last year's outbreak, which was recorded as the country's deadliest ever. Authorities confirmed the flu's presence earlier this month in commercial poultry flocks in South Dakota and Utah, heightening concerns ahead of the spring migratory season. The outbreak cost poultry producers nearly 59 million birds across 47 states, including egg-laying chickens and turkeys and chickens raised for meat. The flu also caused spikes in egg and turkey prices for consumers and cost the federal government more than $660 million. Early results indicate that when 10 condors were vaccinated with half a milliliter (0.016 fluid ounces) on two occasions — an initial injection and a booster administered 21 days later — 90% of the birds showed measurable antibodies expected to protect them from avian flu after exposure. \"We're thankful that we're getting any immune response,\" said Ashleigh Blackford, the California condor coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The population was nearly wiped out by hunting during the California Gold Rush in the mid-1800s, as well as by poisoning from toxic pesticide DDT and lead ammunition. In the 1980s, only 22 California condors were left in the wild. They were captured and placed in captive breeding programs to save the species. Zoo-bred birds were first released into the wild in 1992 and in the years since have been reintroduced into habitats from which they had disappeared. The ongoing re-wilding efforts are considered a conservation success. The bird flu trial's progress will allow wildlife officials to move forward and release roughly two dozen vaccinated condors into the wild in California and Arizona by the end of the year. The government is awaiting additional results before deciding whether free-flying condors should be captured and inoculated. Officials already vaccinate condors in captivity and in the wild for West Nile virus. Dr. Carlos Sanchez, the Oregon Zoo's director of animal health, said wildlife officials faced questions about undertaking the bird flu vaccine study. \"Human intervention, veterinary intervention, is not something we do all the time or take lightly,\" he said. \"It wasn't an easy decision.\" The shots initially were tested on black vultures to make sure they could be safely injected into condors in managed care beginning in July. The post-inoculation monitoring and testing lasted 42 days and officials said no adverse reactions occurred. Dr. Dominique Keller, the LA Zoo chief veterinarian, said participating in the historic trial was one of her career's highlights. She hopes the condor study will lead to bird flu vaccines for other endangered species. \"It was just so incredible to be the first one to hold the vaccine in my hand and actually give it to the first bird,\" she said. The trial's second test group includes 10 condors vaccinated with one dose of a single milliliter (0.03 fluid ounces). Results from those birds will determine whether condors in the wild will get the shot. \"We want to look at the data more holistically before we kind of jump ahead to what's next,\" Blackford said. The condor is intrinsically tied to several Native American tribes in the West and is considered by tribal members to be equal or even superior to humans. The condor disappeared from the Yurok Tribe's ancestral lands in Northern California in the late 1800s but returned in 2021 after major conservation efforts from a team led by Tiana Williams-Claussen, the tribe's wildlife department director. Watching the avian flu wipe out 21 birds in Arizona just a few years later was \"deeply impactful\" to members of the tribe, Williams-Claussen said. The study and vaccine could prevent a repeat of the devastation. \"We're all kind of waiting with bated breath to see what the final results are going to be,\" she said.

{"id": "347", "title": "How the current bird flu strain evolved to be so deadly", "date": "2023-10-18", "fulltext": "Genetic changes to avian influenza viruses have led to spread among many wild species, creating an uncontrollable global outbreak. Researchers studying the evolution of the bird flu virus over the past 18 years have shown how the strain currently circulating worldwide, an extremely deadly form of the H5N1 subtype, has become increasingly infectious to wild birds. The strain emerged in Europe in 2020, and has spread to an unprecedented number of countries. The study, published in Nature on 18 October1, looked at changes to the virus' genome over time and used data on reported outbreaks to track how it spread. Why is bird flu so bad right now? In 2020, the rate of spread among wild birds was three times faster than that in farmed poultry, because of mutations that allowed the virus to adapt to diverse species. 'What was once very clearly a poultry pathogen has now become an animal-health issue much more broadly,' says Andy Ramey, a wildlife geneticist at the US Geological Survey Alaska Science Center in Anchorage. 'That has implications for wildlife and domestic poultry as well as us humans that rely upon these resources.' Persistent outbreaks H5N1, classified as a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus because of its high death toll in poultry, was first detected in birds in China in 1996. Outbreaks are usually seasonal, synchronizing with bird migration in Northern Hemisphere autumn. But since November 2021, they have become persistent. In 2022, the virus killed millions of birds across five continents and seeded outbreaks among farmed mink and various marine mammals. To study changes in the virus' behaviour, the authors examined data reported to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and the World Organisation for Animal Health between 2005 and 2022, and analysed more than 10,000 viral genomes. Their work reveals that in mid-2020, a new H5N1 strain evolved from an earlier variety, called H5N8, which first emerged in poultry in Egypt between 2016 and 2017 and caused global flare-ups throughout 2020 and 2021 (see 'Bird flu outbreaks'). The new H5N1 virus mutated through interactions with non-deadly varieties of bird flu, called low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, that had been circulating among wild birds in Europe since 2019. It developed two subtypes in 2021 and 2022. One spread across the northern coastal regions of central Europe and was eventually carried to North America by birds migrating across the Atlantic Ocean. The other was carried around the Mediterranean Sea and into Africa. Many bird flu outbreaks begin in poultry, but spillover into wild birds has spread the disease into larger areas, creating a global challenge that is difficult to manage, the study found. 'Once it's adapted to wild birds, we have no mechanism to control the virus. And I think that's the biggest impact that has changed now,' says co-author Vijaykrishna Dhanasekaran, an evolutionary biologist and virologist at the University of Hong Kong. Louise Moncla, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, agrees. 'Regardless of how much outbreak response you do in poultry, if it's coming in from wild birds repeatedly, this is going to be really hard to manage.' 'This is really something that most of the world at this point has skin in the game,' adds Ramey. Mixing viruses LPAI viruses often circulate freely in poultry and wild birds. Previous infection with these non-deadly strains is thought to encourage population immunity in wild birds. 'You can think of it as an imperfect vaccine, that doesn't stop infection, but it helps mitigate the effects of disease,' says Ramey. But 'there's probably two sides of the coin here' he adds. HPAI viruses can mutate through interactions with LPAI ones. In both, the genome is split into eight segments that can be mixed and matched. 'When two viruses co-infect the same cell, they could swap their genes when the virus is getting packaged,' says Dhanasekaran. Because of this, LPAI viruses 'especially a strain called H9N2' play a major part in the evolution of H5N1, he adds. But they are not well monitored. 'Eradication or elimination strategies that target these low pathogenic viruses would be a huge step forward in terms of controlling avian influenza itself,' says Dhanasekaran. References 1.

{"id": "348", "title": "Centre of deadly bird flu outbreaks shifts from Asia to Europe and Africa", "date": "2023-10-19", "fulltext": "Increase of virus in wild birds is driving evolution and spread of new strains, researchers found The epicentre of deadly bird flu outbreaks has shifted from Asia to Europe and Africa, a new study has found. For 25 years, bird flu viruses typically emerged from Asia, but major changes in the virus and its spread among wild birds mean the outbreaks are shifting. Research shows that while outbreaks in 2016 and 2017 started in China, two new H5 viruses emerged in 2020 in African poultry and in 2022 in European wild birds. These results highlight a shift in the HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5 epicentre beyond Asia, researchers write in the paper published in Nature. The latest outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1 caused Europe's worst bird flu outbreak, before spreading globally. It has now reached every continent except Oceania and Antarctica, killing record numbers of domestic and wild birds, and even jumping into mammals. It can also jump to humans: since 2003, H5N1 was found in 873 humans, resulting in 458 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Most cases were linked to the handling of infected poultry, and it is not known to be able to transmit from human to human. An international team of scientists led by the University of Hong Kong analysed outbreaks between 2005 and 2022, collecting data on confirmed cases from the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health. They also studied 10,000 sets of viral DNA. Despite the number of outbreaks, only 0.2% of cases were sequenced, researchers said, and urged countries to increase surveillance to understand how the virus is changing. Monitoring infrastructure is particularly weak in Africa, they said. The authors suggest the increasing persistence of avian flu in wild birds is driving the evolution and spread of new strains. Bird flu is highly infectious, with scientists saying one bird can infect as many as 100, with the virus present in faeces, mucus, blood and saliva. UK government authorities say more than 99% of cases in poultry in the UK have come from wild birds. Mass culling used to be an effective policy to control the disease's spread in poultry, but because avian flu is now so widespread in wild bird populations, this is proving less effective. The spread of bird flu within the poultry industry is determined by human activity and how birds are traded. In wild birds, migratory flyways are key indicators of where the disease will spread, with key migration routes along the east Atlantic and Pacific flyways, meaning it has been able to spread to new areas that have never been exposed to it before. Working out how many wild birds have died is difficult because so many carcasses are never found or counted, but researchers say it will be in the millions.

{"id": "349", "title": "Wild birds gain immunity to avian flu in �ncouraging sign�mid deadly outbreak", "date": "2023-10-20", "fulltext": "Scientists find antibodies in Scottish populations of northern gannets and shags as poultry infections in Britain fall dramatically Some birds have developed immunity to avian flu, according to scientists who say there are 'encouraging signs' that the deadly virus could kill fewer birds this winter. The current H5N1 bird flu outbreak, which started in 2021, has been the worst recorded, and is thought to have killed millions of wild birds. Mortality rates appeared to be very high among wild birds, but it was not known how many survived and gained immunity. Preliminary research by a consortium of scientists has confirmed that two populations of seabirds now have immunity. They took blood samples of northern gannets on Scotland's Bass Rock, which were hit hard by avian flu in 2022, and found that 30% of them had antibodies. Britain is home to two-thirds of the world's northern gannets, and ornithologists are particularly concerned about the species. Bass Rock is the world's largest colony. The researchers also tested shags, and found that about half had immunity. 'This is the first evidence [of immunity] in seabirds,' said Prof Ian Brown, head of virology at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). 'It is giving us insights into populations that we have never seen exposed to this virus before.' The research was done by the FluMap consortium, which is led by the APHA, and their key findings have been published in Ibis, the International Journal of Avian Science. The sample size was small: about 30 birds for each population. Brown said it was extremely challenging catching wild birds and taking blood samples (which is partly why it has not been done before). But the findings support observations from conservationists that some birds appear to have acquired immunity, notably gannets, whose typically blue irises turned black after surviving infection. It is not known how long immunity will last, as avian flu changes quickly, or what percentage of birds survived getting the disease initially. Seabird populations are slow to recover because they typically only have one or two offspring a year, so there are still concerns about long-term impacts. Researchers now want to test other wild birds, especially those living on farms, to find out more about how the virus is getting into poultry sheds. The virus can travel only short distances, less than 10 metres, researchers say, so is unlikely to be spread through airborne transmission between farms. This suggests transmission is mostly via wild birds. Researchers are now watching anxiously to see what happens this winter. October is a month of uncertainty due to the influx of migratory birds and the possible new variants they might bring with them. Between 1 October and 28 October 2022, there were 58 confirmed cases in poultry in Britain. This year, there have so far been none in October. Globally, there are very few poultry cases in northern Europe, and a handful in wild birds. 'If you compare that to the same period last year, it is quite different,' said Brown. He added: 'We're in a very uncertain window at the moment, and we won't be advocating any dropping of biosecurity standards. Far from it, because this is a very unpredictable virus and an unpredictable disease. But at the moment, they're encouraging signs.' The H5N1 virus has multiple genes that can switch and evolve together to spread the virus quickly into a wide range of species. When the latest outbreak started, it was because changes to the virus made it much deadlier and more transmissible. Recent changes in the dominant strain of H5N1 in the UK suggest it could now be changing to become less virulent.

{"id": "350", "title": "New deadly bird flu cases reported in Iowa, joining 3 other states as disease resurfaces", "date": "2023-10-23", "fulltext": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Two commercial turkey farms in Iowa have been hit by the reemerging highly pathogenic bird flu, causing about 100,000 birds to be killed to prevent the disease from spreading. The Iowa Department of Agriculture reported the infected commercial poultry flocks within weeks of a turkey farm in South Dakota and one in Utah reporting the first outbreaks in the U.S. since April, raising concerns that more would follow. The U.S. Department of Agriculture shows 12 commercial flocks in South Dakota, Utah and Minnesota have been affected in October, totaling more than 500,000 birds. Bird flu last year cost U.S. poultry producers nearly 59 million birds across 47 states, including egg-laying chickens and turkeys and chickens raised for meat, making it the country's deadliest outbreak ever, according to USDA figures. The outbreak caused spikes in egg and turkey prices for consumers and cost the government over $660 million. Iowa was the hardest-hit state last year, with nearly 16 million birds lost, but there hadn't been a case reported in the state since March. Iowa's department reported Friday that one commercial turkey facility of about 50,000 birds in Buena Vista County was affected. Another facility of about 47,500 turkeys in neighboring Pocahontas County was confirmed Monday. In Guthrie County, about 50 backyard birds were also infected, the department said. Before last week, the only reports of bird flu in recent months in the U.S. in recent months were sporadic appearances in backyard flocks or among wild birds such as ducks, geese and eagles. While wild birds often show no symptoms of avian influenza, infections in them are a concern to the poultry industry as migration season gets underway. Migrating birds can spread the disease to vulnerable commercial flocks. Bird flu infections are relatively rare in humans and aren't considered a food safety risk.

{"id": "351", "title": "�atastrophic� bird flu reaches Antarctic for the first time", "date": "2023-10-24", "fulltext": "As the first known cases of H5N1 are detected in the region, scientists fear for the isolated penguin and seal populations that have never been exposed. Avian flu has reached the Antarctic, raising concerns for isolated populations of penguins and seals that have never been exposed to the deadly H5N1 virus before. The full impact of the virus' arrival is not yet known, but scientists are raising concerns about possible 'catastrophic breeding failure' of the region's fragile wildlife populations. The virus was found in populations of a scavenging bird called brown skua on Bird Island, which is part of the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. These migratory birds probably brought it with them from South America where bird flu is widespread and has already killed an estimated 500,000 seabirds and 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru alone. The current outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1, which started in 2021, is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds. Researchers have long been concerned about its potential impact on Antarctic wildlife, because many species are found nowhere else in the world, and are not known to have been exposed to bird flu viruses before. Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) took swabs of the birds when they found unexplained mortality and sent them for testing in the UK. Ashley Bennison, the BAS science manager for Bird Island, said: 'This is a particularly sad event to confirm. We will continue to monitor the species on the island as best as we can and keep the science going, but we are unsure of the full impact at the moment.' Bird Island is considered one of the planet's richest wildlife sites, home to many endangered bird species as well as 50,000 pairs of breeding penguins and 65,000 pairs of fur seals. The island lies just off the north-west tip of South Georgia, about 600 miles south-east of the Falkland Islands. A risk assessment on the impacts of bird flu reaching the continent, published by Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, said fur seals, sea lions, skuas and gulls were the most at risk, followed by penguins, birds of prey, sheathbills and giant petrels. Dr Meagan Dewar, the chair of the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network, who was the lead author of the report, said that the disease could result in 'catastrophic breeding failure' in the region, with a 'devastating impact on many wildlife species.' The report states that 'ongoing disease surveillance programmes should be established to identify new and emerging pathogens.' H5N1 spread almost 4,000 miles down South America in the space of three months, facilitated by migration routes of wild birds. The fact it had already spread down South America made it likely it would arrive in South Georgia at some point, researchers say. As a result of the positive tests on Bird Island, most field work that involves animal handling has been suspended.

South Georgia is part of the British overseas territory east of South America's tip and just above Antarctica's main landmass. The British Antarctic Survey believes the birds carried the disease on their return from migration to South America. In August this year, OFFLU - an open network of global avian influenza experts - warned of a \"substantial risk\" of a southward spread of the HPAI H5 virus from South America, where it was first detected in October 2022. In a report published August 23, OFFLU warned that the disease could reach Antarctica and its offshore islands \"due to the spring migration of wild birds from South America to breeding sites in the Antarctic.\" It pointed to \"immense\" negative impact on the Antarctic wild birds and mammal population due to \"their likely susceptibility to mortality from this virus, and their occurrence in dense colonies of up to thousands of pinnipeds and hundreds of thousands of birds, allowing efficient virus transmission.\" Bird flu is caused by infections that occur naturally among wild aquatic birds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infected birds can transmit the virus to other animals through their saliva and other bodily discharges. Antarctica and its offshore islands are home to \"more than 100 million breeding birds, six species of pinnipeds and 17 species of cetaceans,\" according to OFFLU, which warns of the possibility of \"efficient virus transmission\" in the region. One of the key objectives of OFFLU, which was founded jointly in 2005 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Organisation for Animal Health, is to gather data on the viruses and analyze disease patterns. The British Antarctic Survey, which is responsible for the UK's national scientific activities in Antarctica, operates two research stations on South Georgia, including one at Bird Island where the confirmed cases were identified.

Staff from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) swabbed populations of brown skua birds after reports of 'several potentially symptomatic birds' and unexplained deaths on Bird Island, South Georgia, a remote island more than 1,000 miles east of the southern tip of Argentina, the institute wrote on its website. Norman Ratcliffe, a seabird ecologist with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) said the agency found a giant petrel bird that was showing signs of bird flu on Sept. 17. 'It was lethargic, showing uncoordinated behavior, twitching of the head,' Ratcliffe said to USA TODAY on Monday. 'The next day it had died and was being savaged by skuas.' By Oct. 7, the organization found another dead skua, and since then the number of skua deaths has increased quite a bit, he said. Swab samples were returned to the United Kingdom so the Animal and Plant Health Agency laboratories in Weybridge could test them. The samples came back positive for the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza or HPAI. New study: Can alligators help control Florida's python population? Research provides clues Researchers think birds contracted the virus in South America The British Antarctic Survey believes the virus is spreading through natural pathways. BAS figured brown skuas and giant petrels would bring the disease to Bird Island because they are scavengers, increasing their chances of eating infected flesh, Ratcliffe said. While the source of the disease on Bird Island is not certain, it is likely that it was introduced via skuas returning from their migration in Argentina, where there are known to be a high number of cases, researchers said. 'If the birds are sneezing and coughing, it transmits that way, but particularly through feces,' Ratcliffe said. 'These scavengers will be going around all the different seal and bird colonies we expect to start to see it infect other species at some point in the near future.' Discovery sheds light on when birds show symptoms The main takeaway from the positive tests is that the birds who contract the virus are able to travel far distances before showing signs of it. Researchers thought the birds would get sick on their way back to the island and wouldn't make it such a long distance but they did, he said. 'It's a matter of days between the bird catching it and it starting to get symptoms,' he said. 'This appearance on South Georgia doesn't mean it's on the way to Antarctica but it does show that those sorts of journeys are possible. It's kind of likely that we will start to see cases in an in the peninsula region before too long.' Containing the outbreak BAS said it's working with the Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands and following its response plan to monitor and manage the outbreak. The British Antarctic Survey has two research stations in South Georgia, including the one at Bird Island, where the bird flu cases were confirmed. Most field work involving animal handling has been suspended due to the recent positive tests. According to the agency, biosecurity measures such as enhanced cleaning of clothing and field equipment are still in place. Forget winter solstice.

More on the viral disease that has swept through populations across the world Avian influenza is a viral disease that mainly impacts birds. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses are common in wild birds and often cause no signs of disease, the British Antarctic Survey said. However, some strains of the virus are highly pathogenic in domestic poultry and can cause high death rates if they escape into wild bird populations. These strains are known as highly pathogenic avian influenza. The current outbreak of the H5N1 virus started in 2022 and has killed many seabirds in the Northern Hemisphere, the south of Africa, around the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and throughout South America. The virus mainly impacts birds, but some mammals have been infected, likely due to them eating infected birds or carcasses. Cases have also been found in some marine mammals where consuming infected birds doesn't apply.

(AP) After confirming the presence of highly pathogenic avian flu in a flock of chickens, nearly 48,000 birds were killed at a north Alabama farm, state agriculture officials said. A Marshall County commercial pullet farm—one that raises chicks from hatching until they are ready to produce eggs when they are moved to a laying barn—was placed under quarantine after samples were confirmed positive for HPAI, the Alabama Department of Agriculture & Industries announced Friday. HPAI is highly contagious to birds but considered low risk to humans and the virus is not considered a threat to food safety, the department said. It is critical for commercial and backyard poultry operations to remain alert and closely monitor the health of their poultry, Alabama Agriculture Commissioner Rick Pate and State Veterinarian Tony Frazier said in a joint statement. The HPAI infected flock in Marshall County reinforces the need to continue following strict biosecurity measures, including keeping birds enclosed without access to wild birds or other domestic flocks. All poultry within a 6.2-mile (10-kilometer) radius of the farm are being tested and monitored, al.com reported. However, no other flocks have experienced an uptick in deaths, the news site reports. HPAI symptoms in birds include a sudden increase in bird deaths in the flock; watery and green diarrhea; lack of energy and poor appetite and a drop in egg production or soft or thin-shelled, misshaped eggs. The detection of the virus in Marshall County comes a week after HPAI was confirmed in an upland gamebird farm in Chilton County. All poultry there—nearly 296,500 birds—were affected and all will be killed, the department said. It was not immediately clear if the cases at both farms were connected. The department urged the commercial poultry industry and backyard flock owners to increase biosecurity measures to protect their operations from HPAI by, among other things, cleaning vehicles and equipment; changing clothes upon contact with birds and limiting unnecessary visitors.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that the virus was found at a farm in Wright County, Minnesota, as well as in three smaller flocks in South Dakota and Iowa. Whenever the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is detected on a farm, the entire flock is killed as to keep it from spreading to other farms. In addition to the Minnesota case, the USDA said some 26,800 turkeys will be killed on a farm in McPherson County in South Dakota and nearly 17,000 birds will be slaughtered on two farms in Iowa's Clay County. The egg and poultry industry has been dealing with a bird flu outbreak since last year. In 2022, nearly 58 million birds—mostly chicken and turkeys—were slaughtered to deal with the virus, contributing significantly higher egg and turkey prices. The Minnesota farm is the first egg-laying operation where bird flu has been found this year. The toll overall has been much lower in 2023 than in 2022 as the number of cases found in wild birds plummeted and farmers redoubled their efforts to prevent any contact between their birds and the ducks and geese migrating past their farms. Even after 940,000 chickens on the Minnesota farm are slaughtered, there will only have been about 3.4 million birds killed this year. Minnesota has now lost a total of more than 5.5 million birds since the outbreak began. Iowa, which is home to many massive egg farms, has been the hardest hit with more than 16 million birds slaughtered, including one case where 5 million egg-laying chickens had to be killed. Egg farms like the one in Minnesota tend to have the most birds on any one farm. Turkey and chicken operations usually involve fewer birds. There have been a number of cases reported over the past month, mostly at turkey farms in Minnesota, South Dakota and Iowa, as wild birds began to migrate south for the winter. But the virus can be found on any farm because it is spread easily, primarily through the droppings of wild birds or direct contact with them. Egg and poultry farmers take steps like requiring their workers to change clothes and sanitize their boots before stepping inside their barns, limiting the sharing of tools between barns, and sealing up their facilities to prevent wildlife from getting inside. Officials stress that bird flu isn't a threat to food safety because all the birds on a farm where the disease is found are slaughtered before they reach the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.89 degrees Celsius) will kill any viruses.

The highly-contagious avian influenza virus was mainly found at a farm in Wright County, located in the east central part of the state, just northwest of Minneapolis, according to statistics posted on the USDA website and a report from the Associated Press. Whenever the bird flu is detected in a flock, it must be destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading, according to USDA fact sheet. As of Tuesday, 1,302,450 birds in the state were infected with the virus that has killed hundreds of thousands of domestic and wild birds across the world, according to information from the USDA and the state's Department of Natural Resources. The virus can cause mild to severe illness in people. According to the USDA, the virus was also found in flocks in two of Minnesota's four neighboring states of Iowa (162,550 birds) and South Dakota (300,800 birds). The federal agency also said 26,800 turkeys are slated to be slaughtered at a McPherson County farm in South Dakota, the AP reported, and just under 17,000 birds are set to be killed on two farms in Iowa's Clay County. A USDA spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday. What is the bird flu? The bird flu, is disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted between birds. Avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and USDA, are classified into two groups: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) (often seen in wild birds) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) (found mostly in domestic poultry). According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease and HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds. The bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds have been slaughtered this year to limit the spread of the virus. Bird flu confirmed in Antarctic region: First cases of bird flu confirmed more than 1,000 miles from South America What are signs of bird flu? Indications a bird may be infected with avian influenza include: * Loss of appetite, lethargy * Sudden death without prior symptoms * Eyelid swelling * Twisting of the head and neck * Purple discoloration to body parts including waddle and legs * Stumbling and falling * Diarrhea * Difficulty breathing * Nasal discharge Bird flu symptoms in humans Bird flu infections in humans are rare according to the CDC. The first case of avian influenza in a person in the United States was reported in Colorado in April 2022. As of Wednesday, according to CDC stats, only four human infections with LPAI viruses had been identified in the United States - and all four people suffered mild-to-moderate illness. Human infection with the bird flu can happen during close contact with infected birds or when people touch sick birds or their saliva, mucus and feces, the CDC said. People contract the virus when it gets into a their eyes, nose or mouth, or when it is inhaled. Those who contract the virus often experience mild illnesses including an eye infection and upper respiratory symptoms or no symptoms at all, while others can develop a severe sometimes fatal disease like pneumonia.

{"id": "357", "title": "1.2 million chickens will be slaughtered at an Iowa farm where bird flu was found", "date": "2023-11-10", "fulltext": "An additional 1.2 million chickens will be slaughtered to prevent the spread of the bird flu after the virus was confirmed on an Iowa egg farm in the second massive case this week. The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced the latest bird flu infection at a farm in Taylor County Friday, and Iowa's governor immediately declared a disaster there to make sure the state has the resources to respond quickly. The Iowa case is just the latest one in the outbreak that began early last year and has prompted officials to kill a total of nearly 63 million birds. Earlier this week, 1 million chickens were killed on a Minnesota egg farm. But the vast majority of the cases, or nearly 58 million birds, occurred last year. Anytime a case of bird flu is found the entire flock is killed to help keep the highly contagious virus from spreading to another farm. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has been finding fewer wild birds carrying the virus this year, which suggests that some ducks and geese may be developing immunity. Farmers also have been working hard to keep the virus off their farms, and the government has been trying to respond quickly anytime bird flu is found. Iowa remains the hardest hit state in the nation, with more than 17 million birds killed there since the outbreak began. The state is the nation's leading egg producer and egg farms tend to have the most birds. In one case last year, 5 million chickens were slaughtered on a single Iowa egg farm. Nebraska comes next with more than 6.7 million birds killed, followed by Colorado's 6.26 million and Minnesota's 5.6 million. Most of the recent cases this fall have been found in Minnesota, South Dakota and Iowa along one of the major migratory paths ducks and geese follow as they fly south for winter. The virus is spread easily by the droppings of those wild birds that can be tracked onto farms, and there has been an expected uptick in cases since the fall migration began. Poultry and egg farmers try to keep the virus from reaching their farms by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before they enter barns. Trucks are also sanitized before they enter the farm, and separate sets of tools are kept for each barn. The losses last year contributed to higher egg and poultry prices, but those prices have dropped significantly this year. Bird flu isn't believed to be a threat to food safety because officials slaughter all the birds on farms where the disease is found before they can enter the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.89 degrees Celsius) will kill any viruses. Infections in humans are rare and usually come only in people with prolonged exposure to sick birds.

{"id": "358", "title": "The Bird flu outbreak isn't over, but it's less severe, helping egg and poultry prices recover", "date": "2023-11-14", "fulltext": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Nearly 5 million chickens, turkeys and other birds have been slaughtered this year because of a persistent bird flu outbreak that began in 2022, but as big as that number may sound, it's far less than the number of birds killed last year which means consumers aren't seeing as much impact on poultry and egg prices. The 4.6 million birds killed this year compares to the nearly 58 million birds the U.S. Department of Agriculture said were slaughtered last year in the first year of the outbreak. While that decline is welcome news, the fact that infections continue is a worrisome indication that unlike earlier outbreaks, the current virus has found a way to survive through the summers, and poultry will likely always be at risk of the disease. The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through droppings and nasal discharges, and it mutates over time. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out. “The industry is definitely on really high alert,” said veterinarian Denise Heard with the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association trade group. As geese and ducks have started to head south for the winter, cases of bird flu have predictably begun popping up primarily at farms in Minnesota, Iowa and South Dakota along one of the major flyways for migrating birds. Most of those cases involve only tens of thousands of birds, but 1.2 million birds at one Iowa egg farm and another 940,000 chickens at one Minnesota egg farm had to be slaughtered last week after the disease was found. Still, only a small portion of the total flock nationwide has been affected this year, allowing prices to fall closer to where they were before the outbreak began. Egg prices peaked at a nationwide average of $4.82 per dozen in January — more than double the $1.93 per dozen charged a year earlier before the first bird flu case was confirmed in Indiana in February of 2022. They remained at $2.07 per dozen last month, according to new numbers released Tuesday. Turkey and chicken prices also spiked over the past two years, but bird flu wasn't the only factor as feed, fuel and labor costs also soared as part of the widespread inflation that weighed on the entire economy. The average price per pound of a whole chicken has climbed pretty steadily since it was at $1.62 in January 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics latest consumer price data. But it was only at $1.93 per pound in October, up from $1.86 a year ago. Chickens raised for meat haven't been hit as hard by bird flu because that industry is focused in the southeast where there haven't been as many cases, and because those chickens don't live as long before they're killed for meat so there's less chance of infection. Retail turkey prices aren't tracked the same way, but USDA reports show that wholesale frozen turkey prices averaged $1.15 per pound in October, down from last year's $1.79 per pound and the previous year's $1.35 per pound. And many of this year's turkeys are already in cold storage, so even if more turkey farms get hit by the virus the current holiday supply won't be affected. Plus, as the National Turkey Federation trade group points out, many retailers like to discount turkey prices heavily in the hopes that consumers will buy the rest of their Thanksgiving fixings at their stores, so consumers might find even lower prices. “We're in a really good spot for Thanksgiving turkeys,” said Jada Thompson, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. “I think there should be a lot of relief coming in the holiday season.” A combination of factors contributed to the sharp drop in bird flu cases this year. Perhaps the most important is that the number of virus cases the USDA has been finding among wild birds has dropped precipitously, suggesting that some ducks and geese may be developing immunity. But farmers also redoubled efforts to keep the virus from infecting their flocks by tightening up biosecurity practices. Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating. “The biggest thing, of course, that we would stress from here is biosecurity, biosecurity, biosecurity,” Heard said. The USDA says the response to the outbreak has cost the government $757 million so far with most of that going to compensate farmers who have to destroy their flocks. Agriculture economists estimate that the industry has also suffered at least another $1 billion in damages from lost sales and other costs though the total cost to the industry hasn't been tallied up. This outbreak is more widespread than the last big one in 2015 that killed about 50 million chickens and turkeys in 15 states, but it remains less costly as the industry and government apply the lessons learned from that experience. Officials say bird flu doesn't represent a significant health threat. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation's food supply. Properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.89 degrees Celsius) will also kill any viruses. Bird flu vaccines are being developed and might help in the future, but at this point they remain impractical. Export markets might not accept vaccinated birds, every bird would have to get shots individually and costly testing would be needed. “It's not economically feasible right now. And not just from the trade aspects, but just for the whole administration of it to the surveillance of it and the cost of all of that,” said John Clifford, who advises the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council on trade issues as the former chief veterinary officer for the United States.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said all 1.35 million chickens on the farm in Ohio's Union County will be slaughtered to help limit the spread of the highly contagious virus after a case was confirmed in the flock this week. The outbreak that began in early 2022 has been much less severe this year as fewer cases of the virus are being found among the wild birds that spread it. But there have still been 8.1 million birds killed this year to help control the spread of the disease and 5.8 million of those have come just this month as several large egg farms have been struck. That includes 1.2 million birds at one Iowa egg farm and another 940,000 chickens at one Minnesota egg farm that had to be killed. Egg farms tend to be much larger than turkey or chicken farms, sometimes with millions of birds. That's a big part of why Iowa—the nation's largest egg producing state—has been hit the hardest in this outbreak with nearly 17.3 million birds killed. Ohio is also one of the top egg producing states but it has seen only 5.1 million birds killed because of bird flu. This week, there have also been sizeable bird flu cases confirmed on farms in Minnesota, Maryland, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Georgia and California. But the biggest one of those cases was the Maryland chicken farm where 198,200 birds were killed. In 2022, nearly 58 million birds were slaughtered as part of the outbreak.

Super-chickens to the rescue: Scientists show how CRISPR gene editing can combat bird flu What is the bird flu? The bird flu, is disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted between birds. Avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and USDA, are classified into two groups: * Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) (often seen in wild birds) * Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) (found mostly in domestic poultry). According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease and HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds. The bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 65 million birds have been slaughtered since 2022 to limit the spread of the virus. Click to view image. What are signs of bird flu? Indications a bird may be infected with avian influenza include: * Loss of appetite, lethargy * Sudden death without prior symptoms * Eyelid swelling * Twisting of the head and neck * Purple discoloration to body parts including waddle and legs * Stumbling and falling * Diarrhea * Difficulty breathing * Nasal discharge Some symptoms of Avian Influenza (the bird flu). More than 1 million chickens are slated to be slaughtered at a Minnesota farm after the United States Department of Agriculture announced in early November the bird flu virus was found there. (USDA) Chickens in cages at a farm near Stuart on the Guthrie/Adair county line. Nearly 5 million chicken, turkeys and ducks have been slaughtered this year because of a persistent bird flu outbreak that began in 2022, but it's far less than the number killed last year.

{"id": "361", "title": "220 flamingos have been found dead in Argentina from bird flu outbreak", "date": "2023-12-01", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Some 220 flamingos have been found dead in the province of Catamarca in northwestern Argentina due to an outbreak of avian influenza, otherwise known as bird flu, an official told local media. Bird flu is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease that naturally spreads through wild aquatic birds, such as ducks, geese and swans, but can also infect other bird species, such as domestic poultry, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has spread in more than 80 countries since 2022, according to the World Health Organization, and experts have concerns amid its ongoing impact across continents. H5N1 is the predominant version causing problems in the Americas and Europe, and there are several subtypes of the virus reported as the disease continuously mutates, according to WHO. Around the globe, there have been reports of bird flu outbreaks flaring in various mammals such as seals and farmed mink, detection of H5N1 viruses in domestic cats and dogs, as well as a few cases reported in humans. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the virus, according to the New York State Wildlife Health Program. Risk of spread through bird migration The infected species — known as James' flamingo (Phoenicoparrus jamesi), or the puna flamingo — is one of three types of flamingos found in northwestern Argentina. The birds pose a risk of spreading the disease to new areas during migration. Originally, the H5N1 strain spread from North America to South America through migratory birds in a span of three months, according to Dr. Johanna Harvey, a postdoctoral researcher of environmental science and technology at the University of Maryland who has studied the strain. It only takes one infected bird to pass on the virus to a whole flock in a matter of days, Harvey said, adding that flamingos are known to be highly gregarious, social animals that live in large flocks. The H5N1 strain poses a low risk to humans — since December 2021, 11 cases of the strain have been reported in humans globally, according to the CDC. But experts are closely monitoring the lethal pathogen's spread to other mammals, such as when more than 50 sea lions were found dead in August in Argentina due to infection of the virus. \"My concerns are that it's in a lot of birds, birds are clearly continuing to move it, and it's not going away — and as these mortalities pile up, the impact on populations, and potentially even (entire) species, is really great,\" Harvey said. \"The true magnitude of loss here, I do not believe is well understood and has not been documented, because it's a really hard thing to do.\" In this latest outbreak, the provincial director of biodiversity for Catamarca, Anabella Ahumada, confirmed the cause of death of hundreds of flamingos to local media, following positive test results for H5N1 in 3 out of 6 samples taken from the dead birds by SENASA, Argentina's National Food Safety and Quality Service. Park rangers detected the high rates of mortality in the birds near the bodies of water Laguna Grande and Laguna Diamante, Ahumada told local media outlet Catamarca 12. The province has been under epidemiological surveillance since the start of November, Catamarca 12 reported. The Argentine government has recommended that people do not come into contact with sick or deceased birds without adequate protection. More on the bird flu Across the United States, zoos have been moving their captive birds indoors as the rate of infection continues to rise. In 2022, the Pittsburgh Zoo, the Denver Zoo, the Maryland Zoo and other facilities moved their bird species indoors away from people and other wildlife. Last month, the Dallas Zoo moved its flamingos indoors, NBC 5 in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area reported. The virus has spread through saliva, mucus and feces from infected birds, according to the CDC. In mammals, some scavenging species have come in contact with the virus by eating infected bird carcasses, Harvey said. \"As far as people interacting with wild birds, there doesn't seem to be a huge risk to them, because the number of human cases have remained low globally, so we're not too worried about that,\" said Dr. Krysten Schuler, an assistant research professor in the department of public and ecosystem health at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York. \"But the mutation potential and the wide distribution of this virus are the major risk factors.\" James' flamingo is listed as \"near threatened\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species, Schuler noted. The main threats to the bird include habitat loss caused by mining, as well as human disturbances due to recreational activities, according to IUCN. When the virus affects birds that are already struggling population-wise, it can have the potential to eliminate species, Schuler said. There is not much that can be done to stop the spread of the virus, but Schuler recommends that people report any unusual animal deaths without an obvious cause to their state wildlife agencies, so they can be notified of what areas the disease is spreading. \"If there is any potential to do something about it, our best option is right at the beginning,\" Schuler said.", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_8": "\"My concerns are that it's in a lot of birds, birds are clearly continuing to move it, and it's not going away — and as these mortalities pile up, the impact on populations, and potentially even (entire) species, is really great,\" Harvey said.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_9": "\"But the mutation potential and the wide distribution of this virus are the major risk factors.\"", "affirm_transmissible_statement_10": "When the virus affects birds that are already struggling population-wise, it can have the potential to eliminate species, Schuler said.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 3, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has spread in more than 80 countries since 2022, according to the World Health Organization, and experts have concerns amid its ongoing impact across continents.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "H5N1 is the predominant version causing problems in the Americas and Europe, and there are several subtypes of the virus reported as the disease continuously mutates, according to WHO.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "Around the globe, there have been reports of bird flu outbreaks flaring in various mammals such as seals and farmed mink, detection of H5N1 viruses in domestic cats and dogs, as well as a few cases reported in humans.", "affirm_why_statement_4": "The birds pose a risk of spreading the disease to new areas during migration.", "affirm_why_statement_5": "Originally, the H5N1 strain spread from North America to South America through migratory birds in a span of three months, according to Dr. Johanna Harvey, a postdoctoral researcher of environmental science and technology at the University of Maryland who has studied the strain.", "affirm_why_statement_6": "It only takes one infected bird to pass on the virus to a whole flock in a matter of days, Harvey said, adding that flamingos are known to be highly gregarious, social animals that live in large flocks.", "affirm_why_statement_7": "But experts are closely monitoring the lethal pathogen's spread to other mammals, such as when more than 50 sea lions were found dead in August in Argentina due to infection of the virus.", "affirm_why_statement_8": "The virus has spread through saliva, mucus and feces from infected birds, according to the CDC.", "affirm_why_statement_9": "In mammals, some scavenging species have come in contact with the virus by eating infected bird carcasses, Harvey said.", "affirm_why_statement_10": "But the mutation potential and the wide distribution of this virus are the major risk factors.", "affirm_why_count": 10, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_statement_1": "The H5N1 strain poses a low risk to humans — since December 2021, 11 cases of the strain have been reported in humans globally, according to the CDC.", "deny_why_statement_2": "\"As far as people interacting with wild birds, there doesn't seem to be a huge risk to them, because the number of human cases have remained low globally, so we're not too worried about that,\" said Dr. Krysten Schuler, an assistant research professor in the department of public and ecosystem health at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York.", "deny_why_count": 2, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "362", "title": "Turkey prices are down. A deadly bird flu could change that", "date": "2023-12-02", "fulltext": "New York (CNN) — Egg and turkey prices are down. But a deadly bird flu is still threatening poultry flocks, turkey in particular. So while breakfast is likely to stay cheap, get ready for more expensive turkey sandwiches. Last year, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) devastated chicken flocks, with egg-laying hens bearing the brunt. The virus was one reason for the massive spike in egg prices. But this year, the virus got off to a slow start, allowing egg supplies to bounce back. The current outbreak of HPAI hit the United States in February 2022, and ripped through poultry farms across the country. By the end of last year, about 60 million birds had been killed because of the virus. Today, the total tally is up to about 68 million, a sign that the disease has slowed, but not disappeared, in 2023. After a mostly virus-free start to the year, cases started ticking up in the fall. In the past month, Iowa farms have killed over 2.8 million birds this season due to the virus. Earlier in November, an Ohio egg farm slaughtered over 1.3 million birds because of the flu. \"Nationally, we are seeing an uptick, again, in some commercial premises across the US,\" Dennis Summers, Ohio's state veterinarian and chief of the state's division of animal health, said in an interview with CNN. In the US, the deadly flu has been spreading as wild birds migrate south this fall. If they land and mingle with backyard flocks, or their droppings are dragged into chicken coops, the virus can be introduced to commercial operations, he explained. When that happens, the entire flock is eradicated to prevent the disease from spreading. The fall migratory season lasts until about the end of the year, said Summers. So what happens in the next month or so will help determine the trajectory of the virus this year, and how many more farms are affected. \"We're just hoping that we can hold on and get through this until [the flu] mutates to a non-pathogenic form,\" Summers said. \"And then we can go from there.\" Egg supplies stay strong Even with millions of chickens culled at egg farms, there are plenty of eggs this year, said Emily Metz, president and CEO of the American Egg Board, a farmer-funded group that is dedicated to increasing US demand for eggs. \"We've seen some small-scale outbreaks so far on a few egg farms,\" she said. \"Supply is strong, there's plenty of eggs.\" According to the USDA, egg production was up 4% in October compared to last year. As egg supplies bounced back, prices have fallen, declining about 22% in the 12 months through October, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So far, many of the egg farms where the virus was detected — and birds culled — have been focused on selling whites and yolks to food makers, rather than to grocery stores as shell eggs, noted Ryan Hojnowski, egg market analyst and reporter for Urner Barry, which publishes market information. With these factors in mind, prices are unlikely to skyrocket again. \"It doesn't seem like there's a catalyst as of right now, this second, that is pointing toward a price action being anything what it was like last year,\" said Hojnowski. Still, he said, it's a \"very fluid situation.\" But when it comes to turkey, price hikes are on the horizon. Turkey takes a hit This year, turkey prices were low ahead of Thanksgiving — partially because turkey farmers expected an outbreak in the spring that didn't really happen, boosting turkey supplies, explained Matt Busardo, poultry market reporter at Urner Barry. But the uptick of bird flu cases has hit turkey farms hard, and threatens to tighten supply in groceries this spring. \"Just since October, there's been two and a half million or so [turkey] losses,\" Busardo noted. Most of those were \"meat birds,\" he said — headed to slaughter to be turned into deli meat, rather than sold as whole birds for roasting. \"When spring rolls around and everyone wants to get their turkey clubs... that's what this impacts the most,\" he said. \"What we're seeing now shows that there's going to be a tighter supply come spring.\" In Minnesota, roughly 1.6 million birds have been killed in the last month, many of them turkeys. The state is especially vulnerable to bird flu because of its geographic properties, noted Ohio's Summers. \"There's tons of lakes and ponds up there,\" he said. \"So those migratory birds will land.\" If migrations slow — as they very well may, thanks to frigid weather — infections could also, lessening the impact on turkey supply and prices. In general this year, \"bird losses — are quite small relative to last year's impact,\" said Christine McCracken, senior animal protein analyst at Rabobank. \"However, timing is everything,\" she said, noting that there could \"be some spot shortages and/or pricing volatility given the potential for regional losses.\" Busardo doesn't expect turkey prices to surge as much as they did with eggs. In part that's because unlike eggs, turkey isn't a kitchen staple — meaning that higher prices could just lead people to skip that turkey sandwich after all.", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "So what happens in the next month or so will help determine the trajectory of the virus this year, and how many more farms are affected.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "\"We're just hoping that we can hold on and get through this until [the flu] mutates to a non-pathogenic form,\" Summers said.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 2, "affirm_why_statement_1": "If they land and mingle with backyard flocks, or their droppings are dragged into chicken coops, the virus can be introduced to commercial operations, he explained.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "\"We're just hoping that we can hold on and get through this until [the flu] mutates to a non-pathogenic form,\" Summers said. \"And then we can go from there.\"", "affirm_why_count": 2, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "We're just hoping that we can hold on and get through this until [the flu] mutates to a non-pathogenic form.", "deny_transmissible_count": 1, "deny_why_statement_1": "\"We're just hoping that we can hold on and get through this until [the flu] mutates to a non-pathogenic form,\" Summers said. \"And then we can go from there.\"", "deny_why_count": 1, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "363", "title": "Mass deaths of elephant seals recorded as bird flu sweeps across the Antarctic", "date": "2023-12-11", "fulltext": "Researchers warn of one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times if the highly contagious disease reaches penguin colonies. Bird flu is spreading in the Antarctic, with hundreds of elephant seals found dead, and fears it could bring one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times if the highly contagious virus reaches the remote penguin populations. The virus was first reported among brown skua on Bird Island, off South Georgia. Since then, researchers and observers have reported mass deaths of elephant seals, as well as increased deaths of fur seals, kelp gulls, and brown skua at several other sites. Cases have been confirmed 900 miles (1,500km) west of South Georgia, among southern fulmar on the Falkland Islands. Dr. Meagan Dewar, chair of the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network, told the Guardian that the situation among southern elephant seals was concerning. \"At some sites we've had mass mortalities, where we are getting into the hundreds,\" she said. \"There is a likely chance it could be avian influenza.\" So far tests have confirmed bird flu deaths at eight sites across the Antarctic, and the disease is suspected with confirmation from tests still pending at 20 further sites where animals have died. Researchers reported that a number of elephant seals had been exhibiting symptoms of avian flu, such as difficulty breathing, coughing, and accumulations of mucus around the nose. Lethargy, spasms, and an inability to fly are symptoms in birds. While a number of seabird cases have been confirmed, many including the elephant seals are still classed as suspected, pending lab results. So far there are no recorded cases on the Antarctic mainland, home to unique ecosystems that are some of the world's most isolated, but the disease is expected to arrive in the coming months as birds move. Dewar said: \"It's devastating to watch that happen and recording all the cases we're getting.\" Penguins are starting to cluster together as the breeding season starts, and this close contact makes them particularly vulnerable. Previous outbreaks in South Africa, Chile, and Argentina show they are susceptible to the disease. \"If the virus does start to cause mass mortality events across penguin colonies, it could signal one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times,\" researchers wrote in a pre-print research paper last month. Many species in the Antarctic are found nowhere else, so the consequences for the region of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) spreading are unknown. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research said recently: \"Given the dense breeding colonies of wildlife in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions, HPAI is expected to have devastating impacts on the wildlife and to lead to catastrophic breeding failure and mortality events in the region.\" The virus has killed an estimated 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru. Dewar said: \"If we start to get outbreaks similar to what we've seen in South America that could have very big impacts. Emperor penguins and chinstrap penguins have been taking significant declines, so if we get large outbreaks in those species, that could cause further pressure on those colonies.\" The current outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1, which started in 2021, is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds. The strain spreading in Antarctica is clade 2.3.4.4b, which has decimated bird populations across the UK, continental Europe, South Africa, and the Americas, with seabird colonies experiencing losses of 50% to 60%. The H5N1 strain has not yet reached Oceania. Dr. Michelle Wille, from the Centre for Pathogen Genomics and the University of Melbourne, who is helping to record deaths, said: \"It's terrible news that it's now in the sub-Antarctic, and we are very worried about viral spread into the Antarctic. In addition to negative effects on animals, the removal of vast numbers of animals from the Antarctic ecosystem may have long-term ecosystem effects.\" Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey and the British government's Animal and Plant Health Agency are identifying possible cases, testing them, and sharing data. It is challenging to record what is happening because of the size of Antarctica and the small number of people monitoring it. A number of reports of mass deaths have come through tour vessels. Many places in South Georgia are now closed to tourists, and even researchers have to go through a number of procedures to get there in a bid to stop the disease spreading, said Dr. Michael Wenger, who trained as a marine biologist and has been working as a guide in Antarctica for 18 years. He added: \"It's already hard to estimate numbers in normal situations, because the area is huge and there are a lot of animals. Now with the areas closed, it's even harder.\" This article was amended on 11 December 2023 because Dr. Michelle Wille is at the University of Melbourne, not Sydney as an earlier version said.", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "The virus was first reported among brown skua on Bird Island, off South Georgia.

{"id": "364", "title": "Bird Flu is Still Causing Havoc. Here�s the Latest.", "date": "2023-12-15", "fulltext": "The virus, which recently reached the Antarctic region for the first time, is surging again in North America. Over the last three years, a highly contagious, often deadly form of bird flu has taken a staggering toll on animals around the globe. The virus, known as H5N1, has infected birds in more than 80 countries. It has infiltrated big commercial poultry farms and tiny backyard henhouses, affecting 72 million farmed birds in the United States alone, according to the Department of Agriculture. It has struck a wide range of wild bird species, killing gulls and terns by the thousand. And it has turned up repeatedly in mammals, including foxes, skunks, bears, cats, sea lions and dolphins. (It has also caused a small number of deaths in people, primarily in those who had close contact with birds. The risk to the general public remains low, experts say.) The virus is not done yet. It is surging again in Europe and North America and causing mass animal mortality events in South America. It also appears to be spreading in the Antarctic region for the first time. 'It continues to be unprecedented,' said Thomas Peacock, a virologist at the Pirbright Institute in England. 'By several measures, we're at the worst it's ever been, particularly in terms of geographical spread, how widespread it is in birds and how many mammals are getting infected.' In Europe, however, where the virus has been circulating the longest, early signs suggest that this winter may not be as bad as the last few, Dr. Peacock said. And there is very preliminary evidence that some wild birds might be developing immunity to the virus. Here's the latest: The virus is expanding into new territory. The current version of the virus has spread around the world with astonishing speed. After emerging in 2020, it quickly began causing outbreaks in Europe, Africa and Asia. In late 2021, it showed up in North America, storming through Canada and the United States. In the fall of 2022, the virus appeared in South America, spreading down to the tip of the continent in mere months. This rapid southward spread prompted concern that the virus would soon reach Antarctica, which provides critical breeding habitat for more than 100 million birds. And in October 2023, the virus was found in the Antarctic region for the first time, detected in brown skuas on Bird Island, South Georgia. Since then, scientists have identified additional confirmed or suspected cases in gulls and petrels as well as in elephant seals and other animals in the region, according to the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network. Although the virus has not yet been reported on the Antarctic mainland, scientists said they were expecting that news to come any day now. 'It probably is already in Antarctica, but it hasn't been picked up,' Dr. Peacock said. Many of the birds and marine mammals in the region are already struggling to survive in the face of climate change and other threats. And because Antarctica has never been hit by a highly pathogenic bird flu virus before, its wild animals could be especially vulnerable to this one, scientists say. Seasonal patterns may be emerging. In the United States, summer provided a respite from what had already become the worst bird flu outbreak in the nation's history. Between May and September, the nation logged just several small outbreaks in poultry, and cases in wild birds tapered off. 'We breathed a sigh of relief for a number of months when things really quieted down,' said Rebecca Poulson, an expert on avian influenza at the University of Georgia. 'But it's back. Or maybe it never left.' Since the beginning of October, the virus has hit more than 1,000 poultry flocks in 47 states; 12 million farmed birds have been affected, according to the U.S.D.A. Europe has documented a similar pattern, with virus detections increasing sharply in late October, according to a recent surveillance report from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Although the virus is still relatively new, these seasonal cycles might be here to stay. 'My gut would say it might be part of the new normal,' Dr. Poulson said. Hot, humid weather is not traditionally conducive to the spread of flu viruses, and many birds are stationary in the summer, spending those months on their breeding grounds. In the fall, many birds begin migrating and avian populations swell with young birds that have little exposure to the flu. All of these factors can fuel autumn surges. (The virus can also flare up in the spring, when birds migrating in the other direction congregate at high densities.) Immunity remains a wild card. Now that the virus has been circulating for several years, critical questions have arisen regarding immunity: Do birds that survive a brush with the virus gain some immunity against it — and could that dampen the ferocity of these outbreaks? There is little data so far, but in one recent study, scientists found potential signs of immunity in northern gannets, a seabird species that suffered heavy losses in H5N1 outbreaks in 2022. 'This is encouraging, particularly for species with threatened populations,' said Diann Prosser, a research wildlife ecologist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Eastern Ecological Science Center. More anecdotally, in Europe, some of the bird species that were hit hard in previous years do not seem to be dying off at the same rate, Dr. Peacock said. Scientists said they expected that birds that survived infection would develop some degree of immunity to the virus. But what that means for the future of the panzootic — the animal version of a pandemic — will depend on a variety of factors that are harder to pin down, such as how robust that immune protection is, how long it lasts and how well it holds up against a virus that has been evolving rapidly. 'I would expect that development of immunity within the wild bird populations would affect the trajectory of the panzootic, while the specific path is hard to predict,' Dr. Prosser said. Outbreaks in mammals are causing concern. Although the virus is a threat primarily to birds, it has been showing up with unusual frequency in mammals, especially in wild scavengers like foxes. Many of these cases have probably been dead-end infections, in which mammals contracted the virus after eating infected birds and then died without passing the virus on. But some larger outbreaks have caused concern. In the fall of 2022, the virus hit a mink farm in Spain, and over the last several months it has been detected in numerous fur farms in Finland, which house mink, foxes and raccoon dogs. In Peru, H5N1 has been linked to mass die-offs of South American sea lions. Viral samples taken from some of these animals have contained mutations that are known to make the virus better adapted to mammals. Although it is not unusual to see those mutations pop up when mammals are infected, these findings, combined with the size and speed of the outbreaks, have been worrisome. 'It looks like there was probably mammal-to-mammal transmission in at least a couple of cases,' Dr. Peacock said. Although human infections remain rare, a version of H5N1 that spreads more easily among mink or sea lions could also spread more easily among humans, potentially setting off another pandemic, scientists worry. Several curious outbreaks in cats have also been reported this year. One, at a cat shelter in South Korea, was linked to contaminated food, which has also been suggested as a potential cause of cat infections in Poland. Although it is not clear whether the virus spread from cat to cat, viral samples did show signs of mammalian adaptation.

Hot, humid weather is not traditionally conducive to the spread of flu viruses, and many birds are stationary in the summer, spending those months on their breeding grounds.

{"id": "365", "title": "Expect egg costs to rise as bird flu rages", "date": "2023-12-19", "fulltext": "The relief from sky-high egg prices may be starting to crack. Cal-Maine Foods, the largest egg producer in the country, reported recently that a Kansas facility had an avian flu outbreak in about 1.6% of the company's total flock, or about 684,000 laying hens. Meanwhile, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows dozens of commercial flocks have been hit hard by the virus in recent months. The latest bird flu outbreak has stirred concerns that egg prices, which had finally started to settle after reaching nearly $5.50 a dozen late last year, may start spiking again. Seemingly every day there is another announced infection site, which not only physically reduces the actual number of egg layers, but also casts a negative psychology over the entire egg market, Kevin Bergquist, Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute sector manager, said in a written statement. The reaction to supply stress is price increase. Is there another avian flu spike? More than 72.5 million birds have been killed in 2022 and 2023 to stem the spread of the virus, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. After a lull in infections, the agency's data shows we're in the midst of a fall spike. The number of birds killed has risen from 1.4 million in October to 8 million in November and more than 4 million in the first few days of December. The virus is expanding at a very similar pace to the previous major outbreak, so it is serious, Bergquist said. He described the current virus mutation as one of the more virulent and contagious, which is not good for the entire poultry industry. The migration of wild birds is likely the cause of the most recent spike. They're often mixing with other birds and allowing for that amplification, ping-ponging of the virus to occur, said University of Minnesota School of Public Health Professor Jeff Bender. Then, (it's) spilling over into those very susceptible birds like our turkeys and chickens. Why are egg prices going back up? Federal data shows egg prices have dipped more than 22% over the past year as egg producers worked on rebuilding their supply. A USDA report released recently quotes combined regional large egg wholesale prices at $2.06 a dozen, close to the three-year average but far below last year's prices. Egg prices already had been expected to rise this winter because of seasonal demand, and the spike in avian flu infections could compound that. Christmas is one of the times where egg consumption goes up for holiday meals, the eggnog and all that kind of stuff, said Yuko Sato, a poultry extension veterinarian and diagnostic pathologist at Iowa State. So naturally, every year, the egg prices go up during Christmastime or holiday season. But it's unlikely we'll see prices spike as high as they did in 2022 because the egg inventory has rebounded, said Dennis Brothers, associate extension professor at Auburn University's agricultural economics and rural sociology department. I don't think we'll see a price spike in the real near future. At least nothing like we saw last year, he said. Prices are going to go up, of course, because of seasonal demand, and this will start restricting inventory some. But we've got a lot of eggs on hand right now. Bergquist also doesn't expect wholesale egg prices to jump to the levels seen in late 2022, but he does expect higher wholesale egg prices in the near term.

{"id": "366", "title": "Cows Have Almost Certainly Infected More Than Two People With Bird Flu", "date": "2024-01-01", "fulltext": "It was bound to happen again. For the second time in two months, the United States has confirmed a case of bird flu in a dairy worker employed by a farm with H5N1-infected cows. 'The only thing I'm surprised about is that it's taken this long to get another confirmed case,' Steve Valeika, a veterinarian and an epidemiologist based in North Carolina, told me. The true case count is almost certainly higher. For weeks, anecdotal reports of sick farmworkers have been trickling in from around the nation, where H5N1 has been detected in dozens of herds in nine states, according to federal counts. Testing among humans and animals remains limited, and buy-in from farms is still spotty. The gap between reality and what the government can measure is hindering the world from realizing the full scope of the outbreak. And it may hamper experts' ability to detect human-to-human spread, should that someday occur. 'I wouldn't be surprised if there have been dozens of cases at this point,' Valeika said. The risk to most of the public is still low, as federal guidelines continue to emphasize. But that assurance feels tenuous when 'the threat to farmworkers remains high,' Jennifer Nuzzo, the director of the pandemic center at the Brown University School of Public Health, told me. Too often, infectious disease most affects a society's most vulnerable people; now the future of this virus depends on America's ability to protect a community whose health and safety are routinely discounted. Like the first case of a dairy worker contracting avian flu, this second one has at least one reassuring element: Exposure in both cases seems to have involved heavy, repeated contact with infected, lactating animals and resulted in a mild illness that involved only eye symptoms. (In another U.S. case, from 2022, in which a man contracted the virus from poultry, fatigue was the only reported symptom.) Cow udders and human eyes both contain receptors for H5N1 that resemble the ones primarily found in birds, and experts suspect that those receptors are an easy entry point for the virus, which still seems to be very much an avian pathogen. To spread in earnest among people, the virus would still probably need to make a few more evolutionary leaps. For most of the public, 'I'm not worried about H5 right now,' Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University, told me. People who work on dairy farms, though, have reason to worry, Lakdawala added. In the so-called parlors where dairy cows are milked, animals are strapped into machines that latch on to their udders, pump until the rate of flow slows, then release, swinging 'off the animal at eye height,' Lakdawala told me, and blasting bystanders with frothy liquid. The machines aren't necessarily sanitized between each animal and what cleaning does occur often involves a high-pressure hose-down that also mists up milk. The entire process involves a lot of direct maneuvering of udders, as workers load machinery onto each cow and prime their initial milk flow manually. If workers aren't directly getting milk on their hands—which will, at some point, touch their face—they're 'constantly being bombarded with aerosols, droplets, and spray,' Lakdawala said. When infected cows are present, that can mean a lot of virus exposure. Lakdawala's lab has been studying how long H5N1 can persist on milky surfaces, and the initial results, not yet published in a scientific journal, suggest that the virus may linger for at least one to three hours on the same sorts of plastic and metal commonly used in milking equipment. That creates a clear conduit for the virus to move among animals, Lakdawala said, and a very easy path for a human to pick it up, too. Improper disposal of milk could also pose some transmission risk, especially milk from infected farm cows, which still have to be milked if they're lactating. (Several farm cats appear to have caught the virus from drinking raw milk.) The USDA recommends heat-treating all milk before it's discarded, but some farms, especially smaller ones, may not have consistent access to the necessary equipment or human power, Lakdawala told me. The CDC has urged farmworkers to don goggles, gloves, high-quality respirators, and other protective equipment in these environments. But those recommendations can't really be enforced, and it's unclear how many farms have been following them, or how many workers on those farms are complying. In the rising spring and summer heat, wearing that gear may get even less palatable, Lakdawala pointed out, especially in the steamy, cramped environments in which the people with the most exposure do the brunt of their work. Goggles and other tight-fitting eye protection, in particular, are tricky: 'They get dirty very quickly,' Lakdawala said. Workers can't see what they're doing through milk-spattered lenses. Enthusiasm for testing cows and people has also been low on farms, as business owners and employees alike weigh the economic and personal risks they face if one of their herd is reported as sick. And although asymptomatic cows are likely responsible for a good degree of spread, the USDA requires testing of only a subset of the cows being moved between states. That basically ensures that 'we won't find a virus before a farmworker is exposed,' Nuzzo told me. Similarly, the CDC maintains that 'testing of asymptomatic persons' for H5N1 'is not routinely recommended,' and close contacts of infected people aren't guaranteed a screen for the virus. Those sorts of delays could allow infections to simmer—potentially past the window in which intervention with treatments such as Tamiflu or forestalling transmission to close contacts is possible. The fact that this second case was caught doesn't mean that testing is anywhere near sufficient: The diagnosis was made for a farmworker in Michigan, which has more aggressively tested its dairy herds, Nuzzo said. Nuzzo and Lakdawala both argue that stockpiled vaccines should be offered en masse to farmworkers while their risk remains so high, but federal officials haven't yet made the injections available. (The USDA and the CDC did not respond to requests for comment.) These shortfalls would be concerning for any population contending with under-the-radar infections. But among farmworkers especially—a group that includes many migrants and uninsured individuals living in rural regions—H5N1 could play on existing health disparities, Anne Sosin, a public-health researcher at Dartmouth, told me. If protecting farmworkers is a priority, Valeika said, 'I think we're kind of failing.' Researchers are also unsure just how much risk infected farmworkers may pose to their close contacts. Other forms of pink eye are pretty transmissible, and someone who has recently rubbed their eye, Lakdawala said, could presumably pass H5N1 by touching someone else's hand, which could then touch their face. Experts also remain worried that an infection in the eye might find a way to travel to other parts of the body, including the respiratory tract, especially if the virus were to pick up the sorts of mutations that could adapt it to the receptors in our lungs. (The Michigan dairy worker's nose swab, thankfully, turned up negative for an H5 virus.) The virus doesn't yet seem poised for such a jump. But these flu infections are still a problem for everyone. 'If we fail to stop it in the highest-risk groups,' Sosin told me, the threat to the rest of the public will only grow. H5N1 may never spread human-to-human.

{"id": "367", "title": "Polar bear dies from bird flu as H5N1 spreads across globe", "date": "2024-01-03", "fulltext": "Current outbreak, which started in 2021, is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds and thousands of mammals globally. A polar bear has been killed by bird flu as the highly contagious H5N1 virus spreads into the most remote parts of the planet. The death was confirmed in December by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. 'This is the first polar bear case reported, for anywhere,' Bob Gerlach, Alaska's state veterinarian, told the Alaska Beacon. It was found near Utqiagvik, one of the northernmost communities in Alaska, two years after this latest strain was detected in North America. Gerlach said it was likely the bear was scavenging on the carcasses of infected birds. Polar bears are listed as 'vulnerable' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of endangered species, mainly due to the loss of sea ice. It is possible that more bears have died unnoticed as they tend to live in remote places with few people, said Gerlach. 'You're really dependent on the public that's out there, or the wildlife biologists that are doing surveillance,' he said. The current outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1, which started in 2021, is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds. Globally, thousands of mammals have also died of the virus, including black bears and brown bears. Bald eagles, foxes, and kittiwakes are among the species to have died of the virus in Alaska in recent months. 'It's been in Antarctica and now it's in the high Arctic in mammals. It's horrifying,' Diana Bell, emeritus professor of conservation biology at the University of East Anglia, told the Guardian. 'And yet I'm not surprised. In the last couple of years, the list of mammals killed has become enormous. It's killed such a wide range of predatory and scavenging mammals now, this isn't just a poultry disease. When it hits a large, charismatic species like a polar bear, people suddenly sit up and listen—or at least I hope they will. We've already got a pandemic in biodiversity and it's called H5N1 because it's killed so many birds and mammals.' The first known cases of H5N1 were detected in the Antarctic region in October among brown skua on Bird Island, off South Georgia. Two months later, hundreds of elephant seals were found dead. There have also been increased deaths of fur seals, kelp gulls, and brown skua at several other sites. Scientists have warned that the highly contagious virus could bring 'one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times' if it reaches the remote penguin populations. The virus is continuing further south in the Antarctic region. A Brown skua is suspected to have died from it in Heroína Island, on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. It is currently awaiting further testing, according to the latest update on the SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) website. 'It doesn't bode well,' said Dr. Meagan Dewar, leader of the SCAR Antarctic Wildlife Health Network. Dewar was one of the authors of a risk assessment which found many Antarctic animals were threatened, including gulls, skuas, fur seals, and sea lions. She said: 'The analysis indicated a heightened risk that HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] would present in Antarctic species in 2023 or 2024 in the Antarctic Peninsula region and that is exactly what we are seeing.'

{"id": "368", "title": "First Case of Lethal Bird Flu in Polar Bears Reported in Alaska", "date": "2024-01-03", "fulltext": "A highly lethal form of bird flu that has been spreading across the world has now been detected in a dead polar bear in Alaska. It is the first known case in the Arctic animals, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Why It Matters: The virus is a new threat for many wild mammals. The infected polar bear provides further evidence of how widespread this virus, a highly pathogenic form of H5N1, has become and how unprecedented its behavior has been. Since the virus emerged in 2020, it has spread to every continent except for Australia. It has also infected an unusually broad array of wild birds and mammals, including foxes, skunks, mountain lions and sea lions. 'The number of mammals reported with infections continues to grow,' Dr. Bob Gerlach, Alaska's state veterinarian, said. In most cases, the virus has not caused mass die-offs in wild mammal populations. (South American sea lions have been one notable exception.) But it does represent a new threat for the already vulnerable polar bear, which is imperiled by climate change and the loss of sea ice. 'The concern is that we don't know the overall extent of what the virus may do in the polar bear species,' Dr. Gerlach said. Background: The bear showed signs of disease. The polar bear was found dead this past fall in far northern Alaska, near Utqiagvik. Swabs collected from the animal initially tested negative for the virus. But when experts conducted a more comprehensive work-up, performing a necropsy and collecting tissue samples from the bear, they found clear signs of inflammation and disease, Dr. Gerlach said. Last month, tissue samples from the bear tested positive for the virus, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. The virus was ultimately identified in multiple organs, Dr. Gerlach said. 'I think it would be a safe thing to say that it died from the virus,' he said. Alaska has previously reported infections in a brown bear and a black bear, as well as in several red foxes. What We Don't Know: Have other polar bears been infected? It is not clear how the polar bear contracted the virus, but sick birds had been reported in the area. The polar bear might have been infected after eating a dead or ailing bird, Dr. Gerlach said. And scientists don't know whether this case is a one-off or whether there are other infected polar bears that have escaped detection. It can be tricky to monitor the virus in wild animal populations, especially those that live in places as remote as northern Alaska. 'How do you know how many are affected?' Dr. Gerlach said. 'We really don't.' Local scientists, officials and other experts will continue to look for signs of the virus in wild animals, including in polar bears that turn up dead or seem sick, Dr. Gerlach said.

{"id": "369", "title": "Bird flu confirmed among mass sub-Antarctic seal deaths as virus continues global spread", "date": "2024-01-11", "fulltext": "Scientists warn further spread could threaten fragile ecosystem, as tests show seals died of H5N1 on South Georgia island. A virology team has confirmed the first bird flu infections in elephant and fur seals in the sub-Antarctic region, as the highly contagious H5N1 virus continues to spread around the world. Researchers previously reported the mass deaths of seals and that a number of elephant seals on South Georgia island, a UK overseas territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean, had been exhibiting symptoms of avian flu. But while seabird cases were confirmed, the seal infections were classed as suspected, pending lab results. The first known cases of H5N1 were detected in the Antarctic region in October among brown skua on Bird Island, off South Georgia. Two months later, hundreds of elephant seals were found dead. There have also been increased deaths of fur seals, kelp gulls, and brown skua at several other sites. Marco Falchieri, a scientist in the UK Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) influenza and avian virology team, which collected the South Georgia samples that tested positive for bird flu, said he saw about 20 dead elephant seals. \"Emotionally it is almost heartbreaking to see so many dead seals.\" Other seals were showing respiratory signs of bird flu, he said, citing \"coughs, sneezing, ocular discharge, nasal discharge, slow head shaking, and tremors.\" Falchieri said the death toll on South Georgia was probably about 100, mainly elephant seals, who appear to be more affected than fur seals. \"My worst fear is an adaptive mutation to mammals, which we are not seeing in these new samples, but we need to keep monitoring,\" he said.

Banyard's team diagnosed the samples brought back from the island in mid-December. Spillovers occurred, Banyard said, \"when too many birds have bird flu [and] mammals come into close contact with sick birds too or when the mammals eat [an] infected bird carcass.\" In December, the death of a polar bear from bird flu in Alaska was confirmed, and an estimated 20,000 sea lions have died from the virus in Chile and Peru. Although the sub-Antarctic seal and bird deaths are a concern, Banyard said it was good news that the virus had not spread to other species. \"Two years ago, we were worried about the penguins being infected and dying from the disease in the region, but that has not happened, so this is almost a positive outcome.\" If bird flu continued to spread throughout the sub-Antarctic region, however, he said it \"could significantly threaten the fragile ecosystem, and potentially put a number of very large populations of seabirds and sea mammals at risk.\" Norman Ratcliffe, a seabird ecologist with the British Antarctic Survey, said about 98% of the global population of fur seals were found in South Georgia, and that the region hosted \"globally important populations of elephant and fur seals [and these] populations are now at risk from large declines.\" Ratcliffe said there was no way to know total seal deaths, either due to deaths at sea or carcasses being scavenged, \"but we know the number of dead is far higher than what we see and the mortality is much higher than normal rates for this time of year.\"", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "If bird flu continued to spread throughout the sub-Antarctic region, however, he said it \"could significantly threaten the fragile ecosystem, and potentially put a number of very large populations of seabirds and sea mammals at risk.\"", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "\"My worst fear is an adaptive mutation to mammals, which we are not seeing in these new samples, but we need to keep monitoring,\" he said.

{"id": "370", "title": "Unprecedented bird flu outbreak spreads to mammals in sub-Antarctic, UK says", "date": "2024-01-11", "fulltext": "(CNN) — An unprecedented and highly contagious bird flu outbreak in the sub-Antarctic has spread to mammals, British officials said Thursday, as experts warned the disease poses a significant threat to the region's fragile ecosystem. It comes after the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in October confirmed the first case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in the Antarctic region in brown skua on Bird Island, South Georgia, a British overseas territory in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. In a news release Thursday, the United Kingdom's Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) said the disease had now been detected in elephant and fur seals on South Georgia, which lies east of South America's tip and just above Antarctica's main landmass. \"The presence of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) has today been confirmed for the first time in mammals in the sub-Antarctic,\" it said. Bird flu is caused by infections that occur naturally among wild aquatic birds, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Infected birds can transmit the virus to other animals through their saliva and other bodily discharges. In its October statement, BAS said its analysis showed the virus had most likely been introduced to South Georgia through migratory bird movement from South America. In December, experts from APHA and BAS spent three weeks collecting samples from dead mammals and birds in the affected islands. These samples from elephant seals, fur seals, brown skuas, kelp gulls and Antarctic terns have tested positive for HPAI H5N1, APHA said. Fragile ecosystem at risk Antarctica and its offshore islands are home to more than 100 million breeding birds, six seal species and 17 species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises, according to global avian influenza experts network OFFLU, which has previously warned of the possibility of \"efficient virus transmission\" in the region. \"Given Antarctica is such a unique and special biodiversity hotspot it is sad and concerning to see the disease spread to mammals in the region,\" said Ian Brown, APHA's director of scientific services. \"If avian influenza continues to spread throughout the sub-Antarctic region this could significantly threaten the fragile ecosystem, and potentially put a number of very large populations of seabirds and sea mammals at risk.\" Samples collected from albatross and giant petrel colonies on Bird Island tested negative, APHA said. \"There have been no reports of above average mortality in any penguin species to date,\" it added. BAS, which operates two research stations on South Georgia, has out of caution suspended \"most fieldwork involving contact with animals,\" it said.

{"id": "371", "title": "Scientists fear potent avian flu could jump to humans", "date": "2024-01-23", "fulltext": "It felt like watching one of those blockbusters about the end of the world. Like witnessing an apocalypse, but in real life. Which, in a way, it was. The beaches of Valdes Peninsula in Argentina, normally so packed with elephant seals that time of year it is impossible to stroll along the shore, were desolate except for hundreds of dark, rotting carcasses - nearly a whole season of seal pups dead, with gulls pecking at the remains. Instead of the usual cacophony of guttural honks that drowns out the waves during breeding season, the eerie silence was broken only by the sound of a few remaining elephant seals shaking their heads, snot running down their protruding, namesake noses. 'You felt like a bomb had exploded,' said Martí Méndez, recalling the scene he witnessed in October during an annual survey of southern elephant seals in that stretch of coastal Patagonia. 'It is catastrophic,' added the marine biologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society, a New York-based nonprofit group. 'This is the largest die-off for the species, period.' Altogether, an estimated 17,000 elephant seal pups seals died there last year from avian influenza, victims of an unprecedented panzootic - a pandemic among animals - that has struck around 320 types of birds and mammals. Over the past few years, a potent strain of H5N1 avian influenza has jumped between species and raged through domestic and wild animal populations on every continent except Australia and Antarctica, crisscrossing the world along birds' migratory routes. So far, cases of humans getting seriously sick from this strain of flu are rare. But the possibility of the quickly evolving influenza virus gaining the ability to be transmitted between from one mammal to another - and eventually, to humans - has scientists concerned about the pathogen turning into another pandemic. 'Every year that this doesn't happen,' Méndez said, 'we're being lucky.' For poultry farmers, the outbreak has already come at a significant economic cost, striking tens of millions of birds in the United States. For wildlife, it threatens to disrupt ecosystems and push endangered animals closer to the brink of extinction. 'We've never seen such a massive spread of virus in wild birds, and we've never seen such massive infections of wild mammals,' said Ron Fouchier, a virologist at the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands. The trajectory of the virus, unprecedented both in its global spread and in the number of species infected, shows how dependent and connected humanity is to the natural world - and how farming practices that facilitate the flu can disrupt it. 'I was not prepared' Scientists first spotted the precursor to this flu strain in commercial geese in southern China in 1996. Over the next several years, it spread to poultry farms in the region, popping up occasionally in wild birds within flight range of infected farms. Then, in 2005, some 1,500 wild geese and gulls dropped dead in a protected nature reserve in northwestern China, far from any poultry coops. The virus had found its way into the wild bird population. From there, the virus rapidly spread across Asia, Africa and Europe, popping up in seasonal outbreaks. But it was only after a genetic change that allowed the pathogen to spread in migrating birds around 2021 that the numbers of outbreaks exploded and the virus went global, establishing itself in North America that year and in South America the following. Since then, the death toll has been staggering. About 5,200 common cranes in Israel. More than 2,200 Dalmatian pelicans in Greece, about 40 percent of the species in southeastern Europe, and roughly 20,000 Sandwich terns in Europe, 17 percent of the northwest European breeding population. More than 18,000 dead barnacle geese in Scotland. And tens of thousands of gannets in Canada. Last year, ornithologists found about 12,000 dead black-legged kittiwakes in Norway. By July, more than 500,000 birds died in South America, including about 41 percent of all Peruvian pelicans. Flu symptoms depend on the bird, according to Jonas Waldenström, a disease ecology professor at Linnaeus University in Sweden. Telltale signs include tilting heads, struggling to stand and tumbling when trying to take flight - all signs the virus has hit the nervous system. 'In some species, it's pretty ugly,' he said. The virus is literally reaching the ends of the Earth, killing brown skuas on islands near Antarctica and, for the first time just this winter, a polar bear in Alaska. Scientists worry it is only a matter of time before it reaches penguins and other vulnerable populations on Antarctica itself. 'The Antarctic situation is at a precipice,' said Michelle Wille, a virus ecologist at the University of Melbourne. 'Many of the animal species that live there are found nowhere else in the world, and many are already facing substantial pressures due to things like fisheries and climate change.' Scientists say the disease can jump between species when a wild animal eats a dead or dying bird, or when bird poop plops into a farm animal's feed. So far, bird flu has infected coyotes, lions, tigers, grizzlies, raccoons, red foxes and other terrestrial mammals, but only sporadically. And it has also struck farms for mink and fox fur in Spain and Finland. But a series of mass die-offs of marine mammals that congregate on beaches has biologists worried about the possibility of the virus evolving to spread directly from one mammal to another. Last year, more than 5,000 sea lions were found dead in Peru. And more than 17,000 elephant seal pups succumbed to the virus in Argentina, representing at least 96 percent of the juvenile population. Nursing seal pups likely would not have caught the flu by eating birds. They instead may have gotten it from contaminated milk, water, aerosol or feces, Fouchier said. Valeria Falabella, a Wildlife Conservation Society marine biologist who has studied Argentina's elephant seals for decades, had only ever seen a dead adult once before this flu outbreak. Seeing beaches of dozens dead was 'absolutely devastating.' 'I was not prepared to see that,' Falabella said. The risk to people If a bird flu virus evolves to spread between seals, it is more likely to spread within other mammal populations, such as humans. 'It's quite a distance from a gannet to human,' Waldenström said. 'But from a seal to a human, we're pretty much alike.' Tracing how viruses hop between species is hard. In the past, humans have caught disease from animals after working on farms (the 1918 flu pandemic likely started in Kansas farm country) or after encroaching into wilderness (HIV likely jumped from chimpanzees when a hunter killed one for meat). In the case of the latest flu strain, it is 'very difficult to prove mammal-to-mammal transmission,' Fouchier said, adding that a genetic analysis of the virus found in the dead seals could provide clues about transmission. So far, what we know about this strain of avian flu suggests an outbreak among humans is not imminent. The adaptation that the virus made to replicate in migratory birds - and thus spread across the globe - seems to have inhibited its ability to infect humans, Fouchier said. 'It is slightly less concerning to human health at present,' he said, compared to past flu viruses. But given the unprecedented nature of the ongoing outbreak it's hard to predict how it will evolve. 'A typical bird flu virus never makes it into mammals at this scale,' he added. The longer the virus persists in the environment, the more opportunities it has to fuel a new pandemic. Influenza viruses evolve much faster than the coronavirus behind the covid pandemic and other pathogens. Right now, there is little to do to stop the spread of this flu virus among wildlife. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for instance, is working with zoos to vaccinate critically endangered California condors. 'It's hard to contain a virus that's now on more or less all the continents,' Waldenström said. 'There's no putting the lid on that. It will run its course.' But there are steps the poultry industry can take - monitoring for viruses at farms, disinfecting equipment, having workers wear protective gear - to reduce the risk of future outbreaks, according to Jonathan Sleeman, a science adviser for wildlife health at the U.S. Geological Survey. 'One recognizes that this is a lot of effort,' he said. For the surviving elephant seal population in Argentina, it may take years to come back. 'They may never recover to the same level of population as they were before,' Sleeman said. Biologists are working to understand how many adult seals died. Méndez, the biologist who likened the seal die-off to a disaster movie, worries how the recent outbreak may undo decades of conservation work. Now, the virus has transformed their work. It's about more than just aiding faraway animals - it's about protecting people, too. 'We're really trying to protect the very functioning of our planet,' Méndez said. 'We're looking at this disruption through the lens of wildlife, but this is obviously very serious for humans as well. animals and the ways in which we appreciate, imperil and depend on them. http://www.washingtonpost.com WP20240123AVIANFLU", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "But a series of mass die-offs of marine mammals that congregate on beaches has biologists worried about the possibility of the virus evolving to spread directly from one mammal to another.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "But the possibility of the quickly evolving influenza virus gaining the ability to be transmitted between from one mammal to another - and eventually, to humans - has scientists concerned about the pathogen turning into another pandemic.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "If a bird flu virus evolves to spread between seals, it is more likely to spread within other mammal populations, such as humans.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "The longer the virus persists in the environment, the more opportunities it has to fuel a new pandemic.", "affirm_why_statement_4": "Influenza viruses evolve much faster than the coronavirus behind the covid pandemic and other pathogens.", "affirm_why_statement_5": "But given the unprecedented nature of the ongoing outbreak it's hard to predict how it will evolve.", "affirm_why_count": 5, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "Altogether, an estimated 17,000 elephant seal pups seals died there last year from avian influenza, victims of an unprecedented panzootic - a pandemic among animals - that has struck around 320 types of birds and mammals.", "affirm_keywords_count": 1, "deny_transmissible_statement_3": "'It is slightly less concerning to human health at present,' he said, compared to past flu viruses.", "deny_transmissible_count": 1, "deny_why_statement_1": "The adaptation that the virus made to replicate in migratory birds - and thus spread across the globe - seems to have inhibited its ability to infect humans, Fouchier said.", "deny_why_statement_2": "So far, what we know about this strain of avian flu suggests an outbreak among humans is not imminent.", "deny_why_count": 2, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "372", "title": "Avian flu is devastating farms in California's 'Egg Basket' as outbreaks roil poultry industry", "date": "2024-01-27", "fulltext": "PETALUMA, Calif. (AP) Last month, Mike Weber got the news every poultry farmer fears: His chickens tested positive for avian flu. Following government rules, Weber's company, Sunrise Farms, had to slaughter its entire flock of egg-laying hens—50,000 birds—to prevent the disease from infecting other farms in Sonoma County north of San Francisco. It's a trauma. We're all going through grief as a result of it, said Weber, standing in an empty hen house. Petaluma is known as the Egg Basket of the World. It's devastating to see that egg basket go up in flames. A year after the bird flu led to record egg prices and widespread shortages, the disease known as highly pathogenic avian influenza is wreaking havoc in California, which escaped the earlier wave of outbreaks that devastated poultry farms in the Midwest. The highly contagious virus has ravaged Sonoma County, where officials have declared a state of emergency. During the past two months, nearly a dozen commercial farms have had to destroy more than 1 million birds to control the outbreak, dealing an economic blow to farmers, workers and their customers. Merced County in Central California also has been hit hard, with outbreaks at several large commercial egg-producing farms in recent weeks. Experts say bird flu is spread by ducks, geese and other migratory birds. The waterfowl can carry the virus without getting sick and easily spread it through their droppings to chicken and turkey farms and backyard flocks through droppings and nasal discharges. California poultry farms are implementing strict biosecurity measures to curb the spread of the disease. State Veterinarian Annette Jones urged farmers to keep their flocks indoors until June, including organic chickens that are required to have outdoor access. We still have migration going for another couple of months. So we've got to be as vigilant as possible to protect our birds, said Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation. The loss of local hens led to a spike in egg prices in the San Francisco Bay Area over the holidays before supermarkets and restaurants found suppliers from outside the region. While bird flu has been around for decades, the current outbreak of the virus that began in early 2022 has prompted officials to slaughter nearly 82 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens, in 47 U.S. states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Whenever the disease is found the entire flock is slaughtered to help limit the spread of the virus. The price of a dozen eggs more than doubled to $4.82 at its peak in January 2023. Egg prices returned to their normal range as egg producers built up their flocks and outbreaks were controlled. Turkey and chicken prices also spiked, partly due to the virus. I think this is an existential issue for the commercial poultry industry. The virus is on every continent, except for Australia at this point, said Maurice Pitesky, a poultry expert at the University of California, Davis. Climate change is increasing the risk of outbreaks as changing weather patterns disrupt the migratory patterns of wild birds, Pitesky said. For example, exceptional rainfall last year created new waterfowl habitat throughout California, including areas close to poultry farms. In California, the outbreak has impacted more than 7 million chickens in about 40 commercial flocks and 24 backyard flocks, with most of the outbreaks occurring over the past two months on the North Coast and Central Valley, according to the USDA. Industry officials are worried about the growing number of backyard chickens that could become infected and spread avian flu to commercial farms. We have wild birds that are full of virus. And if you expose your birds to these wild birds, they might get infected and ill, said Rodrigo Gallardo, a UC Davis researcher who studies avian influenza. Gallardo advises the owners of backyard chickens to wear clean clothes and shoes to protect their flocks from getting infected. If an unusual number of chickens die, they should be tested for avian flu. Ettamarie Peterson, a retired teacher in Petaluma, has a flock of about 50 chickens that produce eggs she sells from her backyard barn for 50 cents each. I'm very concerned because this avian flu is transmitted by wild birds, and there's no way I can stop the wild birds from coming through and leaving the disease behind, Peterson said. If your flock has any cases of it, you have to destroy the whole flock. Sunrise Farms, which was started by Weber's great-grandparents more than a century ago, was infected despite putting in place strict biosecurity measures to protect the flock. The virus got to the birds so bad and so quickly you walked in and the birds were just dead, Weber said. Heartbreaking doesn't describe how you feel when you walk in and perfectly healthy young birds have been just laid out. After euthanizing more than half a million chickens at Sunrise Farms, Weber and his employees spent the Christmas holiday discarding the carcasses. Since then, they've been cleaning out and disinfecting the hen houses. Weber hopes the farm will get approval from federal regulators to bring chicks back to the farm this spring. Then it would take another five months before the hens are mature enough to lay eggs. He feels lucky that two farms his company co-owns have not been infected and are still producing eggs for his customers. But recovering from the outbreak won't be easy. We have a long road ahead, Weber said. We're going to make another run of it and try to keep this family of employees together because they've worked so hard to build this into the company that it is.

{"id": "374", "title": "First penguins die in Antarctic of deadly H5N1 bird flu strain", "date": "2024-01-29", "fulltext": "With confirmed or suspected cases in two Antarctic penguin species, researchers fear highly contagious virus could rip through colonies. At least one king penguin is suspected to have died from bird flu in the Antarctic. If confirmed, it will be the first of the species killed by the highly contagious H5N1 virus in the wild. Researchers have previously raised alarm about 'one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times' if bird flu reached remote Antarctic penguin populations. The birds are currently clustering together for breeding season, meaning the disease could rip through entire colonies if it continues to spread through the region. King penguins are the world's second-largest penguin, at about 3ft tall, and can live for more than 20 years in the wild. The suspected case was recorded on South Georgia island in the Antarctic region, according to the latest update from the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (Scar). A gentoo penguin was also suspected to have died from H5N1 at the same location. Separately, at least one gentoo penguin has been confirmed to have died from H5N1 on the Falkland Islands 500 miles (1,500km) west of South Georgia with more than 20 chicks either dead or also showing symptoms. Since H5N1 arrived in the Antarctic, there have been mass deaths of elephant seals as well as increased deaths of fur seals, kelp gulls and brown skua in the region. Previous outbreaks in South Africa, Chile and Argentina show penguins are susceptible to the disease. Since it arrived in South America, more than 500,000 seabirds have died of it, with penguins, pelicans and boobies among those most heavily affected. Ed Hutchinson, a molecular virologist at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said: 'The arrival of this H5N1 virus in the Antarctic towards the end of last year rang alarm bells because of the risk it posed to wildlife in this fragile ecosystem. And while it is very sad to hear reports of penguins dying it is unfortunately not at all surprising.' Diana Bell, emeritus professor of conservation biology at the University of East Anglia, said she had feared something like this would happen. 'I'm just devastated, really as will everybody who cares about penguins and the Antarctic given their colonial social organisation, you just wonder how quickly it would go through the colonies.' So far, there are no recorded cases on the Antarctic mainland, according to Scar mapping data, but this could be because there are so few people present to record possible fatalities. Avian flu adds to the pressures already faced in these pristine polar ecosystems. A study in 2018 warned that the climate crisis and overfishing meant Antarctica's king penguins 'could disappear by the end of the century.' The disease is also ripping through wildlife populations in the Arctic. In December, it was confirmed that for the first time a polar bear had died of H5N1. As with penguins, it is possible that more bears have died unnoticed as they tend to live in remote places with few people.

{"id": "375", "title": "First Bird Flu Deaths Reported in Antarctic Penguins: Dead gentoo penguins tested positive for the virus, and at least one suspected case has been reported in king penguins.", "date": "2024-01-30", "fulltext": "Dead gentoo penguins tested positive for the virus, and at least one suspected case has been reported in king penguins. The News A highly lethal form of bird flu has been detected in Antarctic penguins for the first time. The virus, which is known as H5N1, was confirmed in two gentoo penguins that were found dead on Sea Lion Island in the Falkland Islands, a British territory. 'But many more are dying,' said Sally Heathman, the head of communications for the Falkland Islands government. As of January 30, more than 200 dead or dying gentoo chicks have been reported on Sea Lion Island, she said. Why It Matters: Penguins are already under pressure. The familiar black-and-white birds are facing numerous threats, including climate change, pollution and commercial fishing. Three Antarctic penguin species—emperor penguins, southern rockhopper penguins and macaroni penguins—are listed as vulnerable or near threatened. Before H5N1 arrived in the Antarctic region last fall, highly pathogenic bird flu viruses had never been documented in the area before. That means that the penguins are likely to have little existing immunity. And because they breed in large, crowded colonies, once one penguin is infected, the virus could spread rapidly, causing mass mortalities. (As the virus spread through South America last year, Chile reported the deaths of thousands of Humboldt penguins.) The extent of the virus's spread in Antarctic penguin populations remains unclear. In the Falkland Islands, some gentoo penguins appeared to be sick or lethargic, and a small number showed neurological symptoms, before they were found dead, Ms. Heathman said. The virus has not yet been confirmed in any other local penguin species, she said, but testing of rockhopper penguins is underway. At least one suspected case has also been reported in king penguins in South Georgia, another British territory, according to the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network, which is part of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. That report was based on a single dead king penguin, and investigators have not seen a spike in penguin deaths at that location, said Laura Willis, the chief executive of the government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. 'We are monitoring the situation across the islands,' she said. Background: Scientists have been worried about the spread of the virus in Antarctica. The virus, which first emerged in 2020, has taken an unprecedented toll on wild birds and mammals. After the virus was detected at the tip of South America last year, OFFLU, a global network of flu experts, warned that the pathogen could spread to Antarctica next. The Antarctic region provides critical breeding territory for more than 100 million birds as well as seals, sea lions and other marine mammals. If the virus arrived in the region, its impact on those animals 'could be immense,' OFFLU said in a statement last August. Just two months later, the virus was detected in brown skuas in South Georgia, the first cases in the region. Since then, infections have been confirmed in numerous other bird species, as well as in elephant and fur seals. These marine mammals also breed in large colonies, and they suffered major losses as the virus spread through South America, where tens of thousands of seals and sea lions were reported dead. Scientists worry that the same fate may befall Antarctica's seals as the virus spreads. Infections have not yet been reported on the Antarctic mainland, although experts have said that the virus may already be spreading there undetected.

The 9-year-old's death in the northeastern province of Kratie was the first from bird flu in Cambodia this year, after four were reported last year by the World Health Organization. Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, normally spreads in poultry and wasn't deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak among visitors to poultry markets in Hong Kong. Most human cases have involved direct contact with infected poultry, but there have been concerns that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people. The WHO and the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization this month warned that Lunar New Year festivities celebrated in much of Asia posed an increased risk of spreading the virus. In a statement, Cambodia's Health Ministry said the 16-year-old brother tested positive for the virus on Sunday but exhibited no symptoms. The boy was undergoing medical treatment, and officials are investigating who had contact with the brothers and how and where they contracted the virus. The Health Ministry said the boy who died last week fell ill with fever, shortness of breath, coughing and fainting after eating a meal his parents had cooked from chicken and ducks they raised.

{"id": "377", "title": "Antarctica's Penguins Could Be Devastated by Avian Influenza", "date": "2024-02-12", "fulltext": "A new kind of death is coming to Antarctica, scientists fear. The harsh environment is full of everyday heartbreak: predation, starvation, chicks that are lost at sea when their icy shoreline melts away. Now a novel pathogen threatens to rip through colonies of marine mammals and birds, potentially including penguins. If the very worst happens, it could make ghosts of entire species—and scientists can’t do much more than wait. A deadly strain of H5N1 avian influenza has been blazing through poultry farms and flocks of wild birds around the world, infecting mammals and even killing at least one polar bear. Now it’s knocking at the gates of Antarctica, just as dozens of species that have likely never experienced any strain of avian influenza are congregating to raise their next generation. Avian influenza is currently causing big outbreaks on islands around the southern tip of South America, about 1,000 miles from the Antarctic Peninsula. The virus has led to clusters of illness in Gentoo Penguins on the Falkland Islands in January and in fur seals, elephant seals and other animals on the island of South Georgia last December. Scientists fear it will just require a short jump for the virus to hit the Antarctic Peninsula and spread into the rest of the continent. \"We’re kind of braced for impact. We’ve been like that since basically the end of [last] year,\" says Marcela Uhart, a wildlife veterinarian at the University of California, Davis, who is currently monitoring the outbreak from Patagonia. \"It is unlikely that [avian influenza] will not get there just because of how connected the species are,\" with the animals often traveling long distances through the Southern Ocean to find food. Avian influenzas come in two varieties. Typically, wild birds catch mild cases of what scientists call \"low-pathogenicity\" flu, whereas farmed poultry species such as chickens and ducks can develop much more serious infections with \"high-pathogenicity\" strains. These different flavors can mix, creating more infectious viruses such as the one currently ravaging South America. That combination, a substrain called clade 2.3.4.4b that developed within the past decade, comes from a lineage identified in China in the mid-1990s that has led to occasional outbreaks around the world. But clade 2.3.4.4b has now become a Frankenstein virus that combines the severe disease of poultry strains with a particular affinity for infecting wild birds. In addition to hitting South America, the virus has devastated seabird colonies in Europe, followed migratory birds south into Africa and jumped the Atlantic Ocean to infect even the regal California Condor. \"Avian influenza is nothing new; it’s been around for a very, very long time,\" says Christian Walzer, a wildlife veterinarian and executive director of health at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. But this avian influenza is different. \"What’s important to understand is that the whole dynamics have changed,\" he says. Despite the rapid spread of this strain, scientists aren’t sure how it is transmitted between animals, particularly how it spreads between birds and mammals. Many infected species are scavengers, suggesting that consumption of infected corpses could contribute to transmission; healthy animals may also pick up the virus from the feces of infected ones, researchers say. Some species seem to be resistant to sickness, although they could still be contributing to transmission. \"The big problem we have is: we don’t really understand how some birds are able to be infected with this virus and not get sick, but it’s clear that that does happen,\" says Ashley Banyard, a virologist at the U.K.’s Animal and Plant Health Agency. By late 2022 and into 2023, the brutal clade 2.3.4.4b virus in South America had killed at least about 600,000 birds and 50,000 mammals—and likely many more, scientists say. \"We’ve never had anything of this magnitude in the Southern Hemisphere,\" Uhart says. Antarctica and Australia are currently the only continents this avian influenza has yet to reach—as far as scientists can tell. For Antarctica in particular, the virus may simply be spreading undetected. \"There is no way to know for sure,\" says Michelle Wille, a viral ecologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, who focuses on avian viruses. \"One of the great challenges is that it could already be there, in a place where few people visit.\" Detecting any wildlife infection in a remote location is difficult work, but that’s particularly true when most victims are ocean-based species. \"It’s really hard to detect anything at sea,\" says Amandine Gamble, an ecologist at Cornell University. \"It’s probably a huge underestimate of the actual number of fatalities.\" Scientists are worried that if the virus takes hold in Antarctica, casualties on the continent could be particularly high. \"Highly pathogenic avian influenza has never been recorded there before,\" says Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist at the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \"The majority of the 48 species of birds and 26 species of marine mammals present in Antarctica are likely susceptible to infection and disease from this virus.\" Not only are these animals immunologically vulnerable, but they also have lifestyles that put them at additional risk of infection. \"You have these massive, densely packed together bird colonies and some of those megacharismatic, highly threatened species, which are all packed together down there,\" such as penguins, Walzer says. \"If [the virus] does hit, the impacts will be potentially really devastating.\" \"Entire populations may disappear,\" Wille says of a potential Antarctic outbreak. \"This would be a catastrophe.\" It could be a catastrophe for species beyond those directly affected—and even beyond those that call Antarctica home, Uhart says. For instance, if there are mass die-offs on the continent, and these corpses become encased in ice rather than sink into the ocean, the deaths could potentially affect the global carbon cycle and nutrient flow. \"I don’t think anybody can even imagine what the loss of potentially this huge biomass of wildlife would mean for the ocean,\" Uhart says. \"I don’t think we understand what this means.\" Timing could influence just how bad an Antarctic avian influenza outbreak could be, experts say. Currently, the continent is at the peak of its summer, with many species still busy raising their young—those fresh immune systems could be more susceptible to avian influenza or more likely to spread it, scientists say. \"Now is a critical stage,\" Gamble says. \"If it actually reaches now, it can be very, very fast to spread,\" she says. \"If we manage to not have the virus reaching the Antarctic continent for a few more weeks, we might be safe for this year.\" Most species will disperse out of tightly packed colonies until the next breeding season, making them less likely to encounter other animals—and therefore the virus. Still, Gamble and others worry that would likely be only a temporary stay, given how aggressively the virus is circulating globally. Antarctica may dodge the crisis this year, only to suffer during the next Southern Hemisphere spring and summer. As with so many ecological disasters, the story of avian influenza highlights the consequences of human disruption of the natural world, scientists say. Modern poultry farming, where birds are packed even more tightly than the most crowded penguin colony, fosters the spread of disease. And although several avian influenza vaccines exist, countries around the world have typically opted to instead kill any farm’s entire population after exposure. Tens of millions of chickens have died or been culled in the U.S. alone since 2022. That decision has been driven by fears that vaccinated chickens would interfere with international trade because tests can’t distinguish between infected and vaccinated birds. Nations that don’t vaccinate won’t import poultry with a positive avian flu test. And now, Uhart says, it’s sea lions and elephant seals, cormorants and pelicans and, yes, even penguins that are suffering from this vicious virus. \"These poor animals are dying without a voice,\" she says. \"Unless we tell their story, it could very well go untold.\"", "media_outlet": "SciAm", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_4": "Healthy animals may also pick up the virus from the feces of infected ones, researchers say.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_6": "Now is a critical stage, if it actually reaches now, it can be very, very fast to spread.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 2, "affirm_why_statement_1": "These different flavors can mix, creating more infectious viruses such as the one currently ravaging South America.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "But clade 2.3.4.4b has now become a Frankenstein virus that combines the severe disease of poultry strains with a particular affinity for infecting wild birds.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "Despite the rapid spread of this strain, scientists aren’t sure how it is transmitted between animals, particularly how it spreads between birds and mammals.", "affirm_why_statement_4": "Many infected species are scavengers, suggesting that consumption of infected corpses could contribute to transmission; healthy animals may also pick up the virus from the feces of infected ones, researchers say.", "affirm_why_statement_5": "Some species seem to be resistant to sickness, although they could still be contributing to transmission.", "affirm_why_statement_6": "The big problem we have is: we don’t really understand how some birds are able to be infected with this virus and not get sick, but it’s clear that that does happen.", "affirm_why_statement_7": "Modern poultry farming, where birds are packed even more tightly than the most crowded penguin colony, fosters the spread of disease.", "affirm_why_count": 7, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "378", "title": "Bird flu causing �catastrophic� fall in UK seabird numbers, conservationists warn", "date": "2024-02-13", "fulltext": "Report by RSPB and British Trust for Ornithology finds H5N1 has caused a loss of 75% of the great skua population and a 25% decline in northern gannets. The UK has lost more than three-quarters of its great skuas on surveyed sites since bird flu struck, according to the first report quantifying the impact of H5N1 on seabird populations. The deaths have happened over two years, since the outbreak of H5N1 in 2021. The UK is internationally important for seabirds, home to most of the world's 16,000 pairs of nesting great skuas. Jean Duggan, a policy assistant on avian influenza for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), said: 'To have that level of loss in a population we have international responsibility for is quite catastrophic. Globally, it's very significant and has a knock-on effect for populations across the globe,' he said. The UK also has more than half of the world's northern gannets, which declined by 25% in the sites surveyed, according to the report by the RSPB, the British Trust for Ornithology and other conservation bodies. Gannets nest in a small number of large colonies, which means they are particularly vulnerable to the spread of disease. In Wales, the number of nesting northern gannets crashed by 54%. 'For the gannets and great skuas, we knew it was bad, but it's worse than we thought,' said Duggan. The report also found the virus had caused a 21% decline in the UK population of roseate terns, which is the UK's rarest breeding seabird, with just one regular nesting colony. Seabirds are typically long-lived animals that do not reach breeding age until they are about five years old. They generally only have a few chicks, so populations take longer to recover from an epidemic such as bird flu. The H5N1 outbreak is thought to have killed millions of wild birds and has most recently been recorded among penguins in the Antarctic. H5N1 is 'one of the biggest immediate conservation threats faced by multiple seabird species across the UK and continental Europe,' the report warned. Populations of great skuas, northern gannets and roseate terns were increasing before avian flu struck, so researchers are able to pin the declines on bird flu. Declines in populations of sandwich and common terns by 35% and 42% respectively were also likely to be largely driven by bird flu, the report found. In total, nine of the 13 species covered in the report had decreased by more than 10%, but many were already in decline before bird flu so it is not clear to what degree the virus was to blame. Conservationists monitored seabirds for this latest report from May to July 2023. Even more birds died later in the summer, with black-headed gulls, guillemots and kittiwakes particularly badly hit. This meant the impact of bird flu was 'likely to be worse than indicated here,' the report warned. 'There is also the potential for ongoing impacts as the disease progresses,' researchers wrote. The latest Seabirds Count survey, published last November which did not take into account the impact of bird flu found almost 62% of seabirds were already in decline across the UK, driven by unsustainable fishing practices, the climate crisis, offshore windfarms and invasive mammal species. Katie-Jo Luxton, RSPB's director of conservation, said: 'This new study shows that bird flu can be added to the long list of things that are devastating our seabirds.' The RSPB is calling for action to reduce other pressures on seabirds so their populations are more robust and better able to cope with H5N1. Duggan said: 'We had the census and now we have this. We need to act now; it's about building resilience.' In October, scientists confirmed that some wild birds had developed immunity to avian flu.

Joni Ernst is demanding information about President Biden's Department of Agriculture spending $1 million in US taxpayer funds on 'dangerous bird flu experiments' in cooperation with the Chinese government — and a researcher connected to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, according to a letter exclusively obtained by The Post. Ernst (R-Iowa) wrote to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack on Wednesday for details about the project, which involves 'a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus' and is being conducted 'in collaboration' with the UK, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wenjun Liu, a researcher 'affiliated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology's Center for Biosafety Mega-Science Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens.' The Biden administration awarded the $1 million grant from April 2021 to March 2026 for 'wet-lab virology' experiments involving 'strains of avian influenza virus' that 'pose the greatest risk to avian or human populations.' Sen. Joni Ernst is demanding information about President Biden's Department of Agriculture spending $1 million in US taxpayer funds on 'dangerous bird flu experiments' in cooperation with the Chinese government. Getty Images The Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing will help with tests to infect vaccinated chickens, mallard ducks, species of Chinese geese and Japanese quail to evaluate the virus's transmissibility and 'potential to jump into mammalian hosts.' Ernst told Vilsack to hand over any departmental information about whether there are any safeguards in place, if the experiments constitute risky gain-of-function research, and what portion is being done in China. Gain-of-function research involves experimentation that aims to increase the transmissibility or virulence of pathogens in order to understand their potential to cause pandemics. 'The health and safety of Americans are too important to just wing it, and Biden's USDA should have had more apprehension before sending any taxpayer dollars to collaborate with the CCP on risky avian flu research,' Ernst told The Post in a statement. 'They should know by now to suspect 'fowl' play when it comes to researchers who have ties to the dangerous Wuhan Lab, and simply switching from bats to birds causes concern that they are creating more pathogens of pandemic potential,' she added, referring to risky experiments that may have led to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 'highly pathogenic avian influenza virus' research is being conducted with the UK and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (above). AFP via Getty Images 'Here's my warning: The Biden administration should be walking on eggshells until they cut off every cent going to our adversaries. We cannot allow what happened in Wuhan to happen again.' Such viral experiments have 'already caused outbreaks and killed humans,' Ernst also wrote to Vilsack, noting that 'China's labs have notoriously lax safety standards.' Other bird flu testing will take place at the USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Athens, Ga., while the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute will complete statistical modeling for the experiments. Federal grant data portals show the award date was Jan. 26, 2021, and $632,813.50 has been doled out so far. Ernst told USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack (above) to hand over any departmental information about whether there are any safeguards in place, if the experiments constitute risky gain-of-function research and what portion is being done in China. REUTERS Performance dates for the 60-month project stretch from April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2026. USDA spokesperson Allan Rodriguez accused Ernst of spreading 'misinformation' by not reaching out to the department directly about the research and said the 'project was applied for in 2019 and was approved in 2020.' 'USDA's funding is only being committed to the specific components carried out by our own team located in Athens, Georgia, and is not [in] any way contributing to research taking place in the UK or China,' Rodriguez said. 'Because animal diseases present a global threat, it is common for international researchers to conduct independent research that's connected to the same end goal — but what Senator Ernst lays out in her letter is far off base from what's actually transpiring, and on top of that is based on approval decisions that predate this Administration.' 'Here's my warning: The Biden administration should be walking on eggshells until they cut off every cent going to our adversaries,' Ernst said. 'We cannot allow what happened in Wuhan to happen again.' REUTERS Diane Cutler, a former grant fraud investigator for the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, told The Post it was 'disingenuous for USDA to insinuate that its research is separate and is not contributing to the research in China when clearly an official collaboration to conduct this research has been established within USDA's system of records.' Ernst said the nonprofit taxpayer watchdog group White Coat Waste Project alerted her to the alarming experiments. The group's senior vice president, Justin Goodman, said Congress should use the upcoming farm bill to cut off funding to 'unaccountable animal labs' in China and Russia for good. Last year, a federal government report on National Institutes of Health and US Agency for International Development subgrants found more than $2 million in taxpayer funds flowed to Chinese research institutions in Wuhan. That included more than $1.4 million to the Manhattan-based EcoHealth Alliance, which went on to fund 'genetic experiments to combine naturally occurring bat coronaviruses with SARS and MERS viruses, resulting in hybridized (also known as chimeric) coronavirus strains' at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Former US intelligence officials, the FBI, Energy Department, and scientific experts believe the pandemic most likely began when the virus leaked out of a lab in Wuhan, where research institutions were known to have conducted gain-of-function experiments.

AFP via Getty Images Rutgers University molecular biologist Dr. Richard Ebright previously told The Post that those experiments violated federal policies governing research on both gain-of-function and enhanced potential pandemic pathogen research. EcoHealth has maintained it never conducted gain-of-function research and that its work in Wuhan has been misrepresented. Ernst and Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), who chairs the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, last month demanded a separate investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general into more than $50 million in defense grants that funded Chinese pandemic research labs. The NIH in October 2021 admitted that EcoHealth had not complied with the terms of its grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and the Department of Health and Human Services two years later barred the lab from US funding for the next 10 years. The White House told The Post on Wednesday that it is being 'vigilant' about potentially dangerous scientific research conducted in China after a study from Beijing resulted in a coronavirus variant that killed 100% of 'humanized' mice. 'We've documented in the past over many years concerns about biosafety, biosecurity practices of a number of countries, China being one of them,' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in response to The Post's question about the study during the daily press briefing. Wenju Liu, a researcher connected to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is named on the grant project proposal. Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences 'That's something we continue to be vigilant about because biosafety and biosecurity, particularly of hazardous biosubstances anywhere in the world, can ultimately come back and harm Americans.' According to Ernst and Gallagher, however, the US is still funding tens of millions of dollars' worth in viral research abroad.

{"id": "380", "title": "Scientists confirm first cases of bird flu on mainland Antarctica", "date": "2024-02-26", "fulltext": "Fears for penguin colonies after the discovery of the highly contagious H5N1 virus in two dead skuas Bird flu has reached mainland of Antarctica for the first time, officials have confirmed. The H5N1 virus was found on Friday in two dead scavenging birds called skuas near Primavera Base, the Argentinian scientific research station on the Antarctic peninsula. Additional suspected cases have been reported in brown skua, south polar skua and kelp gull in Hope Bay, also on the Antarctic peninsula, according to data from the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. 'This discovery demonstrates for the first time that the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has reached Antarctica, despite the distance and natural barriers that separate it from other continents,' said a Spanish government report on Sunday. These are the first confirmed cases on the continent itself, which shows the virus is spreading in the region, most likely via migratory birds. This H5N1 outbreak is thought to have killed millions of wild birds globally since 2021, and has spread to every continent except Oceania. Avian flu reached the wider Antarctic region in October last year when it was reported on sub-Antarctic islands. The virus was first detected on the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, about 1,000 miles (1,600km) away from the continent of Antarctica. It was also found in the Falkland Islands, which is 600 miles north-west of South Georgia. Initially it was reported in birds such as gulls, skuas and terns, but has since been found in albatross, penguins and southern fulmars. It has also spread to Antarctic mammals, with mass deaths of elephant seals and fur seals. The virus is also ripping through wildlife populations in the Arctic. In December, it was confirmed that the first polar bear had died of H5N1. 'There are many reports now of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) affecting several species in the Antarctic regions this season,' said Matthew Dryden from the UK Health Security Agency. 'It may not have been reported on the Antarctic mainland until now because of the difficulties of accessing and sampling wildlife [there].' The dead birds from mainland Antarctica were found by Argentinian scientists and sent to scientists from the Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa in Madrid, who were working at the Spanish Antarctic base on Deception Island. 'The problem is how long is it going to take before it transmits to other species like penguins. We need to monitor that,' said Antonio Alcamí, a researcher from the Spanish National Research Council who works at the Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa CSIC, who is based at the Spanish Antarctic base and tested the carcasses. 'I'm afraid I think it probably will transmit into penguins. The skuas live pretty close, and so there are many opportunities for transmission, but we will see.' Previous outbreaks in South Africa, Chile and Argentina have shown that penguins are susceptible to the virus. Since H5N1 arrived in South America, more than 500,000 seabirds have died of the disease, with penguins, pelicans and boobies among the most heavily affected. Researchers wrote in a pre-print research paper in November last year: 'If the virus does start to cause mass mortality events across penguin colonies, it could signal one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times.' Diana Bell, the emeritus professor of conservation biology at the University of East Anglia, said the news was 'sadly not surprising, given its previously reported presence on Antarctic islands in birds and elephant seals. It seems unlikely that the penguins there will not be infected.' Dryden added: 'Biosecurity is important so that humans are not exposed to the virus. HPAI can rarely infect humans but close, prolonged contact is required.' While a number of wildlife sites had been closed to tourists to limit spread of the virus, Dryden said, little else could be done to stop it spreading.

Researchers on Saturday confirmed the presence of the H5 subtype of avian influenza in two dead seabirds, called skuas, near an Argentine base and scientific research station on the Antarctic Peninsula, according to the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). This discovery demonstrates for the first time that the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has reached Antarctica, despite the distance and natural barriers that separate it from other continents, officials said Sunday. Over the past several years, the highly infectious disease has devastated both wild and domestic animal populations, making its way around the globe on the migratory routes of birds. Now the arrival of avian influenza on the southernmost continent threatens its unique wildlife, including its iconic penguins. The virus has proved potent enough to jump from birds to mammals, striking elephant seals and other marine mammals that congregate on shore. It has made its way to every continent except Australia. We've never seen such a massive spread of virus in wild birds, and we've never seen such massive infections of wild mammals, Ron Fouchier, a virologist at the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, said last month. For farms, the global outbreak poses a high economic cost as the virus kills millions of chickens and other poultry birds. In the wild, the disease is threatening to upend ecosystems and edge endangered birds closer to extinction. Why penguins are at riskPenguins on Antarctica may not have much immunity to the disease, since the virus has not been documented on the continent until now. Outbreaks among penguins in South America and Africa show their vulnerability. The birds, which like to waddle together in packed colonies, are not particularly good at social distancing. Many penguins in Antarctica are already at risk of dying as rising temperatures deplete the sea ice they need to feed, breed and defend themselves. In 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the continent's emperor penguins are threatened with extinction due to climate change. CSIC said scientists obtained samples from the two dead skuas using maximum security measures to prevent transmission of the virus to people, sending them by ship to the Spanish base on Deception Island for testing. Avian influenza has been creeping toward the continent for months. There have been other suspected cases of bird flu on Antarctica in recent weeks, according to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. To many scientists, its arrival seemed inevitable. In October, British scientists found the virus in brown skuas roughly 1,000 miles from Antarctica, on Bird Island in the British territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. And in January, on the Falkland Islands off the coast of Argentina, researchers found the flu in Gentoo penguins for the first time.

{"id": "383", "title": "Bird flu: access to Ernest Shackleton� grave �locked by dead seals�", "date": "2024-03-14", "fulltext": "Exclusive: The H5N1 virus reached the region late last year and is killing wildlife, with witnesses spotting numerous seal corpses on South Georgia island. The grave of the explorer Ernest Shackleton on South Georgia island has become inaccessible to visitors due to bodies of dead seals blocking the way as increasing numbers of animals are killed by bird flu spread through the Antarctic. The H5N1 virus has spread to 10 species of birds and mammals since it arrived in the region last October, with five king penguins and five gentoo penguins the latest to test positive on the sub-Antarctic islands. Those confirmations follow reports of mass die-offs of elephant seals at the end of last year. Astrid Saunders, a racing journalist who was on a cruise around South Georgia island and the Antarctic peninsula on 15-30 January, saw the devastation first-hand, as the ship was repeatedly prevented from docking. Every day they would say we can't land here because there are too many dead animals, said Saunders. The only place the ship could anchor was in Grytviken, home to Shackleton's grave, a British post office and a museum. We weren't allowed to go up to the grave of Ernest Shackleton because there were so many dead seals blocking the way, she said. My impression from what I could see was that there were hundreds of dead seals. Saunders said calculating the number of mortalities was challenging, as it is difficult to distinguish between dead, ill and resting seals, but added: There seemed to be an awful lot of bodies on the beach a lot of seal pups with no mum. They were desperately trying to run around. Shackleton was buried on the island in 1922 after he had a heart attack while exploring the Antarctic continent, and his grave has become a pilgrimage site for enthusiasts. One man on the cruise wanted to read a poem at Shackleton's grave, Saunders said, and another had brought a special whiskey to propose a toast to the explorer. Colette Engstrom, a travel consultant who was on the same cruise, said: There did definitely appear to be a lot of dead seals on South Georgia, in particular around Shackleton's grave. Visibility was poor, she said, but we were being assured that the reason we couldn't go [to the grave] was because all the seals or many of the seals were dead, and bird flu was being blamed. Saunders says many of those on her cruise had not known about bird flu, and were not informed of its impact before the trip. My dream was to walk among the king penguins and I couldn't, said Saunders. But no one wants to contaminate the environment. A spokesperson for Silversea said: The government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands temporarily restricted access to various sites as part of an effort to protect certain species of wildlife within its delicate ecosystem. Our Antarctica, Falklands, and South Georgia cruises will continue sailing as planned, and will call on alternative sites or add additional Zodiac cruising or sea-kayaking opportunities, based on the conditions. The safety of our guests, crew, and the destinations we visit including their wildlife is our top priority. Dr Norman Ratcliffe, a seabird ecologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) who has worked on penguins and seabirds on South Georgia, said these observations of seal deaths were in line with what researchers have seen in the region. There has been widespread mortality along the north coast of South Georgia, he said. On South Georgia, H5N1 has been confirmed in elephant seals, fur seals, Antarctic terns, wandering albatrosses and kelp gulls, according to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (Scar). On the Falkland Islands 500 miles (1,500km) west of South Georgia deaths of gentoo penguins have been confirmed at three separate sites. Other confirmed cases have been reported in birds such as southern fulmar, variable hawk, brown skua and black-brown albatross. While Scar's database does not provide data on the number of seals that have died in the region, H5N1 has caused mass die-offs in marine mammals before: in 2023, scientists estimated the strain had killed off more than 17,000 southern elephant seal pups in Argentina, with the mortality rate in some breeding seasons reaching 96%. With the breeding season drawing to a close on the island, experts hope that the spread be limited. Ratcliffe said: Macaroni penguins will remain vulnerable as they gather in large concentrations to moult but subsequently will disperse to sea where transmission will be low. Gentoo and king penguins, however, continue to form communal roosts or to breed, respectively, throughout the winter and so may remain at risk. Researchers have previously raised the alarm about one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times if bird flu reached remote Antarctic penguin populations. The current outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1 which started in 2021 is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds.

{"id": "384", "title": "Bird-flu threat disrupts Antarctic penguin studies", "date": "2024-03-15", "fulltext": "Projects have been cancelled in an effort to curb the virus' spread. A deadly strain of bird flu circulating worldwide is disrupting research in Antarctica and could lead to the cancellation of some projects to study penguins, seals and other animals next year. This is the first time I remember such reduced access to animal colonies since I started my Antarctic career in 1996, says microbiologist Antonio Quesada del Corral, who manages the Spanish Antarctic research programme and is based in Madrid. Several projects were cancelled this year, because we wanted to reduce the risk of having an infection of people or being the vector that spreads sickness between different animal colonies, he says. We had scheduled for next year more new projects on animal colonies. Some of these are now likely not going to take place. Antarctic seals recruited to measure effects of climate change Researchers first detected avian influenza, caused by the circulating H5N1 subtype of the virus, in the wider Antarctic region in October 2023. They found the virus in dead birds, including skuas and gulls, in the sub-Antarctic territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. This sparked fears among scientists that bird flu would soon reach Antarctica itself. We were very afraid, says Quesada del Corral. As a result, he says, the Spanish Antarctic research programme was revised for the summer season, which runs from around October to late March. Since then, only researchers specializing in infectious diseases and viruses have been allowed access to animal colonies, he adds. In the sub-Antarctic, the virus is known to have spread to elephant and fur seals, albatrosses, terns, gentoo penguins and king penguins, suggesting that these animals are also at risk in Antarctica. Data disruption Researchers involved in about half a dozen projects have been unable to collect data from sensors that are located in animal colonies and gather information year-round, says Quesada del Corral. We had several projects that needed to download information from some sensors [located] in colonies of penguins, sea lions, elephant seals, leopard seals and they were not able to go in there. Some of these long-term projects aim to monitor animal behaviour for example, to determine when penguins hatch, moult and move to or from a rookery. Others aim to track the impacts of the animals on the environment, or to sample bacteria in aerosols produced by the colonies. In theory, data collected by sensors could still be retrievable next year. The memory of the sensors is normally about two years, says Quesada del Corral. We usually change the battery every year. Hopefully next year they will have at least partial data collected. But there is a chance that the batteries will fail, or that restrictions could tighten. I really am afraid that next year the season is going to be worse than this, he adds. The activities of Argentine researchers have also been disrupted by bird flu, says Martí Ansaldo, an ecologist at the Argentine Antarctic Institute in Buenos Aires. We suspended all activities that had direct contact with animals, wherever we observed animals with unusual behaviour or an unusual increase in the number of dead, he says. This affected scientists studying the reproduction, behaviour and physiology of birds and mammals. Research carried out under the US Antarctic Program has not yet been disrupted by bird flu, according to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which funds the programme. Nonetheless, it is possible that any future outbreak detected could impact research, an NSF spokesperson told Nature. Decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis. Tip of the iceberg Researchers' fears were confirmed in February, when H5N1 was detected on the Antarctic mainland for the first time. The virus was found in dead skuas near Argentina's Primavera research station, located on the Antarctic Peninsula, which stretches north towards South America. With this confirmation, we know that the infection can reach any colony in a few days, says Quesada del Corral. Scientists have just started a new expedition to sample for bird flu on the Antarctic Peninsula, says Antonio Alcamí, a virologist based at the Severo Ochoa Centre for Molecular Biology in Madrid, who was among those who first detected H5N1 on the mainland. Monitoring the spread of the virus will help to protect researchers on Antarctica. The confirmation of H5N1 [on the mainland] generated an early warning to take extreme care of the people working in Antarctica, both logistical and scientific, says Ansaldo.

{"id": "385", "title": "Bird flu is decimating seal colonies. Scientists don't know how to stop it", "date": "2024-03-22", "fulltext": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Avian influenza is killing tens of thousands of seals and sea lions in different corners of the world, disrupting ecosystems and flummoxing scientists who don't see a clear way to slow the devastating virus. The worldwide bird flu outbreak that began in 2020 has led to the deaths of millions of domesticated birds and spread to wildlife all over the globe. This virus isn't thought to be a major threat to humans, but its spread in farming operations and wild ecosystems has caused widespread economic turmoil and environmental disruptions. Seals and sea lions, in places as far apart as Maine and Chile, appear to be especially vulnerable to the disease, scientists said. The virus has been detected in seals on the east and west coasts of the U.S., leading to deaths of more than 300 seals in New England and a handful more in Puget Sound in Washington. The situation is even more dire in South America, where more than 20,000 sea lions have died in Chile and Peru and thousands of elephant seals have died in Argentina. The virus can be controlled in domesticated animals, but it can spread unchecked in wildlife and marine mammals such as South America's seals that lacked prior exposure to it have suffered devastating consequences, said Marcela Uhart, director of the Latin America program at the Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center at the University of California, Davis. \"Once the virus is in wildlife, it spreads like wildfire, as long as there are susceptible animals and species,\" Uhart said. \"Movement of animals spreads the virus to new areas.\" Scientists are still researching how the seals have contracted bird flu, but it is most likely from contact with infected seabirds, Uhart said. High mortality has affected South American marine mammals consistently since the virus arrived late in 2022, and birds in Peru and Chile have died by the hundreds of thousands from the virus since then, she noted. The virus is still spreading and was detected in mainland Antarctica for the first time in February. The deaths of seals and sea lions disrupts ecosystems where the marine mammals serve as key predators near the top of the food chain. Seals help keep the ocean in balance by preventing overpopulation of the fish species they feed on. Many species affected, such as South American sea lions and Southern elephant seals, have relatively stable populations, but scientists worry about the possibility of the virus jumping to more jeopardized animals. Scientists have said bird flu might have played a role in the deaths of hundreds of endangered Caspian seals in Russia last year. \"The loss of wildlife at the current scale presents an unprecedented risk of wildlife population collapse, creating an ecological crisis,\" the World Organisation for Animal Health, an intergovernmental organization, said in a statement. In New England, scientists with the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University found an outbreak of bird flu that killed more than 330 harbor and gray seals along the North Atlantic coast in 2022 turned out to be worse than initially thought. It's possible the seals contracted the virus from gulls by coming into contact with sick gulls' excrement or by preying on an infected bird, the scientists reported. The U.S. government determined the seal die-off was an \"unusual mortality event\" attributable to bird flu. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has declared the event is over, but concerns remain about a possible repeat. \"Marine mammals are still pretty unique in the scale of the outbreaks that are occurring,\" said Wendy Puryear, an author of the Tufts study. \"One of the connections is there is a lot of virus that circulates in coastal birds. A lot of opportunities for those wild birds to host the virus and pass it on to marine mammals.\" Some scientists and environmental advocates say there could be a link between the outbreaks and climate change and warming oceans. Warmer sea temperatures off northern Chile decrease the population of forage fish, and that makes sea lions weaker and more susceptible to disease, said Liesbeth van der Meer, director of the environmental group Oceana in Chile. Scientists and environmentalists are hopeful vaccinating poultry will help lessen the spread of the disease, van der Meer said, adding that it's also important for people to avoid potentially infected animals in the wild. \"Authorities have carried out campaigns about the disease, strongly recommending to stay away from seabirds or marine mammals with symptoms or found dead in the coastal areas,\" van der Meer said. Even seals in aquariums are not considered completely safe from bird flu. The New England Aquarium, where outdoor harbor seal exhibits delight thousands of visitors every year, has taken strict sanitation precautions to prevent transmission of the virus to its animals, said Melissa Joblon, the Boston aquarium's director of animal health. Staff aren't allowed to bring backyard poultry products to the aquarium, and an awning protects the seal exhibit from birds that could carry the virus, she said. \"We do know that it's a risk for the animals that reside here,\" said Joblon, adding that none of the aquarium's seals have been infected. The deaths of marine mammals are even more concerning because of mutations of the avian virus, according to a paper in the journal Nature Communications last fall. The mutations \"warrant further examination and highlight an urgent need for active local surveillance to manage outbreaks and limit spillover into other species, including humans,\" the study stated. Another study, published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases in February, found the bird flu virus has adapted to spread between birds and mammals. Researchers found nearly identical samples of the virus in dead sea lions, a dead seal and a dead seabird. They said the finding is significant because it confirms a multispecies outbreak that can affect marine mammals and birds. More seal deaths could disrupt critical ecosystems around the world, said Lynda Doughty, executive director of Marine Mammals of Maine, a marine mammal rescue organization that responded to seals with bird flu during the New England outbreak. \"You need this happy ecosystem. If we're taking out some important species, what is the trickle down effect of that? That's the million dollar question,\" Doughty said. ___ Follow Patrick Whittle on X, formerly Twitter: @pxwhittle Eds: UPDATES: Links audio.

{"id": "386", "title": "Bird Flu Spreads to Dairy Cows", "date": "2024-03-25", "fulltext": "U.S. regulators confirmed that sick cattle in Texas, Kansas and possibly in New Mexico contracted avian influenza. They stressed that the nation's milk supply is safe. A form of avian influenza that is highly fatal in birds has been confirmed in U.S. dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas, the Department of Agriculture announced on Monday. It is the first time that cows infected with the virus have been identified. The cows appear to have been infected by wild birds, and dead birds were reported on some farms, the agency said. The Texas Animal Health Commission confirmed that the influenza subtype known as H5N1 has been identified and said that the virus resembled the version that has been spreading in birds across the nation. The results were announced after multiple federal and state agencies began investigating reports of sick cows in Texas, Kansas and New Mexico. The illness has primarily affected older cows, causing symptoms that include reduced appetite, fever and a sudden drop in milk production. So far, the U.S.D.A. said, there had been few or no reports of deaths in the affected herds. In several cases, the virus was detected in unpasteurized samples of milk collected from sick cows. Pasteurization should inactivate the flu virus, experts said, and officials stressed that the milk supply was safe. At this stage, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, the agency said in a statement. Outside experts agreed. It has only been found in milk that is grossly abnormal, said Dr. Jim Lowe, a veterinarian and influenza researcher at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In those cases, the milk was described as thick and syrupy, he said, and was discarded. The agency said that dairies are required to divert or destroy milk from sick animals. The cattle infections come on the heels of the nation's first detection of highly pathogenic bird flu in goats, which was announced by Minnesota officials last week. So far, the flu samples from sick cows have not contained genetic mutations that are known to make the virus more likely to infect humans, the agriculture agency said, adding that the risk to the general public remained low. There's still no cause to panic, said Stacey L. Schultz-Cherry, a virologist and influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. It just looks like it's another spillover event due to contact with diseased wild birds. Still, she noted, cows were not thought to be among the species that were particularly susceptible to avian influenza, and the cases were another worrisome turn in a global bird flu outbreak that has devastated wild bird populations over the last few years. The outbreak has been caused by a new form of bird flu virus, known as H5N1, that emerged in Europe in 2020. Wild birds can spread the virus, through their feces and oral secretions, to farmed poultry and other animals. Outbreaks often flare up in the spring and summer, when migrating birds are on the move. Although avian influenza viruses are adapted to spread primarily among birds, the new version of H5N1 has become so widespread in wild birds that it has also repeatedly spread to mammals, especially scavenging species, such as foxes, that might feed on infected birds. Infected wild birds could transmit the virus to cows by contaminating their food or water, said Dr. Joe Armstrong, a veterinarian and cattle production expert at the University of Minnesota Extension. You get onto a farm, especially during the migratory season, and you've got geese and ducks looking for feed just like everyone else, he said. To me that's the most likely route. But it is also possible that free-ranging cats, which are not uncommon on farms and are known to be susceptible to the virus, could be involved in spreading the pathogen, he said. Dr. Armstrong also cautioned that it was too soon to conclude that avian influenza was the primary cause of disease in all of the sick cows that have been reported. Infections of mammals, which give bird flu viruses new opportunities to evolve, are always a source of some concern, Andrew Bowman, a molecular epidemiologist and influenza expert at Ohio State University, said. Scientists have long been concerned that a bird flu virus that evolved to spread more efficiently among mammals, including humans, could set off the next pandemic. At this point, Dr. Bowman said, it remains unclear whether the infected cows have all picked up the virus directly from birds or whether the virus is also spreading from cow to cow. That's a question that's going to have to get resolved quickly, he said. If we have transmission cattle to cattle, that's a different story. That certainly makes me a little more nervous. A closer look at the viral genomes should help scientists learn more about how the virus is spreading and whether it is evolving in ways that would increase the public health risk, scientists said. These first cases also mean that flu surveillance in cattle should be ramped up, said Richard Webby, a virologist and influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. It's pretty clear that we have to now get a better feel for how widespread this is in cows, he said. Flu probably wasn't a major part of a diagnostic work-up for a sick cow before this, but it's certainly going to be moving forward.", "media_outlet": "NYTimes", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_3": "At this point, Dr. Bowman said, it remains unclear whether the infected cows have all picked up the virus directly from birds or whether the virus is also spreading from cow to cow.

{"id": "387", "title": "�autious optimism�s penguins test positive for bird flu but show no symptoms", "date": "2024-03-26", "fulltext": "Asymptomatic cases may seem reassuring for the penguins, but scientists fear they could act as 'Trojan horses' for other species. Adélie penguins in Antarctica are testing positive for bird flu without showing outward signs of disease, according to researchers who travelled around 13 remote breeding sites on an ice-breaking cruise ship. Since bird flu arrived in the region this year, there have been concerns about the virus reaching the Antarctic's fragile penguin populations. In November last year, researchers warned in a pre-print research paper that if the virus caused mass mortality in these colonies, 'it could signal one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times.' In December 2023 and January 2024, scientists tested 16 Adélie penguins on Beagle Island in the Antarctic Peninsula for H5N1, and seven (43%) tested positive. Satellite trackers on the penguins showed they were alive and foraging as normal two months later in early March 2024. At another site on Red Rock Ridge, nine Adélie penguins were tested and one tested positive. None showed any sign of disease, which is good news for the penguins, but researchers warn they could act as 'Trojan horses,' facilitating the spread of the virus to vulnerable species. 'These asymptomatic cases may seem reassuring for the species in question, but they have strong implications for Antarctic wildlife in general, potentially leading to unnoticed and widespread virus transmission,' wrote researchers, led by Fabiola León from UC Chile, in the bioRxiv paper, which has yet to be peer-reviewed. Their findings are cause for 'some cautious optimism for penguin populations,' says Colin Butter, an associate professor of bioveterinary sciences at the University of Lincoln, who was not involved in the research. While it is possible some penguin populations could be resistant, this cannot be known for certain, as many other penguin species have died in South America. Bird flu's widespread distribution across Antarctica would also threaten other populations, including seals and whales. 'The Antarctic ecosystem is precious and fragile. Influenza virus could cause devastating disruption from which it will not recover,' Butter said. Ed Hutchinson, a molecular biologist from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, who was also not involved in the paper, said the limited sampling meant this survey only provided a snapshot of what was happening. 'The fact that apparently healthy birds were found to be infected with influenza viruses is really important, but it is not surprising,' he said. 'We know from elsewhere in the world that some types of bird are more likely to become severely ill with this virus than others. As the spread of coronavirus in humans reminded us, the presence of healthy but infectious individuals can be a real problem in controlling the spread of an outbreak. This study highlights the importance of continued monitoring of this.' Dr. Connor Bamford, a virologist from Queen's University Belfast, said he was cautious about the findings. 'More work is needed to study these animals with regard to avian influenza in sickness and in health. High mortalities associated with highly pathogenic H5 have been documented in penguins in the past. However, the reasons why these penguins appear to be protected, and its implications, are hard to say.' The testing between December 2023 and January 2024 was conducted along the east and west coasts of the Antarctic Peninsula and Antarctic western coast. It provides a snapshot of how the virus is spreading in the continent. In total, 115 seemingly healthy birds were sampled, and nine tested positive, including eight Adélie penguins and one Antarctic shag. Researchers tested 31 emperor penguins and none tested positive. It is not possible to say if the virus had reached these colonies and was no longer present, or if these birds had not been exposed to it at all. Bird flu was first confirmed on Antarctica's mainland in February, after a number of cases in the sub-Antarctic islands. The paper's researchers said: 'The first-time detection of suspected cases of H5N1 influenza in penguins and cormorants in the Antarctic continent marks a significant expansion into this isolated continent and puts highly vulnerable bird populations at risk.' The spread of H5N1 has caused millions of wild birds to die globally, with thousands of sea lions and seals also dying from 'spillover' events into wild mammals. After its arrival in the sub-Antarctic in October, there have been mortalities in about 10 species of Antarctic seabirds and seals.", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "'These asymptomatic cases may seem reassuring for the species in question, but they have strong implications for Antarctic wildlife in general, potentially leading to unnoticed and widespread virus transmission,' wrote researchers, led by Fabiola León from UC Chile, in the bioRxiv paper, which has yet to be peer-reviewed.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "'As the spread of coronavirus in humans reminded us, the presence of healthy but infectious individuals can be a real problem in controlling the spread of an outbreak.

{"id": "388", "title": "Dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas test positive for bird flu", "date": "2024-03-26", "fulltext": "Milk from dairy cows in Texas and Kansas has tested positive for bird flu, U.S. officials said Monday. Officials with the Texas Animal Health Commission confirmed the flu virus is the Type A H5N1 strain, known for decades to cause outbreaks in birds and to occasionally infect people. The virus is affecting older dairy cows in those states and in New Mexico, causing decreased lactation and low appetite. It comes a week after officials in Minnesota announced that goats on a farm where there had been an outbreak of bird flu among poultry were diagnosed with the virus. It's believed to be the first time bird flu, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza, was found in U.S. livestock. The commercial milk supply is safe and risk to people is low, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Dairies are required to only allow milk from healthy animals to enter the food supply, and milk from the sick animals is being diverted or destroyed. Pasteurization also kills viruses and other bacteria, and the process is required for milk sold through interstate commerce, the agency said. At this stage, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, the USDA said in a statement. The federal government said its tests in the cattle did not detect any changes to the virus that would make it spread more easily to people. Dairy farmers in Texas first became concerned three weeks ago when cattle started falling ill with what officials called 'mystery dairy cow disease,' Texas Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said. Milk production fell sharply and the cows were lethargic and weren't eating much. 'We hadn't seen anything like it before,' he said. 'It was kind of like they had a cold.' The state's animal health commission began an investigation that included tests for bird flu, spokeswoman Erin Robinson said. Based on findings from Texas, USDA officials think the cows got the virus from infected wild birds. Experts say livestock appear to recover on their own within seven to 10 days. That's different than bird flu outbreaks in poultry, which necessitate killing flocks to get rid of the virus. Since 2022, outbreaks have affected about 82 million wild and commercial birds in the U.S. So far, the virus appears to be infecting about 10% of lactating dairy cows in the affected herds, said Michael Payne, a food animal veterinarian and biosecurity expert with the University of California-Davis Western Institute for Food Safety and Security. 'This doesn't look anything like the high-path influenza in bird flocks,' he said. Bird flu was detected in unpasteurized, clinical samples of milk from sick cattle collected from two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas. The virus was also found in a nose and throat swab from another dairy in Texas. Officials called it a rapidly evolving situation. The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are involved, along with officials in the three states. Another dairy-heavy state, Iowa, said it is monitoring the situation. Dairy industry officials said that producers have started enhanced biosecurity efforts on U.S. farms, including limiting the amount of traffic into and out of properties and restricting visits to employees and essential personnel. Bird flu previously has been reported in 48 different mammal species, Payne noted, adding: 'It was probably only a matter of time before avian influenza made its way to ruminants.' ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

As of Monday, the highly contagious pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) had been found in unpasteurized clinical samples of milk from ill cows at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, plus a swab from a dairy cow in Texas, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced in a news release. The agency said its officials, along with the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state veterinary and public health authorities, were investigating an illness detected primarily in older dairy cows in those states, as well as in New Mexico. Wild migratory birds are believed to be the source of the infection, the USDA wrote, and viral testing and epidemiologic efforts are continuing this week. Are manatees endangered? Here's the current conservation status of the marine mammal. Farms in Texas, Kansas report finding dead birds on properties Additional testing took place Friday and over the weekend, the USDA reported, because farms have also reported finding dead wild birds on their properties. Based on findings from Texas, the agency wrote in the release, the detections appear to have been introduced by wild birds, and the commercial milk supply remains safe due to both federal animal health requirements and pasteurization. Bird flu spread to humans is low risk, USDA says Initial testing by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories has not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans, the USDA said, which means the risk to the public contracting the virus remains low for now. Federal and state agencies said they are moving quickly to conduct additional bird flu testing. The first detection of HPAI in dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas underscores the importance of adherence to biosecurity measures, vigilance in monitoring for disease, and immediately involving your veterinarian when something seems off, American Veterinary Medical Association president Dr. Rena Carlson said. A complete evaluation, including the collection and submission of laboratory samples and reporting to state animal health officials when appropriate, and in a timely fashion, are incredibly important. Bird flu in Texas, Kansas affecting older dairy cows The Texas Animal Health Commission confirmed the flu virus is the Type A H5N1 strain, known for decades to cause outbreaks in birds and to occasionally infect people. The virus, the state agency said, is affecting older dairy cows in Texas and Kansas, as well as cattle in in New Mexico, causing symptoms including decreased lactation and low appetite. Breaking: Baltimore's Key Bridge collapses after ship collision; 2 rescued, search continues: Live updates What is bird flu? Bird flu is a disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted among birds. Avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and USDA, are classified into two groups: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) (often seen in wild birds) and HPAI, found mostly in domestic poultry. According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, and HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds. Bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds were slaughtered last year to limit the spread of the virus. What are signs of bird flu? Symptoms of bird flu include: * Loss of appetite, lethargy. * Death without prior symptoms. * Eyelid swelling. * Twisting of the head and neck. * Purple discoloration to body parts, including legs. No concern about commercial milk supply safety At this stage, the USDA wrote, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health. Dairies are required to send milk from healthy animals into processing before it can be put on grocery shelves, the agency said, and the milk from the sick animals was being destroyed. In addition, USDA officials said, pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, including influenza, in milk. It's also required for milk entering interstate commerce. For the dairies whose herds are exhibiting symptoms, on average about ten percent of each affected herd appears to be impacted, with little to no associated mortality reported among the animals, the USDA wrote in its release. Milk loss resulting from symptomatic cattle to date is too limited to have a major impact on supply and there should be no impact on the price of milk or other dairy products.

{"id": "390", "title": "Bird flu detected in milk from dairy cows in Texas and Kansas", "date": "2024-03-26", "fulltext": "Milk and nasal swab samples from sick cattle on at least two dairy farms in Texas and two in Kansas have tested positive for bird flu, according to federal and state officials. Agencies are moving quickly to conduct more testing for the illness known as highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a news release Monday. Cattle are showing flu-like symptoms and lactating discolored milk, Texas state officials said. Wild migratory birds are probably the source of infection, federal officials added, pointing to reports that farms have found dead wild birds on their properties. The announcement comes after Minnesota officials reported the first infection of avian flu among livestock in the United States last week, when a juvenile goat living on a farm with infected poultry tested positive. The infections among cattle pose minimal risk to human food safety or milk supply and prices, officials said. Milk from sick cattle is being diverted or destroyed. Pasteurization, a heating treatment that kills pathogens, is required for milk involved in interstate commerce, greatly reducing the possibility that infected milk enters the food supply, they added. The milk samples that tested positive for bird flu were unpasteurized, according to federal officials. \"There is no threat to the public and there will be no supply shortages,\" Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a news release. \"No contaminated milk is known to have entered the food chain; it has all been dumped. In the rare event that some affected milk enters the food chain, the pasteurization process will kill the virus.\" Officials have long cautioned consumers to avoid raw milk, or unpasteurized milk, which can be sold within some states, including Texas and Kansas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls raw milk \"one of the riskiest foods\" and says it is \"linked to a variety of foodborne illnesses.\" Texas requires dairy farms selling raw milk to have it tested every three months. Kansas requires raw milk sales to \"take place at the farm where it was produced,\" while any advertising and any containers must plainly state that it is raw milk. The loss of milk from symptomatic cows is too limited to have a major impact on milk supply, federal officials said, meaning \"there should be no impact on the price of milk or other dairy products.\" Federal and state officials are investigating primarily older cows in Texas, Kansas and New Mexico. Iowa officials are also \"actively monitoring this evolving situation.\" Unlike outbreaks among poultry, bird flu infections among mammals are expected not to require massive culling efforts, officials said. In rare cases, avian flu has jumped from birds to humans, most notably during an avian influenza outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997, according to the World Health Organization. Brian Hoefs, a veterinarian and the executive director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, said last week that the kid goat's bird flu infection \"highlights the possibility of the virus infecting other animals on farms with multiple species.\" \"Thankfully, research to-date has shown mammals appear to be dead-end hosts, which means they're unlikely to spread HPAI further,\" he added at the time. Miller said he does not expect a \"need to depopulate dairy herds,\" and that the affected cattle are \"expected to fully recover.\"", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "In rare cases, avian flu has jumped from birds to humans, most notably during an avian influenza outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997, according to the World Health Organization.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Brian Hoefs, a veterinarian and the executive director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, said last week that the kid goat's bird flu infection 'highlights the possibility of the virus infecting other animals on farms with multiple species.'", "affirm_why_count": 2, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "Thankfully, research to-date has shown mammals appear to be dead-end hosts, which means they're unlikely to spread HPAI further,", "deny_transmissible_statement_2": "The infections among cattle pose minimal risk to human food safety or milk supply and prices, officials said.", "deny_transmissible_statement_3": "There is no threat to the public and there will be no supply shortages,", "deny_transmissible_statement_4": "No contaminated milk is known to have entered the food chain; it has all been dumped.

{"id": "391", "title": "Northumberland� Farne Islands reopen to visitors after bird flu outbreak", "date": "2024-03-27", "fulltext": "Boats had been barred from landing since July 2022 owing to virus, which has ravaged populations of seabirds The puffins started arriving two weeks ago and now there are thousands of them fizzing around in a mad frenzy. They have joined kittiwakes, guillemots, razorbills, fulmars and shags. Soon Arctic terns will arrive after their epic journey across the world from the Antarctic. This week humans arrived after a two-year ban from the Farne Islands in Northumberland, one of the UK's most important sanctuaries for breeding seabirds. Boat visitors have been stopped from landing since July 2022 because of bird flu, which has ravaged populations. Since then a more familiar sight has been National Trust rangers in hazmat suits carrying out the grim task of picking up thousands of dead birds and transporting them off the islands to be incinerated. But a corner has been turned in the bird flu outbreak, it is hoped, leading to the decision to allow visitors back on the main island, Inner Farne, this week. First to step off the boat was Paul Watson, originally from the north-east of England but for the last 20 years a police officer in Bermuda, which he agreed had considerably different birds and different weather to north Northumberland. 'It's been a long time it's so bleak,' he said as he walked up from the jetty on a grey, bitterly cold morning. Watson meant bleak in a good way. 'It is beautiful here and it's just so nice to see so many puffins, there must be thousands of them. And no Arctic terns yet. It's actually nice to come early and not have your head pecked to death,' he said. The Arctic terns are known for dive bombing humans, trying to warn them away, which means visitors are urged to wear hats. Watson was visiting with his sister Debbie Breslin, from Morpeth: 'It's great here. So much better than anything you can see on the television.' Sophia Jackson, the trust's area ranger, said it was wonderful to have human visitors back. 'There are so many positive emotions going on today,' she said. 'We are really excited to have people back on the island. The whole team are feeling really positive right now.' Human visitors were part of the ecosystem, she said. 'Having visitors does deter some of the larger predatory birds from coming in so they do serve a purpose. Watching the public today and seeing their faces, knowing memories are being created it's brilliant.' It has been a challenging time for rangers looking after a place that is an internationally important home for about 200,000 seabirds. Ian Clemmett, the trust's countryside manager for the area, said: 'Picking up thousands of dead birds has been incredibly upsetting for people. Sadly it has become part of our recruitment process because we get seasonal staff, we have to make absolutely sure, 'Are you ready to do this?' They have to be prepared for it.' The bird flu outbreak has been devastating. In 2022, rangers collected more than 6,000 dead birds. Last year, 3,647 were collected, a reduction that raised hopes that herd immunity was building in the colony. The trust said it would closely monitor the situation and return to sail-around-only tours if an outbreak occurred. The return of human visitors meant it could also take the shutters off St Cuthbert's chapel, which has a most spectacular 19th-century stained glass window. Cuthbert, northern England's most important saint, was a seventh-century hermit on Inner Farne and, in lieu of finding his cell, the chapel is a visual reminder of him and his life. 'It's a beauty isn't it?' said Nick Lewis, a trust collections and house officer. 'The window changes what is an otherwise quite a dank, dark building, into a church. You can see the saints [Cuthbert, Aidan and Ethelbert] looking back at you.' Another person on the first boat on Tuesday was Anne Wilson, 80, who was a regular visitor but feared she may never set foot on the island again. 'I've missed it a lot,' said the retired chemist. 'It is so much better, such a different experience when you can land. Coming here is everything. You've got everything you could want here. You've got the birds and you've also got the human history of the islands.' As Wilson speaks there are puffins everywhere, flapping furiously and inelegantly. They are the standup comedians of the bird world and often the biggest draw, yet for Wilson 'Puffins are OK but they're not Arctic terns. Don't get me started on Arctic terns they've got everything.'", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "The trust said it would closely monitor the situation and return to sail-around-only tours if an outbreak occurred.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The bird flu outbreak has been devastating.

{"id": "393", "title": "Easter tradition still egg-spensive with lower prices; Costs seesaw with avian flu outbreaks", "date": "2024-03-28", "fulltext": "Most Americans wait until the Holy Week to shop for Easter, but no matter how long you wait this year, eggs aren't likely to go on sale for much less than they are now. A dozen eggs are around $3 per dozen, on average, according to Federal Reserve data. That's down from January 2023's record $4.82, but still more than double the $1.45 average cost before the pandemic in February 2020. Even if prices aren't as eye-popping as they were last year, they might still be expensive enough to dissuade some people from dyeing a lot of eggs. Others may continue to roll with tradition, though People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is suggesting that the White House tweaks its annual Easter Egg Roll on Sunday and use potatoes instead of eggs. 'Potatoes are cheaper and healthier than eggs and leave birds in peace,' the nonprofit said in a recent news release. Reaction to high egg prices Of the more than 500 consumers polled by research firm Numerator, 65% said they'll buy eggs to decorate and 21% said they plan to buy more than last year. However, 35% said they don't plan to buy eggs to decorate and 11% will buy fewer this year. Of those buying fewer eggs or none, 25% cited high prices as the deterrent. Whether people will see egg prices as a relief or a hindrance to Easter celebrations depends on what you compare them with. Numerator's survey showed 67% of respondents said price was the main consideration when buying eggs for dyeing or decorating, and whether you see the cost as reasonable or too high 'depends upon when and where one establishes the benchmark,' said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consulting firm RSM US. 'If it is four years ago, then the evaluation will tend to be not so good.' Or it can be relative to how other items at the grocery store are priced. 'Eggs are still cheaper than meat,' said Christa Howard Roeh, a mom of three, in Chicago. Even at $5 per dozen, you can eat two large eggs for dinner for about 85 cents, and they provide protein, omega-3, vitamins and other valuable nutrients, said Brian Moscogiuri, a global trade strategist at Eggs Unlimited, an egg supplier. That's a bargain compared with the avocado his wife bought on sale for 75 cents, which she thought was inexpensive, he noted. Or even chocolate eggs, which are seeing a price spike this year due to sharply higher cocoa prices. One classic Cadbury creme egg costs more than $1. 'People just aren't breaking it down to show where the value (of an egg) is,' Moscogiuri said. Why are eggs so expensive? Egg prices soared to about $4.82 per dozen in January 2023 after an avian flu outbreak. Prices started to fall after avian flu subsided. Eggs dropped to about $3.27 a dozen by last Easter and got as low as $2.04 in August. However, another outbreak last November sent prices higher again. Prices have risen over the past six months, with the average cost of a dozen eggs hitting $3 in February. How did people react last year? In April 2023, a dozen eggs were $3.27, a record-high Easter price. This was a 27% increase from the year-ago period, according to Datasembly, which tracks grocery pricing data in real time. Egg sales weakened during the two weeks before the holiday compared with the prior year. During those two weeks in 2023, egg sales only rose 20.5% above the 52-week average, retail data from retail data science company 84.51 showed. In 2022, egg sales spiked 35%.

{"id": "394", "title": "Bird flu spreads to dairy cows in Idaho, Michigan and New Mexico", "date": "2024-03-30", "fulltext": "A highly virulent bird flu first detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas this week has spread to additional herds, bringing the number of affected states to five and adding evidence the virus may be spreading cow-to-cow. The strain has been confirmed in Michigan, and presumptive positive tests have been reported from Idaho and New Mexico, federal officials said Friday. Earlier in the day, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported incorrectly that presumptive positive tests had also been found in Ohio. The presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as HPAI, has been confirmed in a Michigan dairy herd that recently received cows from Texas, according to a statement Friday from the USDA. The virus strain found in Michigan is similar to a strain confirmed in Texas and Kansas that appears to have been introduced by wild birds, the USDA statement said. \"Spread of symptoms among the Michigan herd also indicates that HPAI transmission between cattle cannot be ruled out,\" according to the USDA statement. Initial testing has not identified changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans, according to the USDA. \"While cases among humans in direct contact with infected animals are possible, this indicates that the current risk to the public remains low,\" the agency statement said. Idaho officials announced Thursday that avian flu was detected at a dairy cattle farm in Cassia County after the facility recently imported livestock from another state that had identified HPAI in cows. It did not provide details. But in an interview, state veterinarian Scott Leibsle said avian flu was detected in the Idaho cattle after the farm imported cows from a Texas herd that had shown symptoms of HPAI. \"Cow-to-cow transmission is definitely playing a role in how this disease progresses. To what extent, we don't know yet,\" Leibsle said. It's clear that infected wild birds spread the disease to herds in Texas and Kansas, he said. \"But the herd of cattle that came up from Texas to Idaho, the birds didn't follow,\" the state veterinarian said. Federal officials are monitoring closely and have advised veterinarians and producers to practice good biosecurity, test animals if they have to be moved, minimize animal movements and isolate sick cattle from the herd. The USDA, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating the illness among dairy cows, which is causing decreased milk production, low appetite and other symptoms. Federal officials are also working with state and local public health officials to monitor for signs of diseases among people at the facilities where bird flu was detected. Most infected animals have recovered after isolation, and few cattle deaths have been reported, the USDA said. Idaho's Leibsle said \"not all dairy producers will want to wait one, two, three weeks\" for dairy cows to recover. Some producers may decide to send the animals to slaughter as beef animals, he said. All those cattle will undergo the same rigorous food safety protocols. The USDA statement said there continues to be \"no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply because products are pasteurized before entering the market, or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health.\" Dairies are required to send milk only from healthy animals into processing for human consumption. Milk from infected animals is being diverted or destroyed so that it does not enter the human food supply, USDA said. In addition, pasteurization, which is required for milk entering interstate commerce for human consumption, inactivates bacteria and viruses, including influenza, in milk. Officials have long cautioned consumers to avoid raw or unpasteurized milk. FDA's long-standing position is that unpasteurized milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms posing serious health risks to consumers. Because of the limited information available about the transmission of HPAI in raw milk, the FDA recommends that the dairy industry not manufacture or sell raw milk or unpasteurized cheese products made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those infected with avian influenza or herds exposed to cows infected with the virus.", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "Spread of symptoms among the Michigan herd also indicates that HPAI transmission between cattle cannot be ruled out,", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "Cow-to-cow transmission is definitely playing a role in how this disease progresses.

The case marks the second known instance that a person in the U.S. has been infected with H5N1 bird flu. The person reported eye redness, or conjunctivitis, as their only symptom and is being treated with an antiviral drug. The human health risk of the bird flu remains low for the U.S. general public, the CDC said, but people with close, prolonged exposures to infected animals or their environments are at higher risk. \"At this point, there's nothing that suggests that there is any serious risk of a larger human outbreak,\" said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"I'm trying to understand why the cows are getting infected. That's a really important scientific question right now.\" The previous human case was reported in Colorado in 2022, in a person with direct contact with poultry. Human infections are rare, but the agency said it has been monitoring for infections among people exposed to infected birds after reported outbreaks in U.S. poultry and wild birds began in late 2021. Human illnesses with the virus typically have occurred through exposure to infected poultry or wild birds. Sick birds can shed the virus in their saliva, mucus and feces, and humans can become infected when enough virus gets into their eyes, nose or mouth. Infections have also been reported in other animals including foxes, bears, seals, minks, cats and dogs. The disease in humans ranges from mild infections, which include upper-respiratory and eye-related symptoms, to severe pneumonia. Since 1997, some 890 human cases have been reported across the globe, with a case-fatality rate of roughly 50%, the CDC said. \"It's still a very uncommon illness in humans,\" Inglesby said. \"It is a very serious infection, but it's possible there are cases that are occurring that we're not detecting that are much milder.\" The U.S. Agriculture Department reported the avian influenza in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas in late March this year. Unpasteurized milk from sick cattle at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, as well as a throat swab from a cow in Texas, tested positive for the same strain of the virus that is currently widespread among birds. A few days later, the virus was also confirmed among a Michigan dairy herd that had recently added cows from Texas. This is the first time the H5N1 influenza virus has been detected in cattle in the U.S., according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. There was little or no mortality among affected dairy herds, Agriculture Department officials said. Bird flu has historically been a problem for the poultry industry in the U.S. The current outbreak is the deadliest on record for the U.S. agricultural industry, and has led to the death of tens of millions of chickens, turkeys and other birds since early 2022. Industry officials have attributed the disease's rapid spread to wild birds carrying it to farms during the birds' migration. The disease is usually fatal in chickens that contract it, the CDC has said, and is contagious enough that wild-bird droppings blown on the wind near barn vents can trigger an outbreak. To curb further spread, poultry farms often destroy entire flocks after a single case is detected. People should avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals as well as raw milk, feces or other contaminated materials, the CDC said. People also shouldn't prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food, including raw milk, from animals with a confirmed or suspected infection, the agency said. \"For the vast majority of people, this isn't going to affect them,\" said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health. \"Who it will affect are people who have close contact with animals or economic interest in animals.\" There are no concerns with the safety of the commercial milk supply right now because products on store shelves are pasteurized, according to the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration. Dairies must send milk from only healthy animals to processing, and milk must be pasteurized for it to enter interstate commerce for human consumption. Milk from infected animals is being diverted or destroyed, the CDC said. Jacob Bunge contributed to this article.

{"id": "398", "title": "Person is diagnosed with bird flu after being in contact with cows in Texas", "date": "2024-04-01", "fulltext": "ATLANTA (AP) — A person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu, an infection tied to the recent discovery of the virus in dairy cows, health officials said Monday. The patient was being treated with an antiviral drug and their only reported symptom was eye redness, Texas health officials said. Health officials say the person had been in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and the risk to the public remains low. It marks the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal, federal health officials said. However, there's no evidence of person-to-person spread or that anyone has become infected from milk or meat from livestock, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Genetic tests don't suggest that the virus suddenly is spreading more easily or that it is causing more severe illness, Shah said. And current antiviral medications still seem to work, he added. Last week, dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with bird flu and federal agriculture officials later confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from Texas. None of the hundreds of affected cows have died, Shah said. Since 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises in scores of countries. However, the detection in U.S. livestock is an unexpected and problematic twist, said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska's public health college. This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. More than 460 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of infected people got it directly from birds, but scientists have been on guard for any sign of spread among people. Texas officials didn't identify the newly infected person, nor release any details about what brought them in contact with the cows. The CDC does not recommend testing for people who have no symptoms. Roughly a dozen people in Texas who did have symptoms were tested in connection with the dairy cow infections, but only the one person came back positive, Shah said. It's only the second time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

{"id": "399", "title": "What to Know About the Bird Flu Outbreak in Dairy Cows", "date": "2024-04-01", "fulltext": "The infections, which include one associated human case, add another worrying wrinkle to a global outbreak that has devastated bird and marine mammal populations. An unusual bird flu outbreak in dairy cows has now affected at least 13 herds in six states, according to federal and state officials. These infections represent the first time that a highly pathogenic bird flu virus, which is often fatal in birds, has been detected in U.S. cattle. At least one person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu after having contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected, state officials said on Monday. The patient's primary symptom was conjunctivitis; the individual is being treated with an antiviral drug and is recovering, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus has been identified as the same version of H5N1, an influenza subtype, that is circulating in North American birds. Scientists have not found evidence that the virus has acquired the mutations it would need to spread easily between humans, officials have said. The risk to the general public remains low, experts said. But these developments add a worrying dimension to an avian influenza outbreak that has already affected millions of birds and sea mammals worldwide. Here's what to know: What is bird flu? Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a group of flu viruses that are primarily adapted to birds. The particular virus in these new cases, called H5N1, was first identified in 1996 in geese in China, and in people in Hong Kong in 1997. In 2020, a new, highly pathogenic form of H5N1 emerged in Europe and spread quickly around the world. In the United States, it has affected more than 82 million farmed birds, the worst bird flu outbreak in U.S. history. Since the virus was first identified, sporadic cases have been found in people in other countries. But a vast majority resulted from prolonged, direct contact with birds. H5N1 does not yet seem to have adapted to spread efficiently among people, experts say. How did cows get bird flu? Cows were not thought to be a species at high risk. 'The fact that they are susceptible — the virus can replicate, can make them sick — that is something I wouldn't have predicted,' said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. But this year, reports of sick cows began to emerge in Texas and New Mexico. Dead birds were also found on some of these farms, and laboratory testing confirmed that some cows were infected with bird flu. (In Texas, three symptomatic cats also tested positive for the virus, the Texas Animal Health Commission said in an email. Feline infections are not new; cats are known to be susceptible to the virus, which they can pick up when they hunt or eat infected birds.) It is not entirely clear how the virus found its way into cattle. But one likely route, several experts said, is that infected wild birds, which shed the virus in their feces, saliva and other secretions, contaminated the cows' food or water. How have cows been affected? Although the virus is often fatal in birds, it appears to be causing relatively mild illness in cows. 'It's not killing animals, and they seem to be recovering,' said Dr. Joe Armstrong, a veterinarian and cattle production expert at the University of Minnesota Extension. Last week, the U.S.D.A. said that there were no plans to 'depopulate,' or kill, affected herds, which is the standard procedure when poultry flocks are infected with the virus. The disease is primarily affecting older cows, which have developed symptoms that include a loss of appetite, a low-grade fever and a significant drop in milk production. The milk that the cows do produce is often 'thick and discolored,' according to Texas officials. The virus has also been found in unpasteurized milk samples collected from sick cows. It is not yet clear whether the bird flu virus is the sole cause of all the symptoms and illnesses that have been reported, experts cautioned. How widespread is the problem? It's unclear. On Tuesday, the U.S.D.A. said that its National Veterinary Services Laboratories had confirmed bird flu infections in 12 herds to date: seven in Texas, two in Kansas and one each in Michigan, New Mexico and Idaho. On Wednesday, Ohio's Department of Agriculture announced that it had also received confirmation of an affected herd from the national laboratories. So far, the virus has been found only in dairy cows and not in beef cattle. But because cows are not routinely tested for bird flu, and the illness has been relatively mild, there could be other infected herds that have escaped detection, experts said. And the movement of cattle between states could transport the virus to new locations. The affected dairy in Michigan had recently imported cows from an infected herd in Texas. When the cows were transported, the animals were not displaying any symptoms. The farm in Idaho had also recently imported cows from an affected state, Idaho officials said. How is it spreading? That is a key, and still unanswered, question. It is possible that the infected cows are picking up the virus independently, especially if shared food or water sources have been contaminated. A more worrisome possibility, however, is that the virus is spreading from cow to cow. On Friday, the U.S.D.A. noted that 'transmission between cattle cannot be ruled out.' Several scientists said that they would be surprised if there were not some degree of cow-to-cow transmission. 'How else could it move so rapidly?' said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. If the virus can spread easily between cows, that could lead to larger, more sustained outbreaks. It would also give the virus more opportunities to adapt to its new mammalian hosts, increasing the risk that it acquires mutations that make it more dangerous to people. What do we know about the human case? This is only the second case of H5N1 bird flu in people in the United States; the first was in 2022. The patient worked directly with sick dairy cows, said Lara M. Anton, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. 'We have tested around a dozen symptomatic people who work at dairies, and only the one person has tested positive for the virus,' she said in an email on Monday. A sample of virus from the patient displayed one mutation that allows it to infect people more easily. But to be capable of spreading from one person to another, the virus must acquire several additional mutations — not an easy evolutionary feat. The C.D.C. is working with state health departments to monitor other people who may have been in contact with infected birds and animals, the agency said on Monday. It also urged people to avoid exposure to sick or dead birds and animals, and to raw milk, feces or other potentially contaminated materials. How will officials know if bird flu adapts to spread between people? Analyzing the genetic sequence of the virus from infected birds, cows and people can reveal whether H5N1 has acquired mutations that help it spread among people. Scientists have been closely tracking infections in birds and sea mammals and, now, cows. So far, the virus does not seem to have the ability to spread efficiently between people. In 2012, scientists showed that H5N1 was able to spread through air between ferrets — a popular model for studying transmission of respiratory viruses among people — after acquiring five mutations. A sample of bird flu isolated from a Chilean man last year had two mutations that indicate adaptation to infecting mammals. But those mutations have previously been seen without the virus evolving further to spread between people, experts said. Is it safe to consume dairy products? Federal officials have stressed that commercially processed milk remains safe to drink. Dairies are required to keep milk from sick animals out of the human food supply, and milk sold across state lines must be pasteurized, a process in which the milk is heated to kill potential pathogens. Pasteurization 'has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk,' the Food and Drug Administration said in a new online guide to milk safety. Dr. Gail Hansen, a veterinary public health expert and independent consultant, agreed that the risk was probably 'very low.' She added, 'I would not want people to stop drinking milk because of it.' But the possibility could not be entirely ruled out, she said, expressing some concern that federal officials had been 'overconfident in the face of so many unknowns.' If cows are shedding virus into their milk before they show signs of illness, that milk could potentially find its way into the commercial supply, she said. And different pathogens may require different pasteurization temperatures and durations; the specific conditions required to inactivate this particular virus remained unclear, Dr. Hansen said. The risk of being infected by the virus by consuming unpasteurized, or raw, dairy products is unknown, the F.D.A. said. Raw milk is known to pose a variety of potential disease risks beyond avian influenza. Could my cat or dog get bird flu? Both cats and dogs can be infected and sickened by avian influenza viruses. It's not clear how common these infections are — many likely escape detection — but reported cases remain relatively rare, especially in dogs. Still, the more widespread the virus becomes in birds, the more risk there is to pets, which can pick up the virus from contact with or consuming sick or dead birds. Virus-laden bird droppings and contaminated water can also pose risks. Experts recommend that pet owners keep their animals away from wild birds, which might mean keeping cats indoors or dogs on a leash. 'If you see a wild bird, don't go pick it up,' said Stacey L. Schultz-Cherry, a virologist and influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

The patient, who has not been publicly identified, suffered from eye inflammation and was tested for the bird flu last week, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirming the infection over the weekend. Texas officials noted that the patient had been directly exposed to dairy cows presumed to be infected and insisted that the virus does not pose much risk to the general public. The bird flu has recently been discovered in cows. The US Department of Agriculture also confirmed that there are no changes in the bird flu virus, Type A H5N1, that would make it more transmissible to humans. 'While cases among humans in direct contact with infected animals are possible, this indicates that the current risk to the public remains low,' the department said in a statement over the weekend. The latest infection comes just a week after dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with the virus. Since then, herds in Michigan, Idaho and New Mexico have also tested positive for bird flu. It's the first time the disease has been found in dairy cattle, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. The virus has thrived more in mammals in recent years, the association added. Health officials say the risks of bird flu to the public remain low.

The prisoner's only symptom was fatigue, which he recovered from. The bird flu was first flagged as a threat to humans in 1997 during an outbreak in Hong Kong, which saw 18 people infected, six of whom died, according to the National Institutes of Health.

The case was confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the weekend, the department said. The CDC said the person who has the H5N1 virus is recovering and was told to isolate. Their only symptom was eye inflammation, and they are being treated with oseltamivir, the Texas health department said. Oseltamivir is the generic version of the antiviral medication Tamiflu. The department is working with local, state and federal health partners to investigate the case and has issued an alert asking health care providers to monitor for any additional cases of avian influenza. 'The case does not change the risk for the general public, which remains low,' the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement. The CDC also said Monday that the risk is low but said it is monitoring the situation. 'Because influenza viruses constantly change, continued surveillance and preparedness efforts are critical, and CDC is taking measures in case the public health risk assessment changes. This is a developing situation, and CDC will share additional updates as new relevant information becomes available,' the agency said in a news release. According to the Texas health agency, the CDC said this is the first case of H5N1 flu in a person linked to dairy cattle and the second case in a person in the US. A Colorado man who had direct exposure to poultry and the culling of birds had bird flu in 2022. There is no risk to the commercial milk supply, the Department of State Health Services said. 'Dairies are required to destroy or divert milk from any sick cows, plus pasteurization kills avian flu viruses,' it said in the statement. Avian flu is a type A influenza virus that originated in birds and has been detected in more than a hundred species like seagulls, owls and ducks in the US since 2022. Many mammals in the US, mostly in the West and Midwest, have been infected with the virus in this latest outbreak. Cases have also been reported among bears, foxes, possums and seals. Scientists say those animals probably got sick when they ate or interacted with infected birds. The virus can spread through feces and saliva and through contact with contaminated surfaces.

Texas health officials reported Monday that an individual who had been in contact with cattle has contracted H5N1 avian flu, only the second case ever recorded in the U.S. The person had contact with dairy cattle that are believed to have been infected with the virus, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement. It went on to say that the individual's only symptom is eye inflammation infection of the conjunctiva, the tissue surrounding the eye. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the infected individual is doing well and is being treated with the influenza antiviral oseltamivir, sold as Tamiflu. The individual was instructed to isolate to reduce the risk of infecting others, and to date there's no indication of onward spread, Shah said.

The virus doesn't kill the cattle, but milk production is lowered and the animals' feeding is reduced. Owners of implicated herds have been told to destroy milk produced by infected cattle, though if milk from infected animals made its way into the food chain, pasteurization could kill the virus, the CDC statement said. Up until now, cows have not been on the ever-lengthening list of animals that have been known to be susceptible to this virus. Infections of the highly pathogenic bird flu a term that describes how it behaves in poultry have been detected in many other mammals, though, including big cats, bears, foxes, skunks, sea lions, and seals. Despite the alarming increase in the past few years of the virus's geographic range and the number of species it has been seen to infect, both the World Health Organization and the CDC currently assess its risk to people as low. The news of the case in Texas does not change that, Shah said. Trending Now: This AI company scans penis pictures for STIs. Its unproven tech is in an FDA gray zone H5N1 bird flu has been high on the worry list of experts on emerging diseases for the past two decades. Over that time there have been nearly 900 human infections in 23 countries; just over half of those infections have been fatal. But in recent years the strain of the virus circulating in many parts of the world including the United States seems to trigger human infections less frequently than earlier versions of the virus did. And when human cases caused by this strain occur, they are typically mild. A case in point was the country's first H5 infection, which occurred in 2022. A man who was involved in culling infected poultry in Colorado reported feeling fatigued; he tested positive for the virus. It was unclear if he was actually even infected or simply had viruses in his nose that were picked up by a nasal swab test. The low rate of human infections and the mildness of most cases when they occur has counterbalanced concern about the virus's astonishing spread. But people who have studied influenza and this virus in particular for years do not know what to make of its movement into so many different animal species. Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., called the infections in cows \"a head scratcher,\" saying he would not have figured cattle to be on the list of animals susceptible to this virus. \"This particular version of H5 is teaching us a number of things we thought we knew weren't right,\" Webby said. He termed the news of the Texas case \"not unexpected, but always a concern.\" Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, said the move into cows expands the virus' range, \"but I'm not sure what it portends for humans and swine.\" Osterholm said he would be more concerned if there were word that the virus had been found to be infecting pigs. Pigs can be infected with human and avian flu viruses and co-infection of more than one type of virus in pigs can produce reassortants hybrid viruses that might be more able to infect people. As of now, he believes the risk H5N1 poses is not changed by the infection of cattle. \"This all could change in a heartbeat with additional mutations.

{"id": "404", "title": "Human case of bird flu detected in Texas after outbreak of virus among cattle", "date": "2024-04-01", "fulltext": "Less than a week after sick dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas tested positive for bird flu, Texas state officials reported that a person in the state has been infected with the virus after coming into close contact with the infected cows. The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a news alert Monday that the patient became 'ill following contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected with avian influenza' and that their primary symptom was conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye. Officials said it is the first human case of the highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in Texas and the second in the U.S. They said it is 'believed to be associated with the recent detections of avian influenza A(H5N1) in dairy cows.' Bird flu risk to general public Federal and state health authorities are investigating the outbreak, the news alert said. It added that the risk to general public is low. 'Avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have only rarely been transmitted from person to person,' authorities said. 'As such, the risk to the general public is believed to be low; however, people with close contact with affected animals suspected of having avian influenza A(H5N1) have a higher risk of infection.' The state department of health, however, has warned health care providers to be vigilant about the sign and symptoms of bird flu, especially among people who have regular contact with animals. Bird flu in dairy cattle in Kansas, Texas The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that the highly contagious pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) had been found in unpasteurized clinical samples of milk from ill cows at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, plus a swab from a dairy cow in Texas. The agency said its officials, along with the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state veterinary and public health authorities, were investigating an illness detected primarily in older dairy cows in those states, as well as in New Mexico. Wild migratory birds are believed to be the source of the infection, the USDA had said. What is bird flu? Bird flu is a disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted among birds. Avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and the USDA, are classified into two groups: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI, often seen in wild birds) and HPAI, found mostly in domestic poultry. According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds. Bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds were slaughtered last year to limit the spread of the virus. Bird flu symptoms Signs and symptoms of bird flu, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, can include: * Fever (temperature of 100 degrees or greater), or feeling feverish or experiencing chills * Cough * Sore throat * Runny or stuffy nose * Headaches * Fatigue * Eye redness (conjunctivitis) * Difficulty breathing/shortness of breath * Diarrhea * Nausea * Vomiting * Seizures In some cases, infected patients may also experience conjunctivitis, or redness in the eyes, the department says. Those infected with avian influenza experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe, says the health department, explaining that reports of severe illness in humans 'have included fulminant pneumonia leading to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and (even) death.'

{"id": "405", "title": "U.S. News: Person Contracts Bird Flu After Exposure to Cattle", "date": "2024-04-02", "fulltext": "A person in Texas tested positive for avian influenza after exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected with the H5N1 bird flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. It is the second known instance of human infection in the U.S. The person reported eye redness, or conjunctivitis, as the only symptom and is being treated with an antiviral drug. The human health risk of the bird flu remains low for the U.S. general public, the CDC said, but people with close, prolonged exposures to infected animals or their environments are at higher risk. \"At this point, there's nothing that suggests that there is any serious risk of a larger human outbreak,\" said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"I'm trying to understand why the cows are getting infected.\" The previous human case was reported in Colorado in 2022, in a person with direct contact with poultry. The agency said it has been monitoring for infections among people exposed to infected birds since reported outbreaks in U.S. poultry and wild birds began in late 2021. Human illnesses typically have occurred through exposure to infected poultry or wild birds. Sick birds can shed the virus in their saliva, mucus and feces, and humans can become infected when enough virus gets into their eyes, nose or mouth. Infections have also been reported in animals including foxes, bears, seals, minks, cats and dogs. The disease in humans ranges from mild infections, which include upper-respiratory and eye-related symptoms, to severe pneumonia. Since 1997, some 890 human cases have been reported worldwide, with a fatality rate of roughly 50%, the CDC said. \"It's still a very uncommon illness in humans,\" Inglesby said, adding that there may be much milder cases that aren't being detected. The U.S. Agriculture Department reported in late March that unpasteurized milk from sick cattle at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, as well as a throat swab from a cow in Texas, tested positive for the same strain of the virus currently widespread among birds. A few days later, the virus was found in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently added cows from Texas. This is the first time the H5N1 influenza virus has been detected in cattle in the U.S., according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. There was little or no mortality among affected dairy herds, Agriculture Department officials said. Bird flu has historically been a problem for the poultry industry in the U.S. The current outbreak has led to the death of tens of millions of chickens, turkeys and other birds since early 2022. There are no concerns with the safety of the commercial milk supply right now, according to the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration, because dairies must send milk from only healthy animals to processing, and milk must be pasteurized for it to enter interstate commerce for human consumption. --- Jacob Bunge contributed to this article.", "media_outlet": "WSJ", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "yes", "comments": "ascertainment bias mentioned", "feedback_2": "The article reports a human fatality rate of roughly 50% for bird flu.

A person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu, an infection tied to the recent discovery of the virus in dairy cows, health officials said on Monday. The patient is being treated with an antiviral drug and their only reported symptom was eye redness, Texas health officials said. The person had been in contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected, officials reported. The development comes after milk from dairy cows in Texas and Kansas tested positive for bird flu last week and federal agriculture officials confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from Texas. While the infections have raised alarm, health officials have said the risk to people remains low and that the commercial milk supply is safe as such products are pasteurized before being sold. Dairy producers have implemented additional biosecurity efforts in response to the infections, including limiting the amount of traffic into and out of farms as well as restricting visits to employees and essential personnel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday that while the risk to the general public is low, those with close, prolonged and unprotected exposures to infected animals are at greater risk. The CDC will monitor those who may have come into contact with potentially infected animals, the agency said in a statement. \"CDC is working closely with state and federal agencies, including USDA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and local health authorities to further investigate and closely monitor this situation,\" the agency said. The virus has been found in hundreds of mammal species globally in recent years. This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. More than 460 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of infected people got it directly from birds, but scientists have been on guard for any sign of spread among people. It's only the second time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program contracted the illness while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose county, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. The virus can cause a range of illnesses from eye infection and upper respiratory illnesses to more severe cases, such as pneumonia, and has caused death, the CDC said.

{"id": "407", "title": "The largest fresh egg producer in the US has found bird flu in chickens at a Texas plant", "date": "2024-04-02", "fulltext": "The largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S. said Tuesday it had temporarily halted production at a Texas plant after bird flu was found in chickens, and officials said the virus had also been detected at a poultry facility in Michigan. Ridgeland, Mississippi-based Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. said in a statement that approximately 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets, about 3.6% of its total flock, were destroyed after the infection, avian influenza, was found at a facility in Parmer County, Texas. The plant is on the Texas-New Mexico border in the Texas Panhandle about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southwest of Amarillo and about 370 miles (595 kilometers) northwest of Dallas. Cal-Maine said it sells most of its eggs in the Southwestern, Southeastern, Midwestern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Company continues to work closely with federal, state and local government officials and focused industry groups to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks and effectively manage the response, the statement said. Cal-Maine Foods is working to secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers, the statement said. The company said there is no known bird flu risk associated with eggs that are currently in the market and no eggs have been recalled. Eggs that are properly handled and cooked are safe to eat, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The announcement by Cal-Maine comes a day after state health officials said a person had been diagnosed with bird flu after being in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and that the risk to the public remains low. The human case in Texas marks the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal, federal health officials said. In Michigan, Michigan State University's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has detected bird flu in a commercial poultry facility in Ionia County, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. The county is about 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. The department said it received confirmation of the disease Monday from the lab and that it is the fourth time since 2022 that the disease was detected at a commercial facility in Michigan. Department spokesperson Jennifer Holton said Tuesday that state law prohibits the department from disclosing the type of poultry at the facility. The facility has been placed under quarantine and the department does not anticipate any disruptions to supply chains across the state, Holton said. Dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with bird flu last week and federal agriculture officials later confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from Texas. A dairy herd in Idaho has been added to the list after federal agriculture officials confirmed the detection of bird flu in them, according to a Tuesday press release from the USDA.

{"id": "408", "title": "Bird Flu Detected in a Person in Texas: What We Know So Far", "date": "2024-04-02", "fulltext": "A person in Texas has tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1), also known as bird flu, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed. This individual, who was exposed to cattle that were believed to be infected with the virus, reported eye redness—a sign of conjunctivitis—but no other symptoms. The patient is being treated with antiviral medication and is recovering. Avian flu has been ripping through farmed poultry and wild bird populations around the world in recent years. It has also infected mammalian species ranging from foxes, bears and seals to cats and dogs. And in recent weeks, infections have been found in cattle in five U.S. states: Kansas, Texas, Michigan, New Mexico and Idaho and Minnesota. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission so far, and the CDC says the risk to the public remains low. The new human case is the second known to occur in the U.S. The first was in 2022, when a person in Colorado tested positive for the virus via a nasal swab after having direct contact with infected poultry. That patient reported mild fatigue and later recovered. Previous cases of avian flu in humans were deadly, but they involved a different form of the virus than the one that is currently circulating. Scientific American talked to Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, about the latest human case and the risk to human health more broadly. [An edited transcript of the interview follows.] How worried should we be about the human bird flu case in Texas? First of all, there’s some clarification here. Neither of these two cases [in the U.S.] has been an actual influenza infection as you think of a respiratory infection. They both have been basically either a nasal swab detection, for the previous one, or in the case of this one, a conjunctivitis—an eye infection. So this isn’t classic influenza at all. The first one was just someone who was tested routinely. They were working in a barn, depopulating the birds that were dying from flu, and they had some mild symptoms, and they just got tested. They don’t know if the symptoms were related to it, and it could have been that the virus was just picked up in the nose because of just inhaling it in. The second case is a case of conjunctivitis. So that’s not, again, unexpected in that there are receptor sites in the eye for influenza viruses. That’s reassuring. How likely is the virus to spread more widely among people? The risk assessment from both [the World Health Organization] and CDC remains that there is low risk for humans with this virus, and I support that. If you look at the cases that have occurred since 1997, when it first emerged in human cases in Hong Kong, through to mid-2015 to 2016, those years were by far the highest-risk situation. We’ve seen very few cases in humans since then. And part of that is that the virus has changed—it’s mutated to the point of where it is infecting other mammalian species and birds at an increasing rate. But we’ve had no evidence yet that that’s happened for humans or for pigs. And pigs would be the animal species that, to me, would be the sentinel that I’d be most concerned about. Why is H5N1 causing milder human infections now? This virus just is not infecting lower parts of the respiratory tract in humans at this point. Now that can all change in a heartbeat with additional mutations. But at least for now, it’s not an issue. Previously there have been fatal cases of avian flu in humans in other countries, however. What does that tell us about the risk of human spread? We’ve been here before. When we saw a major increase in transmission, in human cases, in Indonesia and Thailand and other countries in the 2003–2007 time period, the message was ‘this is going to be a pandemic virus soon.’ Then nothing happened. Then, in 2012, I was at that time on the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, and we had data presented to that group that essentially said, ‘we’re just one mutation away from the virus becoming a major pandemic virus.’ It didn’t happen. Then, if you look at 2015, that was when we saw the major increase in cases in Africa—in Egypt, along the Nile River Valley, in people raising domestic ducks. That time there were [hundreds of] cases in Egypt alone that year in humans. And the thought was that, you know, ‘it’s just imminent now that we're going to see an influenza pandemic from H5N1.’ Nothing happened. And so I think that we’ve had lessons in the past to be careful about making the leap to ‘this is going to happen.’ At the same time, you know, you have to keep your eye on it. With all the influenza viruses collectively, you have to sleep with one eye open every night if you’re worried about a pandemic. Why were some of those earlier cases of H5N1 so deadly? The virus was able to reach receptor sites and cells deeper in the respiratory tract and cause human infection. And it was obviously a severe issue. But even then, we had no evidence these were person-to-person transmitted cases. The exposures were [traced] back to the animals. We haven’t seen any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Did the current case in the U.S. likely involve a person becoming infected because of contact with a cow? I can’t speak to which animal it was contact-wise, but that could very well be. There was some question as to whether or not there was also contact with birds on the same farm. So either way, it’s clearly an animal exposure. How would we know if the virus was spreading more widely in people? First, you have to have a confirmed case in a human of a respiratory-transmitted virus that then resulted in severe-to-moderate respiratory illness—and then you just start picking up additional human cases in that area. Are scientists watching H5N1 closely to see how it evolves? We’re going to be tracking the virus to see is it changing genetically and if the [avian flu group] 2.3.4.4b is the same virus we’re seeing here with the wild birds. In the humans, we have not seen any changes in the virus yet that would support that it’s now more human-adapted. That’s going to be one thing we’ll be looking for. The second thing is just looking at the epidemiology: Are there people who are in contact with potential cases? I say ‘potential’ because we have not had a respiratory transmitted virus case yet in the U.S. So I think that will be important. If we see one, will we see others around it? Could people become infected by consuming unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat from an infected cow or other animal? Yeah, well, unpasteurized milk and cheeses I would surely avoid. But I’ve been saying that for 50 years for a whole lot of other reasons, too, public-health-wise. Surely, this is just one more addition to that. I think the second thing is, of course, that, at this point, what data we have supports that pasteurization will kill the virus in the milk. But could you actually become infected by drinking milk containing the virus? We don’t know. Will taking the virus down your throat, into your larynx, will that cause the exposure of the virus to cells with the right receptor sites? We don’t know that yet. It’s possible. How is the fact that H5N1 is infecting cows and goats likely to affect the livestock industry? I don’t know. I mean, we’ll know in the weeks ahead. This is the time of the year we expect to see migratory birds bringing the virus into many communities that have not seen the virus for months. And each time that happens it's kind of a throw at the genetic roulette table, and we'll see what happens. We don't know. But it's all the more reason why we need to be better prepared for the next pandemic. At this point, again, the virus, as it is, I don't believe poses a major risk to humans.

{"id": "409", "title": "Person Is Infected With Bird Flu in Texas After Contact With Dairy Cows", "date": "2024-04-02", "fulltext": "The case adds another worrying wrinkle to a global outbreak that has devastated bird and marine mammal populations, and recently appeared in cattle herds. At least one person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu after having contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected, state officials said on Monday. The announcement adds a worrying dimension to an outbreak that has affected millions of birds and sea mammals worldwide and, most recently, cows in the United States. So far, there are no signs that the virus has evolved in ways that would help it spread more easily among people, federal officials have said. The patient worked directly with sick dairy cows, said Lara M. Anton, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. 'We have tested around a dozen symptomatic people who work at dairies, and only the one person has tested positive' for the virus, she said in an email. The patient's primary symptom was conjunctivitis; the individual is being treated with an antiviral drug and is recovering, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Department of Agriculture announced the first cases in dairy herds in Texas and Kansas last week, and a few days later, in an additional herd in Michigan. Preliminary testing suggests that cows in New Mexico and Idaho may also be infected. The virus has been identified as the same version of H5N1, an influenza subtype, that is circulating in North American birds. The C.D.C. is working with state health departments to monitor other people who may have been in contact with infected birds and animals, the agency said on Monday. It also urged people to avoid exposure to sick or dead birds and animals, and to raw milk, feces or other potentially contaminated materials. This is only the second case of H5N1 bird flu in people in the United States; the first was in 2022. The risk to the general public remains low, experts said. But testing and analysis is ongoing, and there are many unanswered questions. 'This is a rapidly evolving situation,' the U.S.D.A. said in its announcement last week. Here's what to know: What is bird flu? Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a group of flu viruses that are primarily adapted to birds. The particular virus in these new cases, called H5N1, was first identified in 1996 in geese in China, and in people in Hong Kong in 1997. In 2020, a new, highly pathogenic form of H5N1 emerged in Europe and spread quickly around the world. In the United States, it has affected more than 82 million farmed birds, the worst bird flu outbreak in U.S. history. Since the virus was first identified, sporadic cases have been found in people in other countries. But a vast majority resulted from prolonged, direct contact with birds. H5N1 does not yet seem to have adapted to spread efficiently among people, experts say. How did cows get bird flu? Cows were not thought to be a species at high risk. 'The fact that they are susceptible -- the virus can replicate, can make them sick -- that is something I wouldn't have predicted,' said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. But this year, reports of sick cows began to emerge in Texas and New Mexico. Dead birds were also found on some of these farms, and laboratory testing confirmed that some cows were infected with bird flu. There are a variety of ways that the virus might have found its way into cattle. The likely route, several experts said, is that infected wild birds, which shed the virus in their feces, saliva and other secretions, contaminated the cows' food or water. But other free-ranging animals known to be susceptible to the virus, such as cats and raccoons, could also have brought the virus onto dairy farms. How have cows been affected? Although the virus is often fatal in birds, it appears to be causing relatively mild illness in cows. 'It's not killing animals, and they seem to be recovering,' said Dr. Joe Armstrong, a veterinarian and cattle production expert at the University of Minnesota Extension. Last week, the U.S.D.A. said that there were no plans to 'depopulate,' or kill, affected herds, which is the standard procedure when poultry flocks are infected with the virus. The disease is primarily affecting older cows, which have developed symptoms that include a loss of appetite, a low-grade fever and a significant drop in milk production. The milk that the cows do produce is often 'thick and discolored,' according to Texas officials. The virus has also been found in unpasteurized milk samples collected from sick cows. It is not yet clear whether the bird flu virus is the sole cause of all the symptoms and illnesses that have been reported, experts cautioned. How widespread is the problem? It's unclear. As of last Friday, the U.S.D.A.'s National Veterinary Services Laboratory had confirmed bird flu infections in two herds in Texas, two herds in Kansas and one herd in Michigan. Initial testing has suggested that additional herds in Texas, New Mexico and Idaho may also have the virus, but those findings have not yet been confirmed by the national laboratory. So far, the virus has been found only in dairy cows and not in beef cattle. But because cows are not routinely tested for bird flu, and the illness has been relatively mild, there could be other infected herds that have escaped detection, experts said. And the movement of cattle between states could transport the virus to new locations. The affected dairy in Michigan had recently imported cows from an infected herd in Texas. When the cows were transported, the animals were not displaying any symptoms. The farm in Idaho had also recently imported cows from an affected state, Idaho officials said. How is it spreading? That is a key, and still unanswered, question. It is possible that the infected cows are picking up the virus independently, especially if shared food or water sources have been contaminated. A more worrisome possibility, however, is that the virus is spreading from cow to cow. On Friday, the U.S.D.A. noted that 'transmission between cattle cannot be ruled out.' Several scientists said that they would be surprised if there were not some degree of cow-to-cow transmission. 'How else could it move so rapidly?' said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. If the virus can spread easily between cows, that could lead to larger, more sustained outbreaks. It would also give the virus more opportunities to adapt to its new mammalian hosts, increasing the risk that it acquires mutations that make it more dangerous to people. How will officials know if bird flu adapts to spread between people? Analyzing the genetic sequence of the virus from infected birds, cows and people can reveal whether H5N1 has acquired mutations that help it spread among people. Scientists have been closely tracking infections in birds and sea mammals and, now, cows. So far, the virus does not seem to have the ability to spread efficiently between people. In 2012, scientists showed that H5N1 was able to spread through air between ferrets -- a popular model for studying transmission of respiratory viruses among people -- after acquiring five mutations. A sample of bird flu isolated from a Chilean man last year had two mutations that indicate adaptation to infecting mammals. But those mutations have previously been seen without the virus evolving further to spread between people, experts said. Is it safe to consume dairy products? Federal officials have stressed that commercially processed milk remains safe to drink. Dairies are required to keep milk from sick animals out of the human food supply, and milk sold across state lines must be pasteurized, a process in which the milk is heated to kill potential pathogens. Pasteurization 'has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk,' the Food and Drug Administration said in a new online guide to milk safety. Dr. Gail Hansen, a veterinary public health expert and independent consultant, agreed that the risk of being infected by pasteurized milk was probably 'very low.' She added, 'I would not want people to stop drinking milk because of it.' But the possibility could not be entirely ruled out, she said, expressing some concern that federal officials had been 'overconfident in the face of so many unknowns.' If cows are shedding virus into their milk before they show signs of illness, that milk could potentially find its way into the commercial milk supply, she said. And different pathogens may require different pasteurization temperatures and durations; the specific conditions required to inactivate this particular virus remained unclear, Dr. Hansen said. The risk of being infected by the virus by consuming unpasteurized, or raw, dairy products remains unknown, the F.D.A. said. Raw milk is known to pose a variety of potential disease risks beyond avian influenza. A person who worked directly with sick dairy cows has contracted bird flu, Texas officials said.

{"id": "410", "title": "A Farm Worker With Avian Flu Means a Rapid Response Is Urgent", "date": "2024-04-02", "fulltext": "The discovery of the country's second human case of H5N1 avian flu, found in a Texas dairy farm worker following an outbreak among cows, is worrying and requires prompt and vigorous action. While officials have so far said the possibility of cow-to-cow transmission \"cannot be ruled out,\" I think we can go further than that. The geography of the outbreak—sick cows in Texas, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio and New Mexico—strongly suggests cows are infecting each other as they move around various farms. The most likely scenario seems to be that a new strain of H5N1 is spreading among cows, rather than the cows being individually infected by sick birds. Avian flu is not known to transmit well among mammals, including humans, and until now, almost all known cases of H5N1 in humans were people in extended close contact with sick birds. But a cow outbreak—something unexpected, as cows aren't highly prone to get this—along with likely transmission between cows, means we need to quickly require testing of all dairy workers on affected farms as well as their close contacts, and sample cows in all the dairy farms around the country. It is possible—and much easier—to contain an early outbreak when an emergent virus isn't yet adapted to a new host and perhaps not as transmissible. If it gets out and establishes a foothold, then all bets are off. With fatality rates estimated up to 50 percent among humans, H5N1 is not something to gamble with. Additionally, H5N1 was found in the unpasteurized milk of sick cows. Unpasteurized milk, already a bad idea, would be additionally dangerous to consume right now. Public officials need to get on top of this quickly, and transparently, telling us the uncertainties as well as their actions. The government needs to gear up to potentially mass-produce vaccines quickly (which we have against H5N1, though they take time to produce) and ensure early supplies for frontline and health care workers. It's possible that worst-case scenarios aren't going to come true—yet.

{"id": "411", "title": "Bird flu detected in dairy worker", "date": "2024-04-02", "fulltext": "A dairy worker in Texas is being treated for bird flu, only the second human case in the United States of an illness caused by a highly virulent virus that has recently rampaged through dairy cows in five states, federal and state officials said Monday. The patient, who experienced eye inflammation as the only symptom, was tested for flu late last week, with confirmatory testing performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the weekend. The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu. The newly emerged case does not change the risk for the general public, which remains low, federal officials said. 'The patient worked directly with sick cows at a dairy, so the virus was most likely transmitted through that close contact,' said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. The case has alarmed disease trackers monitoring for the worst-case scenario: human-to-human transmission of the pathogen, which has happened infrequently worldwide, typically among family members engaged in work with animals. And it raises questions about whether this pathogen is now more easily transmitted among mammals. Texas health officials are working with other state and federal agencies to provide guidance to dairies about precautions workers should take to minimize the risk of transmission from animals and encourage those who become ill to get tested, Van Deusen said. CDC spokesman Kevin Griffis said the investigation into how widely the virus has spread is ongoing. 'At this time, we are not aware that any of the individual's close contacts have experienced any symptoms,' he said. Officials do not yet know the specific route of transmission. While the CDC considers the risk of infection for the general public to be low, people with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection. Still, any time the virus changes 'that makes me sit up and take notice,' said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Its recent emergence in cattle and the likelihood of cow-to-cow transmission represents a worrisome change. This marks the first time the highly pathogenic avian influenza has been identified in U.S. dairy cattle, the American Veterinary Medical Association said in a statement last week. Matt Steele, chief executive of the Kansas Cattlemen's Association, said beef and dairy producers constantly check the health of their animals. If an animal appears sick, they'll pull it aside, take its temperature and call in a veterinarian, if needed. The odds of infected meat or dairy products leaving the farm are 'very, very low,' Steele said, citing a system of checks and balances between the producers and state and federal agencies. 'This isn't really a major disease outbreak' that would heavily impact the meat and dairy market, he said. Human infections with avian influenza viruses are uncommon but have occurred sporadically worldwide. The CDC has been monitoring for illness among people exposed to H5 virus-infected birds since outbreaks were first detected in U.S. wild birds and poultry in 2021. Until now, only one human case had been identified in the United States. In 2022, a person in Colorado tested positive for the same strain of avian flu. The person was involved in culling poultry presumed to have been infected with H5N1 bird flu. The person reported fatigue for a few days as their only symptom and recovered, according to the CDC. Human illnesses with H5N1 bird flu have ranged from mild, such as eye infections and upper respiratory symptoms, to severe illness, such as pneumonia, that have resulted in death in other countries. Experts worry about the potential for viral evolution. There are several scenarios: The virus could remain primarily a threat to animal health and then recede, as it has in the past. It may continue to circulate among animals, but not routinely infect humans. Or, in the worst case, it evolves to spread easily between people and becomes the next pandemic, Rivers said. Such a pandemic would have significant costs to human life, society and the global economy, she said. Pandemic flu has long been the boogeyman of infectious-disease and public health experts because the influenza virus is known to be wily, constantly changing, with an ability to combine with other influenza viruses to form new subtypes. A pandemic flu occurs when a new strain of influenza emerges that can be transmitted easily from person to person, and for which there is little or no natural immunity. The more the virus is able to circulate in mammalian species, the greater the opportunity for the pathogen to mutate to spread more efficiently between humans. Although the H5N1 bird flu has rarely infected humans, among the cases that have been diagnosed, the fatality rate is roughly 50 percent. Rivers said it's important for U.S. policymakers to be proactive. If this strain of bird flu becomes easily spread from human to human, 'the opportunity we have to make a difference is very short,' she said, because there is no immunity in humans and transmission would be fast. 'You can't adopt a wait-and-see attitude.' Bird flu is different from the influenza virus that affects humans. Seasonal flu vaccines for humans do not protect against avian viruses. The CDC, the U.S. Agriculture Department, and the Food and Drug Administration, along with state health and veterinary officials, say they are closely monitoring developments. The CDC has a tool that gauges how likely bird flu will efficiently spread between humans. It was last updated in April 2023, after the virus had spread to a commercial mink farm in Spain. H5 bird flu is widespread among wild birds and has been documented to infect dozens of other mammalian species, but it rarely spreads between them. These viruses have caused outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry flocks, leading to the culling of millions of poultry. Epidemiologists have been worried about the growing number of mammals infected by the highly pathogenic avian influenza - commonly known as HPAI - around the world. Last month, HPAI was found in a baby goat in Minnesota, the first case in U.S. livestock. The virus was detected in dairy herds in Texas and Kansas on March 25. Unpasteurized milk from sick cattle collected from two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, as well as a throat swab from a cow in another dairy in Texas, tested positive. Testing showed the genetic clade to be the same that is widespread among birds globally. Since then, bird flu has spread to additional herds in at least five states, adding evidence that the virus may be spreading cow-to-cow. The strain was confirmed in a Michigan dairy on March 29, and presumptive positive tests have also been reported from Idaho and New Mexico, federal officials said Friday. Preliminary analysis has not found mutations that would make these viruses resistant to FDA-approved antiviral medications for flu, the CDC said Monday. The United States has a small amount of bird flu vaccine that targeted an earlier bird flu strain, part of a program to prepare for strains of influenza virus with pandemic potential. With the latest spread of bird flu, vaccine candidates are being developed and tested that are expected to match the current strain, according to an official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": "talks about viral evolution in bad way", "feedback_2": "The article mentions a human fatality rate of roughly 50% for diagnosed cases of H5N1 bird flu.

{"id": "414", "title": "Egg prices are rising again. An outbreak of bird flu could make things worse", "date": "2024-04-03", "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) — Egg prices have now been steadily rising for months, and your omelette could become even more expensive as poultry farms around the country deal with an outbreak of bird flu. The average price of a dozen Grade A large eggs was $3 in February, according to the latest Consumer Price Index, up from around $2 in the fall. While egg prices are down from a record $4.82 in January 2023 — after a widespread bird flu outbreak ravaged farms in the prior year — they're now at the highest level since April 2023. And it may not get better anytime soon. Cal-Maine Foods, America's largest egg producer, said earlier this week that it culled about 1.6 million hens and 337,000 young chickens after some tested positive for a \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" at one of the company's facilities in Texas, Cal-Maine said in a release. The company produces brands such as Farmhouse Eggs, Sunups, Sunny Meadow, Egg-Land's Best and Land O' Lakes eggs. \"Production at the facility has temporarily ceased,\" the company said. \"[The virus] is still present in the wild bird population and the extent of possible future outbreaks, with heightened risk during the migration seasons, cannot be predicted.\" As egg prices reached a record early last year, Cal-Maine, which controls about 20% of the market, reported a few months later that its revenue doubled and profit surged 718%. The culling represented about 3.6% of the company's total flock as of early March. Cal-Maine did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on what the bird flu outbreak means for its egg prices. Bird flu has been detected at other farms across the country. Michigan's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced Tuesday that it found evidence of bird flu at a commercial poultry facility in Ionia County. Last month, the virus was detected in animals at farms in Texas, Kansas and Minnesota. \"The current risk to the public remains minimal,\" Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement. \"It is important for us as an industry to maintain a high level of vigilance. State and national agencies will continue to provide updated guidance as developments warrant.\" If egg producers aren't able to keep up with demand because they've had to cull animals due to bird flu, then that can raise prices. Companies, however, do try to mitigate those effects, but it's unclear if that would be enough to prevent price hikes altogether. \"Cal-Maine Foods is working to secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers,\" the company said.", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "[The virus] is still present in the wild bird population and the extent of possible future outbreaks, with heightened risk during the migration seasons, cannot be predicted.", "affirm_why_count": 1, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "While egg prices are down from a record $4.82 in January 2023 — after a widespread bird flu outbreak ravaged farms in the prior year — they're now at the highest level since April 2023.", "affirm_keywords_statement_2": "Cal-Maine Foods, America's largest egg producer, said earlier this week that it culled about 1.6 million hens and 337,000 young chickens after some tested positive for a 'highly pathogenic avian influenza' at one of the company's facilities in Texas, Cal-Maine said in a release.", "affirm_keywords_statement_4": "As egg prices reached a record early last year, Cal-Maine, which controls about 20% of the market, reported a few months later that its revenue doubled and profit surged 718%.", "affirm_keywords_statement_5": "Cal-Maine did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on what the bird flu outbreak means for its egg prices.", "affirm_keywords_statement_6": "Bird flu has been detected at other farms across the country.", "affirm_keywords_statement_7": "Michigan's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced Tuesday that it found evidence of bird flu at a commercial poultry facility in Ionia County.", "affirm_keywords_statement_8": "Last month, the virus was detected in animals at farms in Texas, Kansas and Minnesota.", "affirm_keywords_statement_9": "If egg producers aren't able to keep up with demand because they've had to cull animals due to bird flu, then that can raise prices.", "affirm_keywords_statement_10": "Cal-Maine Foods is working to secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers.", "affirm_keywords_count": 9, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "\"The current risk to the public remains minimal,\" Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement.", "deny_transmissible_count": 1, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "415", "title": "Response to bird flu outbreak is 'robust,' CDC says, although risk to public remains low", "date": "2024-04-03", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Bird flu is affecting a growing number of cattle herds in the US, and these infections have led to only the second known human case in the nation, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been no human-to-human spread in the US, but there have been sporadic cases of people sharing the bird flu virus in other parts of the world, so the CDC says it is watching the situation closely. Like all viruses, H5N1 has the potential to mutate to become more of a threat to humans. \"The risk overall for the general public remains low,\" Dr. Nirav D. Shah, the agency's principal deputy director, said Wednesday. \"But make no mistake, the CDC is activated as a result of these findings. We are taking this situation extremely, extremely seriously and are actively engaged in making sure that the public health response is robust.\" The risk is considered low, in part, because when humans have caught this version of the virus, it's typically those who have close contact with sick animals. The infections usually stop there. \"So it may go from a bird or a chicken to a human, and that human may indeed pass it on to a spouse, for example, but what we don't see thereafter is sustained transmission from human to human,\" Shah said. The latest case — in a person in Texas who had exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected — was mild, officials said, but humans can get severely ill and die from the disease. \"So even though we haven't seen sustained transmission, we take this seriously, and that's why the CDC has sprung into action,\" Shah said. Shah said the agency and its local public health partners have been watching out for anyone who may have interacted with these herds and may have bird flu symptoms. They are testing only people with potential symptoms because of a concern over false positives. About 15 people have been tested in this outbreak, the CDC says, and only one had the virus. The Texas patient's only symptom was red eyes, and the CDC notes that it is not one typically associated with this flu, which more often causes a cough, fever or shortness of breath. \"In this respect, we want to be testing more people rather than fewer people, so that's why we went ahead and greenlit the testing for anybody with symptoms who have been exposed,\" Shah said. Doctors treated the Texas patient with an antiviral medication commonly used for the more familiar flu virus, and the person went into isolation. If the virus does mutate and spread among humans, the CDC said, it is prepared and can use existing products to detect and protect against it. The strain that was recovered from the latest person who was sick is the same version as in the sick cows and as has been circulating in birds. \"We have not seen any changes to the genome that would suggest a reduced effectiveness of either vaccines, [the antiviral drug] Tamiflu or diagnostic tests,\" Shah said. Scientists discovered the first cows sick with the virus in two dairies in Texas in March, the first cows known to be infected with bird flu. More humans may have been exposed to the virus since the US Department of Agriculture said Monday that it had detected the flu in a herd of dairy cows in New Mexico and five additional dairy herds in Texas. This was the first time the virus had been found in cows in New Mexico. In total, seven herds have been affected by bird flu in Texas, two in Kansas, one in Michigan and one in New Mexico, the USDA said. It is also suspected in a herd in Idaho, but those test results are still being analyzed. Since the start of this outbreak of bird flu in January 2022, more than 82 million poultry in 48 states have been affected, according to the CDC. Cases were also detected in 9,253 wild birds, although the true number is probably much higher. The virus has shown up in relatively fewer mammals, although those numbers have also been growing. Baby goats, ducks, geese, deer, foxes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, pet cats and other animals have tested positive. Watching the virus jump to cows has been a concern, said Dr. Thomas Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"It is important whenever there's a change — and this is a change that cattle are infected for the first time that we know about, and this is only the second human case in the US that's been detected — every time there's such a change, we need to dig into that and make sure there's nothing more than just a single one-off case from industrial exposure,\" he said. Shah said people shouldn't be alarmed by the official name for the virus: highly pathogenic avian influenza. \"That name, in and of itself, may raise the blood pressure of many people who are reading or watching. The 'highly pathogenic' part of the name refers to its virulence and severity in birds, not humans,\" he said. \"Indeed, if you are a migratory bird, this virus is bad news.\" Ducks and geese can carry the virus without appearing sick, but poultry aren't always so lucky. Highly pathogenic avian influenza carries \"very high mortality rates\" among chickens and turkeys, and farmers are concerned because it has continued to spread despite their best efforts to contain it. Because the virus spreads easily and can kill birds quickly, farmers usually have to cull even uninfected birds to prevent a wider outbreak. On Tuesday, Michigan reported cases in a commercial poultry facility. On Wednesday, the nation's largest egg producer found bird flu in a Texas facility. Cal-Maine Foods said it will have to depopulate 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets at its Texas facility, according to state Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, who called it \"absolutely devastating news for Cal-Marine and the entire Panhandle region, which has already suffered so much already.\" People who work with sick birds have had to take precautions, Inglesby said, but everyone doesn't have to get rid of their bird feeders. Studies have shown that bird flu may spread to songbirds, but the ones that typically gather at feeders — such as cardinals, sparrows and blue birds — and those you may see on the street like pigeons and crows do not typically carry bird flu viruses that would be a threat to humans, according to the CDC. However, \"it's always a good idea to wash your hands when you're interacting with wild birds,\" Inglesby said. With cows, the recommendation is that they be put into a special pen for sick animals, and they typically recover in seven to 10 days. Based on current knowledge, ranchers do not have to kill sick cows, Shah said. None of the cows in the sick herds have died from the infection as of Wednesday, he said. The cows probably caught the virus when they encountered wild migratory birds; however, the USDA's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service said it couldn't rule out cow-to-cow transmission, based on the spread of the illness among a herd in Michigan. The virus didn't appear to have any kind of respiratory transmission but more likely spread through infected milk. \"That appears to be the leading theory at this point,\" Inglesby said. Although the virus can be found in high concentrations in milk from sick cows, it does not pose a threat to humans who drink milk or eat dairy products because most milk in the US is pasteurized and has to be so in order to be sold across state lines. The pasteurization process inactivates viruses before the product can go to market. The US Food and Drug Administration continues to remind people that raw milk can pose a serious health risk to those who drink it. \"Before the situation at hand, CDC and FDA's position was stay away from raw milk. Now what we've done is add an asterisk to that and said, 'and we really mean it,' \" Shah said. Typically, the US has higher production of milk in the spring, the USDA said, and the infections in cows shouldn't hurt the nation's food supply. The agency says the milk lost from symptomatic cattle to date is \"too limited\" to have a major impact and shouldn't impact the price of milk. The USDA and the CDC said they will continue working with the industry and with local public health departments to monitor the situation and to encourage vets and farmers to report sick animals quickly so the impact of the virus can be limited.", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_3": "It is important whenever there's a change — and this is a change that cattle are infected for the first time that we know about, and this is only the second human case in the US that's been detected — every time there's such a change, we need to dig into that and make sure there's nothing more than just a single one-off case from industrial exposure.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Like all viruses, H5N1 has the potential to mutate to become more of a threat to humans.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "If the virus does mutate and spread among humans, the CDC said, it is prepared and can use existing products to detect and protect against it.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "The virus has shown up in relatively fewer mammals, although those numbers have also been growing.

But after absorbing their shock, several admitted there was evidence to suggest bovine infection could happen; it just hadn’t been reported with this particular strain of influenza virus until now. The person had contact with dairy cattle that are believed to have been infected with the virus, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement. It went on to say that the individual’s only symptom is eye inflammation infection of the conjunctiva, the tissue surrounding the eye. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the infected individual is doing well and is being treated with the influenza antiviral oseltamivir, sold as Tamiflu. The individual was instructed to isolate to reduce the risk of infecting others, and to date there’s no indication of onward spread, Shah said. Related: Tracking the bird flu, experts see a familiar threat and a virus whose course is hard to predict. “We are not aware of reports that any of this individual’s close contacts have developed any symptoms,” he told STAT. The person was tested late last week, with confirmatory testing taking place at the CDC over the weekend. The CDC is not currently running any other confirmatory H5 tests, Shah said. “The fact that there are not other samples cooking right now is reassuring, insofar as that we’re not aware of other individuals who are symptomatic following an exposure to livestock,” he added. “We are still out there looking, to be very clear,” he said. “Our antennae are up and we have been working with state public health officials in a number of jurisdictions to look for individuals who report signs and symptoms of illness, to make sure they know how to get tested.” NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy Three states Texas, Kansas, and Michigan have recently reported they have had confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in cattle; New Mexico and Idaho have also reported outbreaks in cattle that are presumed to have been caused by H5N1. The virus doesn’t kill the cattle, but milk production is lowered and the animals’ feeding is reduced. Owners of implicated herds have been told to destroy milk produced by infected cattle, though if milk from infected animals made its way into the food chain, pasteurization could kill the virus, the CDC statement said. Up until now, cows have not been on the ever-lengthening list of animals that have been known to be susceptible to this virus. Infections of the highly pathogenic bird flu, a term that describes how it behaves in poultry, have been detected in many other mammals, though, including big cats, bears, foxes, skunks, sea lions, and seals. Despite the alarming increase in the past few years of the virus’s geographic range and the number of species it has been seen to infect, both the World Health Organization and the CDC currently assess its risk to people as low. The news of the case in Texas does not change that, Shah said. Trending Now: This AI company scans penis pictures for STIs. Its unproven tech is in an FDA gray zone. H5N1 bird flu has been high on the worry list of experts on emerging diseases for the past two decades. Over that time there have been nearly 900 human infections in 23 countries; just over half of those infections have been fatal. But in recent years the strain of the virus circulating in many parts of the world, including the United States, seems to trigger human infections less frequently than earlier versions of the virus did. And when human cases caused by this strain occur, they are typically mild. A case in point was the country’s first H5 infection, which occurred in 2022. A man who was involved in culling infected poultry in Colorado reported feeling fatigued; he tested positive for the virus. It was unclear if he was actually even infected or simply had viruses in his nose that were picked up by a nasal swab test. The low rate of human infections and the mildness of most cases when they occur has counterbalanced concern about the virus’s astonishing spread. But people who have studied influenza and this virus in particular for years do not know what to make of its movement into so many different animal species. Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., called the infections in cows “a head scratcher,” saying he would not have figured cattle to be on the list of animals susceptible to this virus. “This particular version of H5 is teaching us a number of things we thought we knew weren’t right,” Webby said. He termed the news of the Texas case “not unexpected, but always a concern.” Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, said the move into cows expands the virus’ range, “but I’m not sure what it portends for humans and swine.” Osterholm said he would be more concerned if there were word that the virus had been found to be infecting pigs. Pigs can be infected with human and avian flu viruses and co-infection of more than one type of virus in pigs can produce reassortants hybrid viruses that might be more able to infect people. As of now, he believes the risk H5N1 poses is not changed by the infection of cattle. “This all could change in a heartbeat with additional mutations.

{"id": "417", "title": "Texas sees state's first human case of bird flu; it is 2nd in US", "date": "2024-04-03", "fulltext": "Less than a week after sick dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas tested positive for bird flu, Texas state officials reported that a person in the state has been infected with the virus after coming into close contact with the infected cows. The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a news alert Monday that the patient became 'ill following contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected with avian influenza' and that their primary symptom was conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye. Officials said it is the first human case of the highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in Texas and the second in the U.S. They said it is 'believed to be associated with the recent detections of avian influenza A(H5N1) in dairy cows.' Bird flu risk to general public Federal and state health authorities are investigating the outbreak, the news alert said. It added that the risk to general public is low. 'Avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have only rarely been transmitted from person to person,' authorities said. 'As such, the risk to the general public is believed to be low; however, people with close contact with affected animals suspected of having avian influenza A(H5N1) have a higher risk of infection.' The state department of health, however, has warned health care providers to be vigilant about the sign and symptoms of bird flu, especially among people who have regular contact with animals. Bird flu in dairy cattle in Kansas, Texas The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that the highly contagious pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) had been found in unpasteurized clinical samples of milk from ill cows at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, plus a swab from a dairy cow in Texas. The agency said its officials, along with the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state veterinary and public health authorities, were investigating an illness detected primarily in older dairy cows in those states, as well as in New Mexico. Wild migratory birds are believed to be the source of the infection, the USDA had said. What is bird flu? Bird flu is a disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted among birds. Avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and the USDA, are classified into two groups: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI, often seen in wild birds) and HPAI, found mostly in domestic poultry. According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds. Bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds were slaughtered last year to limit the spread of the virus. Bird flu symptoms Signs and symptoms of bird flu, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, can include: Fever (temperature of 100 degrees or greater), or feeling feverish or experiencing chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Headaches Fatigue Eye redness (conjunctivitis) Difficulty breathing/shortness of breath Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting Seizures In some cases, infected patients may also experience conjunctivitis, or redness in the eyes, the department says. Those infected with avian influenza experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe, says the health department, explaining that reports of severe illness in humans 'have included fulminant pneumonia leading to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and (even) death.'

Cal-Maine Foods on Tuesday announced chickens at its facility in Parmer County, in the state's southwestern panhandle, tested positive for pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) resulting in slaughter of nearly 2 million chickens: 1.6 million hens and 337,000 pullets (young hens). The announcement came less than 24 hours after the Centers for Disease Control reported a person in Texas had been infected with the virus after coming into close contact with dairy cattle and just over a week after sick dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas tested positive for the virus. The culled Texas chickens represent about 3.6% of the company's total flock as of Tuesday, the supplier wrote in a news release. Production at the Texas facility temporarily ceased while the company follows the protocols prescribed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the company said. Bird flu is spreading in a few states: Keeping your bird feeders clean can help. Cal-Maine Foods is the largest producer of eggs in the nation. Headquartered in Ridgeland, Mississippi, Cal-Maine Foods is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the nation and said it sells most of its eggs in states across the Southwest, Southeast, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic. The company said it remains dedicated to robust biosecurity programs across its locations; however, no farm is immune from HPAI. HPAI is still present in the wild bird population and the extent of possible future outbreaks, with heightened risk during the migration seasons, cannot be predicted. Cal-Maine Foods said it was working to secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers. Human case of bird flu found in Texas: Case comes on heels of outbreak of virus among cattle. Person infected with bird flu in Texas. In a separate news alert this week, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported the patient became ill following contact with cows presumed to be infected with avian influenza and that their primary symptom was conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye. The person who tested positive for bird flu in Texas is only the second known human case in the United States, state and federal officials said this week. Bird flu in dairy cattle in Kansas, Texas. Last week the USDA announced HPAI had been found in unpasteurized clinical samples of milk from ill cows at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, plus a swab from a dairy cow in Texas. Wild migratory birds are believed to be the source of the infection, the USDA said, and viral testing and epidemiologic efforts remained underway. What is bird flu? Bird flu is a disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted among birds. Avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and USDA, are classified into two groups: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) (often seen in wild birds) and HPAI, found mostly in domestic poultry. According to the CDC, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, and HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds. Bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds were slaughtered last year to limit the spread of the virus. Bird flu spread to humans is low risk, USDA says. The first case of avian influenza in a person in the United States was reported in Colorado in April 2022. Federal and state health authorities are investigating the outbreaks, and the USDA said the risk to the general public contracting is low as the viruses have only rarely been transmitted from person to person. However, people with close contact with affected animals suspected of having avian influenza A have a higher risk of infection, Texas health officials wrote in a news alert earlier this week. Bird flu symptoms in humans. Human infection with the bird flu can happen during close contact with infected birds or when people touch sick birds or their saliva, mucus, and feces, the CDC said. People contract the virus when it gets into their eyes, nose, or mouth, or when it is inhaled. Those who contract the virus often experience mild illnesses including an eye infection and upper respiratory symptoms or no symptoms at all, while others can develop a severe sometimes fatal disease like pneumonia.

Indications a bird may be infected with avian influenza include: * Loss of appetite, lethargy * Sudden death without prior symptoms * Eyelid swelling * Twisting of the head and neck * Purple discoloration to body parts including waddle and legs.

{"id": "419", "title": "Bird flu outbreak is an 'evolving situation.' Here's what to know about symptoms, spread.", "date": "2024-04-03", "fulltext": "Many Americans are brimming with questions after officials in Texas this week announced the state's first case of bird flu in a human. On Monday, Texas health officials said a person became infected with bird flu, or avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, after close contact with infected cows. Last week sick dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas tested positive for bird flu. Bird flu was later reported in a Michigan dairy herd that included cows transported from Texas. Cattle in New Mexico and Idaho are also presumed to be positive for the disease, officials said. The only symptom reported by the Texas patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis, according to an update Monday from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials say the risk to public health remains low. They note that there are steps people can take to curb the spread of the potentially dangerous virus. The events in Texas, they say, raise future concerns about how the bird flu virus evolves. \"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, told USA TODAY. \"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\" But if the virus is being transmitted from cow to cow, Diel stressed, it's important to continue monitoring the virus in the long term to see whether there are potential mutations that could cause spillover into other species, including humans. CDC says cases rising: What to know about meningococcal disease Click to view image. How does it spread? Bird flu primarily spreads through contact with infected birds. Most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals. Avian flu viruses infect birds' respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which causes them to shed virus via their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC said. Humans and other mammals can get it when they get enough virus in their eyes, nose, mouth or inhale it into their lungs. People who have had close contact or unprotected contact for long periods of time are at greater risk of infection. The disease can cause mild upper respiratory issues or severe illness, including pneumonia and multiple-organ failure that leads to death. In the U.S., the disease tends to spread from wild birds. However, outbreaks in commercial poultry or backyard flocks that led to deaths have been reported in 48 states since February 2022. Officials identified the latest bird flu cases in unpasteurized milk from sick cattle at dairy farms in Kansas and Texas, in addition to a positive throat swab of a cow at another Texas dairy farm. This spread to cows is believed to be the first for the species. Cornell researchers believe the virus originally transmitted to Texas dairy cows via contaminated water and other food sources from infected birds migrating through the area. The virus then likely spread among cows who were near each other or near the birds, however, there isn't yet definitive proof of this, said Diel, who is an associate professor of virology. In early March, Dr. Elisha Frye, an assistant professor of practice at Cornell's Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, received a call about an outbreak among Texas dairy herds of a disease of unknown origin. Samples of milk and manure and nasal swabs from the cattle showed bird flu was present. Researchers also found evidence of bird flu in testing of dead birds and one of three cats found dead at the dairy facilities around the same time. \"It was kind of the same timeline as when we found it in the cattle samples, but it did kind of link it together,\" Frye told USA TODAY. \"The birds, the cat and milk from the cows all having the same pathogen in them made sense at the time for that being the main cause of illness.\" Should we be worried about humans getting bird flu? It's rare for humans to be infected with bird flu. The only other human case in the U.S. occurred in 2022, in a person incarcerated in a Colorado prison who was exposed to poultry infected with avian flu. On Tuesday, the CDC said the current public health risk is low, and there is no person-to-person spread of bird flu so far. That is a vital measurement that would prompt concern for the spread of the disease. There remains an increased risk for poultry, livestock and farmers and workers in these sectors, as well as veterinarians, veterinary staff and first-responders who respond to cases, officials said.

What about dairy products? On Tuesday, the largest U.S. chicken egg manufacturer reported positive tests for bird flu at its facility in the Texas Panhandle. In a news release, Cal-Maine Foods said production at the Panhandle facility stopped temporarily, following protocols to prevent bird flu set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Personnel at the company killed about 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 young hens to curb the spread of the virus. There isn't as simple of a solution to reduce risk of bird flu, since the eggs can carry the virus, so the traditional method has been to destroy products and kill the poultry, said Diel, of Cornell. Among dairy cows, milk from animals suspected or confirmed to have the virus is being removed from human food supplies. However, even if milk from infected cows makes it to the commercial milk supply, pasteurization is effective inactivating bacteria and viruses, including influenza, according to a March 29 joint news release from the CDC, USDA and the Food and Drug Administration. In addition to protecting against bird flu, pasteurization is central to other health efforts. The FDA says that unpasteurized raw milk can have dangerous microorganisms dangerous to human health. Dr. Meghan Davis, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former dairy veterinarian, said it's important to note differences among industries in poultry and cattle, and how the virus gets treated: Chicken culling, or killing, has been a steadfast way to curb disease spread, whereas this is a first for cattle, and it appears cows aren't getting as sick. She said people at risk if they consume raw milk and cheese or live near an area with intensive dairy production. The spread among cows is a red flag for public health officials and veterinary care professionals. But Davis said she was encouraged by the fact that the person with bird flu only had mild eye problems and the cows had mild symptoms. \"If that's the worst we see, then that's good,\" she said. \"But we don't yet know.\" How can the spread of bird flu be stopped? The latest developments are reminders for Americans to take standard precautions when storing, cooking and consuming food, said Darin Detwiler, a professor of food policy at Northeastern University, who has advised the USDA and FDA on food safety. The recommendations include frequent hand-washing when preparing food, properly cooking eggs and meat and reducing consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. Detwiler believes consumers should be proactive if they have concerns about outbreaks. \"That's our power as consumers that are stakeholders in this,\" he told USA TODAY. \"We don't have to wait until we're harmed to voice our support or concern over some of these issues.\" Other ways to avoid contracting bird flu include eliminating unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry or domesticated birds, or other sick or dead wild or domesticated animals. This includes contact with animal feces, waste or materials contaminated by animals suspected or confirmed with bird flu. People working directly with animals who could be infected should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks, ideally approved particulate respirators such as N95 masks, as well as goggles, gloves, boots and boot covers. Additionally, they should use fluid-resistant coveralls and disposable head covers or hair covers. People who have spent time near animals confirmed or suspected of being sick should be monitored for signs and symptoms for 10 days after the exposure. This includes those who were wearing PPE.

{"id": "420", "title": "How prepared the U.S. is for a bird flu pandemic", "date": "2024-04-03", "fulltext": "Federal officials are preparing for the possibility of additional human cases of bird flu, testing components to create a vaccine after a Texas dairy worker was infected with the highly virulent virus, even as they stress the United States remains far from needing to activate a full-blown emergency response. Two candidate vaccine viruses—essentially the building blocks manufacturers use to produce a vaccine—appear well matched to protect against the H5N1 strain circulating among dairy cattle and birds, according to federal health officials. It'd probably be weeks to months before those shots could first be made available if needed, according to a Health and Human Services official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe an ongoing investigation. Top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the agency is well poised to detect if a person has H5N1 through the agency's regular surveillance for seasonal flu at more than 100 public health labs in all states as well as enhanced monitoring put in place in 2022 for anyone who has been exposed to birds infected with that strain. \"CDC and the whole U.S. government is taking this situation very seriously,\" CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in an interview. \"We had not seen avian flu in cattle prior to last week. That is new. It's a reservoir for virus to circulate and potentially, change.\" The development underscores critical questions about whether the country is equipped to handle an influenza outbreak after the coronavirus pandemic, the worst global health crisis in a century, exposed the weaknesses in the nation's public health infrastructure and decimated the public's trust in key federal agencies. More than half a dozen federal officials say their job is to prepare for the worst but said risk to the general public remains low. H5N1 was first identified in geese in China in 1996, but outbreaks in the past haven't led to an explosion of cases in humans. The heightened attention on bird flu comes after the virulent H5N1 strain was recently identified in U.S. dairy cattle for the first time. Federal and state officials announced Monday that a dairy worker in Texas is being treated for bird flu, marking the second-ever human case of this bird flu strain in the United States. The patient—who experienced eye inflammation as the only symptom—was exposed to cattle presumed to be infected with the virus. Disease trackers are monitoring for additional cases, particularly whether the virus can jump from human to human, which has happened infrequently and would be cause for more alarm. \"Why I feel we can say the risk of avian flu remains low to the public is because the virus we are seeing in the cattle and in this one human case is the same genetic virus that we were seeing in poultry,\" Cohen said, meaning the virus has not yet evolved to spread easily in humans. Since bird flu isn't a novel virus, some experts believe the country is better prepared to tackle such an outbreak than covid, but cautioned against overconfidence. Others pointed to the drastic cut in funding for pandemic preparedness. \"Federal funding for pandemic influenza has not kept up with the threat, even by the government's own assessments,\" Tom Daschle, former Senate majority leader and head of the Coalition To Stop Flu, which includes public health organizations and vaccine manufacturers, said in a statement Tuesday. The government group responsible for defining requirements for medical countermeasures called for $1.15 billion in funding for pandemic influenza for 2025, Daschle said. But the $335 million in Biden's 2025 budget request fell far short. (Congress appropriated $335 million for pandemic influenza preparedness in the most recent appropriations bill.) Significant cuts to preparedness funding were also made two weeks ago in a bipartisan appropriations package, Daschle said. That funding could have been used to speed vaccine development and manufacturing, improve diagnostics and early warning capabilities, and ensure the public health workforce on the front lines is adequately resourced, he said. Detecting changes in the virus's pattern starts with surveillance. When there is a presumptive positive test, state health departments begin an investigation and send specimens to the CDC for confirmatory testing, said Vivien Dugan, who heads the agency's influenza division. The CDC conducts extensive lab testing and analysis to determine the risk to public health; it expects to finish sequencing the sample from the infected dairy worker this week. Since bird flu outbreaks have become widespread globally in recent years, the CDC and the Agriculture Department have enhanced surveillance—closely monitoring anyone who has been exposed to infected birds or poultry infected with H5N1 for 10 days. More than 8,000 people have been monitored in all the 50 states, D.C., New York City, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and the Northern Marianas. Until this week, the only positive case was in Colorado in 2022. If an outbreak in humans occurs, quickly scaling up vaccination would be paramount. The nation's 10-year playbook to modernize flu vaccination sets a goal of delivering first doses of a vaccine within 12 weeks of the declaration of an influenza pandemic. Federal officials point to some good news: Manufacturing a vaccine to match this specific strain of the virus and then mass producing it is vastly easier than the effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine. That's because there are already vaccines to combat the bird flu. They can be altered, experts say, to better protect against this specific strain. This scenario would probably only happen if there's fairly widespread human-to-human transmission. But there would be trade-offs. Manufacturers have limited capacity to produce flu vaccine. Manufacturers are now in the midst of producing the estimated 156 million to 170 million doses of the annual seasonal flu vaccine to be given in the fall. It would be a risky political decision to disrupt that production and switch to making millions of doses of a new shot, public health officials and experts have said. \"We have a n of 1,\" said CDC's Dugan, referring to the single human case. \"It's a good news story that we have bulk vaccine in [a government stockpile] but I don't think we should assume that all Americans will get jabs,\" said another federal health official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of an ongoing investigation. Those who do become infected with bird flu could be treated with antiviral drugs the Food and Drug Administration has approved for the flu. Experts and officials said there haven't been any signs that the current strain would be resistant to those therapeutics. The nation's Strategic National Stockpile has an emergency supply of antivirals that are also available on the commercial market. \"In the wake of our experiences with covid-19, it has become increasingly clear that some individuals show a preference for therapeutic interventions post-infection over preventative vaccination,\" Taylor Sexton, the executive director of the Medical Countermeasures Coalition, wrote in an email. \"Vaccines and therapeutics are two sides of the same coin when we are fighting a pathogen, and both remain critical.\"", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "It's a reservoir for virus to circulate and potentially, change.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "\"We had not seen avian flu in cattle prior to last week.

{"id": "421", "title": "Here's the rundown on bird flu's risks, impacts", "date": "2024-04-03", "fulltext": "After a dairy worker in Texas was infected with a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, disease trackers worry the recent outbreak among cattle could develop into a larger threat. The risk to the general public remains low, but experts are concerned about the possibility of the H5N1 virus evolving and more easily spreading from birds to other mammals. Here's what to know about bird flu, its symptoms and treatment, and its risk to humans and pets. What is bird flu? Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in more than 9,000 wild birds and has affected more than 82 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since early 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm. Can humans catch bird flu? It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds - whether the birds are dead or alive - or with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces. Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks - probably from eating infected wild birds - experts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. Two human cases have been reported in the United States, including the case in Texas, which the CDC announced Monday. The first case was in 2022, when a person in Colorado with direct exposure to poultry tested positive for the same strain. Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis - an eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes - to more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said. The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain. A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus - by sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example - to develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia, he said, and then the fatality rate is very high. What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans? Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms - fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing. The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the past 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said. Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat. How is it treated? People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said. Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans? Yes, there are vaccines for the bird flu. But they would need to be tested to determine whether they are a match for this specific strain. Vaccine manufacturing would then need to be scaled up and mass-produced. Can bird flu kill humans? Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare. According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and February 2024, 887 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 were reported globally from 23 countries. Of those who were infected, there were 462 deaths. While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Could bird flu become the next pandemic? Each time there is highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person. That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people. Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchange of genetic material is a random event. If anything, the odds are against it, Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although the strain has infected some mammals - including mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm in October 2022 - that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans, he said. Can dogs and cats catch bird flu? Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said. Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons. If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection, Cardona said. Is there an impact to the nation's dairy supply? Federal agencies are reassuring the public about the nation's dairy supply after the bird flu was recently found in dairy cows. Since milk products are pasteurized, there continues to be no concern about the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply, the Food and Drug Administration said in a notice on its website. Only milk from healthy animals is authorized to be distributed into interstate commerce for humans to consume, the agency said, adding that pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza. That means there hasn't been much impact on the country's supply of milk or the cost of dairy products. Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs? No. Humans cannot become infected by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs. However, according to the CDC, uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia. The CDC advises that it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States. Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry - and other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry - are typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products, she said. They don't even make it into your pet food. What about my backyard chickens? People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said. Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease. Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying. People who have backyard chickens should take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said. Does risk vary by state or country? Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds, and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable, Iqbal said. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world. Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu? China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality. But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks. Britain, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly. In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds that may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed. Should you worry birds in your area are spreading avian flu? Wild birds - such as ducks, geese and swans - are most likely to be infected with this strain of bird flu, according to the CDC. It can easily be spread to poultry, like chickens and turkey. However, the most common songbirds or other birds found in backyards - like cardinals, robins and pigeons - don't usually carry bird flu viruses dangerous to poultry or humans. Generally, people should avoid direct contact with wild birds, the CDC states. What precautions are federal and state health officials recommending? Federal and state health officials are recommending that people avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals, including cattle, as well as animal carcasses, raw milk, feces, litter or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection. People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or food products, including unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheeses, from animals with confirmed or suspected bird flu. CDC is recommending that farmers and owners of poultry, backyard flock and livestock wear personal protective equipment, such as N95 masks, eye protection and gloves, as well as wash their hands thoroughly when in direct contact - or entering any buildings - with sick or dead birds or other animals, carcasses, or feces or litter of potentially infected animals. People exposed to birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection should be monitored for symptoms of illness for 10 days after the last known exposure, even if they were wearing recommended personal protective equipment. http://www.washingtonpost.com WP20240403faq-birdflu", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": "it doesn't specify that this strain might have a lower mortality rate", "feedback_2": "The article reports a high human mortality rate from bird flu, citing 462 deaths out of 887 cases.

{"id": "423", "title": "Largest U.S. egg producer detects bird flu at Texas plant", "date": "2024-04-03", "fulltext": "The largest egg producer in the United States said Tuesday that it temporarily ceased operations at one of its Texas facilities after detecting bird flu in chickens—the latest in a steady uptick of cases among U.S. farm animals in recent weeks. Cal-Maine Foods said it culled about 1.6 million hens and 337,000 pullets (young hens) after some of its chickens at a Parmer County, Texas, facility tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild and domestic birds. A dairy worker in Texas was being treated for the virus that causes avian influenza, becoming only the second known human case in the United States, state and federal officials said Monday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the person tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The culled chickens at Cal-Maine Foods represent 3.6 percent of its flock as of March 2, it said. The company said no farm is immune from HPAI but added that it remains dedicated to robust biosecurity programs across its locations. Minnesota officials reported the first infection of bird flu among livestock in the United States last month, when a juvenile goat living on a farm with infected chickens tested positive. Last month, bird flu was also detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas. Later that week, U.S. officials said that cows in Michigan had tested positive and that there were presumptive positive tests among cows in Idaho and New Mexico, suggesting that the virus may be spreading among cattle. On Tuesday, Michigan's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced that bird flu was detected at a commercial poultry plant in Ionia County, the fourth detection of HPAI in a commercial facility since the virus was first spotted in the state in 2022. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also said Tuesday that cases were detected in a dairy cow herd in Idaho. Officials have said the risk to human health remains low. But the CDC has warned that people with unprotected exposure to infected birds or other animals, including livestock, are at greater risk of infection. People should also avoid uncooked or undercooked food, unpasteurized milk and raw cheese, according to the CDC. Cooking eggs or poultry to an internal temperature of about 165 degrees Fahrenheit generally kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses, it says. Backyard chickens or pet chickens are at risk if they come in contact with wild birds carrying the virus.

{"id": "424", "title": "Bird Flu Spreads to Cattle, Raising Fears on Farms; Dairy farmers contend with avian-influenza outbreaks thought to be spread by wild birds; no safety risk to milk, agriculture officials say", "date": "2024-04-04", "fulltext": "In the U.S. agriculture industry, bird flu isn't just for birds anymore. An avian-influenza outbreak that has led to the death of about 80 million birds over the past two years is now sickening dairy cattle, temporarily curbing their milk production and prompting some states to increase restrictions on the livestock crossing state lines. Concern that the disease could spread to beef cattle and hurt consumer meat demand has roiled livestock markets. Farmers are ramping up preventive measures, drawing on poultry-industry tactics to drive off wild birds known for spreading the disease. Near Brooten, Minn., dairy farmer Lucas Sjostrom said he is planning more precautions with his 200 dairy cows, such as putting just 3 gallons of raw milk into 5-gallon containers to prevent any splashing or spills while it is hauled away to be pasteurized, which would eliminate any potential viruses. He is considering laser systems that shoo away wild birds, used by some poultry farmers, though he isn't yet sure whether the investment makes sense. \"We just don't know how to battle something so new,\" said Sjostrom, who is also the executive director of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association. \"We're still learning so much.\" The U.S. Agriculture Department over the past two weeks has reported the bird flu in more than a dozen dairy herds in states including Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Michigan and Idaho. No infected dairy cows have died from the malady, according to the USDA, and infections have been limited to older dairy cows that have recovered after mild symptoms. The virus has been detected periodically in other mammals, such as minks, seals and goats. The disease hasn't yet been confirmed in beef cattle. Avian influenza has long threatened the poultry and egg industries, with a nearly 100% mortality rate in chickens. Farms destroy entire flocks after a single case is detected to prevent the disease from spreading. Wild birds, such as ducks and geese, are credited with asymptomatically spreading the disease, which is contagious enough that droppings blown in barn vents can cause an outbreak. The current avian-flu outbreak, the deadliest on record, drove egg prices to records. Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. egg producer, said this week that it detected bird flu at one of its Texas facilities, leading to the death of about two million birds, or nearly 4% of its flock. Analysts expect egg prices to rise as a result. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that a person in Texas tested positive for the disease after being exposed to dairy cattle presumed to be infected. The person reported eye redness, or conjunctivitis, as their only symptom. The human health risk remains low for the general public but people with close, prolonged exposures to infected animals or their environments are at higher risk, the CDC has said. The Texas case was the second known instance that a person in the U.S. has been infected with H5N1 bird flu. The detection of avian influenza in dairy cows has spooked cattle markets over the past week. Futures prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have been volatile after the initial detection and are down this week on fears that the virus will hurt consumer demand for beef or restrict exports, according to analysts. The price that ranchers get for their livestock is down about 4% over the past two weeks, while the prices cattle feeders get from meatpackers are down about 7%, according to FactSet data. So far no bird-flu-related export restrictions have been placed on U.S. red meat or dairy products, according to industry trade groups. Analysts don't expect the disease to affect U.S. consumers' beef or dairy purchasing, because it didn't affect shopping habits for chicken or eggs. Consumers balked at the high prices of eggs, not the disease itself, they said. While infected cows produce less milk, the virus currently isn't expected to affect U.S. milk supplies. It could hurt individual producers' bottom lines as milk prices are low and production costs are rising, said Alan Bjerga, spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, a trade group. The USDA and the Food and Drug Administration said commercial milk supplies are safe because products on store shelves are pasteurized, and dairies must send milk from only healthy animals for processing. The USDA said it hasn't determined whether the disease is moving from cow to cow and so far attributed infections to wild birds. Some industry officials say it could be spreading through raw, unpasteurized milk. The Ohio Department of Agriculture reported a case Wednesday in a dairy-cattle herd that received cows from a Texas dairy in early March. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a trade group for the cattle industry, said it is encouraging beef-cattle producers to limit traffic onto ranches or feedlots and quarantine new animals being introduced to herds. The Meat Institute, a trade association for meatpackers, said a top concern for the industry is protecting workers who might handle infected cattle. Cattlemen are on alert to call their veterinarians if something is amiss with their livestock, such as if an animal's head is down with droopy ears, said Matt Steele, chief executive of the Kansas Cattlemen's Association. Ranchers and feedyard operators, such as southwest Missouri rancher Carl Steiger, are worried that a case being confirmed in beef cattle could dent demand when beef prices are already high in supermarkets. \"So far, knock on wood, that hasn't happened,\" he said.

{"id": "425", "title": "Bird flu pandemic could be '100 times worse' than COVID, scientists warn", "date": "2024-04-04", "fulltext": "A bird flu pandemic with the potential to be '100 times worse than COVID' may be on the horizon after a rare human case was discovered in Texas, experts have warned. The H5N1 avian flu has spread rapidly since a new strain was detected in 2020, affecting wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry and backyard flocks. But it has now even been detected in mammals, with cattle herds across four states becoming infected, and on Monday, federal health officials announced that a dairy worker in Texas caught the virus. 'This virus [has been] on the top of the pandemic list for many, many years and probably decades,' Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, a bird flu researcher from Pittsburgh, said at a recent panel discussing the issue, according to the Daily Mail. 'And now we're getting dangerously close to this virus potentially causing a pandemic.' The H5N1 bird flu is spreading rapidly across mammals and has even infected a dairy worker in Texas. via REUTERS He noted that the H5N1 virus has already been detected in species throughout the world and 'has shown the ability to infect a range of mammalian hosts, including humans.' 'So therefore, in my view, I think this is a virus that has the greatest pandemic threat [that is] playing out in plain sight and globally present,' Kuchipudi said. John Fulton, a pharmaceutical industry consultant for vaccines and the founder of Canada-based BioNiagara who organized the meeting, also expressed his concerns, the Mail reports. 'This appears to be 100 times worse than COVID - or it could be if it mutates and maintains its high case fatality rate,' he said. 'Once it's mutated to infect humans, we can only hope that the [fatality rate] drops.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has maintained that the threat to humans is low. REUTERS Around 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization. For comparison, COVID currently kills less than 0.1% of those it infects - though at the start of the pandemic, the fatality rate was around 20%. Symptoms of the bird flu are similar to those of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people may not develop noticeable symptoms, but others can develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia. The dairy worker in Texas who was infected has reported 'eye redness (consistent with conjunctivitis)' as their only symptom, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted. 'The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with an antiviral drug for [the] flu,' the CDC said. Around 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization. REUTERS The agency and 'the whole U.S. government is taking this situation very seriously,' CDC Director Mandy Cohen told the Washington Post. She maintained that the virus does not pose much of a risk to the general public, noting that the dairy worker was in direct contact with infected cattle, and the US Department of Agriculture has said there are currently no changes that would make it more transmissible to humans. 'While cases among humans in direct contact with infected animals are possible, this indicates that the current risk to the public remains low,' the department said in a statement over the weekend. But the fact that the virus has been found in cattle could mean it is starting to mutate, Cohen told the Washington Post. 'We had not seen avian flu in cattle prior to last week. That is new,' she said. 'It is a reservoir for [the] virus to circulate and potentially change.' If the virus does mutate enough to infect humans, it could spread rapidly, the European Food Safety Authority warned on Wednesday, according to Fox News. 'If avian A [H5N1] influenza viruses acquire the ability to spread efficiently among humans, large-scale transmission could occur due to the lack of immune defenses against H5 viruses in humans,' the Food Safety Authority said. The United States is already testing components used to create a vaccine for the virus. REUTERS To prevent any potential spread, the US is already testing components used to create a vaccine for the virus, and two candidate vaccine viruses appear to be well-matched to protect against H5N1, the Washington Post reports. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also said the Biden administration is monitoring the threat. 'We take the health and safety of the American people seriously,' she said at her briefing on Wednesday. 'It is very important to this president.

{"id": "426", "title": "Is it safe to eat runny eggs amid the bird flu outbreak? Here's what the experts say.", "date": "2024-04-04", "fulltext": "The largest supplier of eggs in the U.S. has stopped production after chickens at one of its Texas plants tested positive for the highly contagious bird flu, the latest in a spike of the cases across the nation. The CDC says that 'the human health risk to the U.S. public from HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) viruses is considered to be low,' according to a news release from the egg supplier, Cal-Maine Foods, which added that 'there is no known risk related to HPAI associated with eggs that are currently in the market and no eggs have been recalled.' The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) explains that HPAI 'cannot be transmitted through safely handled and properly cooked eggs.' But what does that mean exactly? And are over-easy or sunny side up eggs with runny yolk considered properly cooked? Are the risks associated with eating undercooked eggs more severe now? Social media is buzzing with questions. Here's everything you need to know, according to experts. The bird flu and 'properly cooked' eggs 'Safely handled and properly cooked eggs' takes on particular importance as concerns about bird flu grow, said Darin Detwiler, a food safety expert and associate teaching professor of food policy at Northeastern University. 'While H5N1 primarily affects birds, the potential for transmission to humans exists, making it crucial to handle and cook eggs with care to minimize any risk of infection.' To safely handle eggs means to store them in a refrigerator at 40°F or colder as soon as you come home from the grocery store to prevent the growth of bacteria, Detwiler said. You also want to avoid using eggs that are cracked or dirty. And remember to wash your hands, utensils and surfaces with soap and water after they come into contact with raw eggs. Learn more about bird flu: Bird flu outbreak raising concerns about spread. What you need to know. The FDA also recommends keeping raw poultry and eggs separate from other foods to prevent cross-contamination. 'Properly cooked eggs' refers to eggs that are cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F, the CDC says, which is likely to kill disease-causing germs. In other words, over-easy and sunny side up eggs with runny yolk are not considered 'properly cooked,' said Wade Syers, a food safety specialist with Michigan State University Extension. In typical scenarios without bird flu outbreaks to consider, the USDA says that 'everyone is advised against eating raw or undercooked egg yolks, whites or products containing them' namely to avoid food poisoning caused by the bacteria salmonella, which can linger inside eggs and on outer shells. The FDA says to cook eggs until both the yolk and the white are firm; and if you're planning on consuming 'raw or undercooked' eggs, make sure they have been pasteurized, meaning they have been rapidly heated and held at a minimum required temperature for a specified time to destroy bacteria. Are runny eggs safe to eat amid the bird flu outbreak in Texas? Even though Cal-Maine Foods said you shouldn't be concerned about eating contaminated eggs at this time, considering it's the largest supplier of eggs in the U.S., experts advise caution. 'On one hand, I would say that everyone should always be cautious about food safety and not eat runny eggs,' Detwiler said. But 'right now, consumers should definitely be concerned about reputable sources for their food and about proper cooking, handling, refrigeration, etc.' Detwiler concluded: 'In the case of avian flu concerns, eggs should be cooked until both the white and yolk are firm,' which will 'provide an additional layer of safety.' People at higher risk of foodborne illness such as infants, young children, older adults, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems, should be especially careful with runny eggs at this time, said Syers, who agrees that runny eggs should be avoided. That said, the FDA says that the 'likelihood that eggs from infected poultry are found in the retail market is low' because 'of the rapid onset of symptoms in poultry as well as the safeguards in place, which include testing of flocks and federal inspection programs.' And when you properly prepare and store your eggs, the risk is even lower, the FDA says.

{"id": "427", "title": "Is Bird Flu Coming to People Next? Are We Ready?", "date": "2024-04-05", "fulltext": "Unlike the coronavirus, the H5N1 virus has been studied for years. Vaccines and treatments are available should they ever become necessary. Bird flu outbreaks among dairy cows in multiple states, and at least one infection in a farmworker in Texas, have incited fears that the virus may be the next infectious threat to people. The influenza virus, called H5N1, is highly pathogenic, meaning it has the ability to cause severe disease and death. But while its spread among cows was unexpected, people can catch the virus only from close contact with infected animals, not from one another, federal officials said. 'It's really about folks who are in environments where they may be interacting with cattle that are infected with this virus,' said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 'The risk for most everyone else is very low,' he added. 'Right now, our risk assessment hasn't changed, but if it does change, we're going be pretty quick and pretty transparent about that.' Avian influenza is often fatal in birds, but none of the infected cows have died so far. The only symptom in the patient in Texas was conjunctivitis, or pink eye, which was also reported in people infected during other bird flu outbreaks. The C.D.C. and other agencies in the United States and elsewhere have tracked H5N1 for years to monitor its evolution. Federal agencies have stockpiled vaccines and drugs to be used in a possible bird flu outbreak. 'We are more ready for an influenza pandemic than probably any other outbreak that could occur, any other pathogen,' said Rick Bright, the chief executive of Bright Global Health, a consulting company that focuses on improving responses to public health emergencies. Dr. Bright led influenza preparedness at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, the federal agency that supports research on vaccines and drugs for emergencies, for several years before he served as the agency's director from 2016 to 2020. Here's what you need to know about the H5N1 virus: Is a human pandemic inevitable? Among birds and animals, the H5N1 bird flu is already a pandemic, or a panzootic, with infections observed on every continent except Australia. To date, the virus has not evolved into a form that can spread easily from one person to another, and it may never do so. As its name indicates, H5N1 has primarily been a problem in birds. But it has now spread to a wide range of species, from sea birds and small scavengers like foxes to large mammals, like bears and cows. There have been sporadic infections in people since 1997, when a cluster of cases appeared in Hong Kong. But most patients worldwide have been in very close contact with infected animals, and generally they did not pass the virus to other people. To become adept at transmission between people, H5N1 would need to pick up several additional mutations and shift its shape. The strain that was isolated from the infected farmworker in Texas carries one of those mutations, but that change has appeared before in people, foxes and seals, among others, without further consequences. The infections in people so far 'fortunately are all still single-time cross-species transmission,' said Vincent Munster, a virologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has studied the mutations needed for H5N1 to adapt to people. History suggests that even if the virus changes enough to begin widespread transmission between people, it may have to give something up in return, Dr. Munster said. For example, when other flu viruses have adapted to humans, they have lost much of their virulence, causing only mild symptoms. How will we know if the virus spreads to people? H5N1 is an influenza virus that is followed by extensive scientific networks that track flu viruses worldwide. 'We've got our eye on it, and we've had our eye on it for years,' Dr. Daskalakis said. These surveillance networks tracked H5N1 even before its surge in birds and animals over the past two years. Now they are on high alert. Scientists are watching for mutations that could make H5N1 more likely to infect people or resistant to the vaccines and drugs available to counter it. The World Health Organization, the C.D.C. and other global health organizations routinely share information and genetic sequences to monitor which flu strains are spreading and where. In the current outbreak, the Department of Agriculture has shared genetic sequences from infected cows with the C.D.C., which analyzes the sequences and ensures that the stockpiled vaccines and drugs are still effective. Do we have a vaccine for bird flu? Yes. BARDA has enough building blocks for vaccines, including adjuvants, substances that can enhance a vaccine's strength, to make millions of doses in weeks. Mass production could also ramp up quickly if needed, federal officials said. The C.D.C. already has two candidate viruses that can be used to make vaccines. As the virus changes, gaining mutations that make it resistant to the current vaccines and drugs, for example, federal researchers may create newer candidates. Three pharmaceutical companies can be called on to make vaccines for bird flu, but those vaccines would be manufactured on the same production lines that are used to make seasonal flu vaccines. Before embarking on large-scale manufacturing, federal officials would have to consider the implications of disrupting seasonal production, said David Boucher, the infectious disease director at the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. The pharmaceutical companies don't all use egg-based methods to produce vaccines, an important consideration because of the potential for bird flu outbreaks to derail the nation's egg supply. BARDA is also looking to add mRNA to the list of technologies that can be used to make bird flu vaccines. (The Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna relied on the method.) What about treatments? At least four antiviral medications are available to treat people who may become sick with bird flu, including the widely available generic drug oseltamivir, sometimes marketed as Tamiflu. Unlike the vaccines, which are stockpiled by the federal government, the antiviral drugs are available commercially. Generic versions of oseltamivir are made by many manufacturers worldwide. The federal government has a stockpile of tens of millions of doses of oseltamivir, Dr. Boucher said. The government is in close communication with manufacturers that could quickly ramp up the production of oseltamivir, as it has in the past during some bad flu seasons. All of these preparations are in place for a worst-case scenario, but 'we're not there yet,' Dr. Boucher said. 'Our job here is to prepare for the worst and get ready for it in case it does come.'", "media_outlet": "NYTimes", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "Bird flu outbreaks among dairy cows in multiple states, and at least one infection in a farmworker in Texas, have incited fears that the virus may be the next infectious threat to people.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "The C.D.C. and other agencies in the United States and elsewhere have tracked H5N1 for years to monitor its evolution.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_5": "History suggests that even if the virus changes enough to begin widespread transmission between people, it may have to give something up in return, Dr. Munster said.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_7": "As the virus changes, gaining mutations that make it resistant to the current vaccines and drugs, for example, federal researchers may create newer candidates.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 4, "affirm_why_statement_1": "To become adept at transmission between people, H5N1 would need to pick up several additional mutations and shift its shape.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "The strain that was isolated from the infected farmworker in Texas carries one of those mutations, but that change has appeared before in people, foxes and seals, among others, without further consequences.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "Scientists are watching for mutations that could make H5N1 more likely to infect people or resistant to the vaccines and drugs available to counter it.", "affirm_why_count": 3, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "Unlike the coronavirus, the H5N1 virus has been studied for years.", "affirm_keywords_statement_2": "'We are more ready for an influenza pandemic than probably any other outbreak that could occur, any other pathogen,' said Rick Bright, the chief executive of Bright Global Health, a consulting company that focuses on improving responses to public health emergencies.", "affirm_keywords_statement_3": "Among birds and animals, the H5N1 bird flu is already a pandemic, or a panzootic, with infections observed on every continent except Australia.", "affirm_keywords_statement_4": "BARDA is also looking to add mRNA to the list of technologies that can be used to make bird flu vaccines.

{"id": "428", "title": "Can You Get Bird Flu From Milk and Eggs?", "date": "2024-04-05", "fulltext": "Here's what we know and don't know about the risk the virus poses in food. A strain of avian influenza that has killed millions of birds in recent years has now been detected in dairy cows in several states, prompting concerns about the safety of the U.S. dairy supply. Federal health and agriculture officials released a statement last week stressing that there continues to be no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply, while underscoring that the agencies are continuing to monitor the situation as it evolves. Scientists know that bird flu can spread to humans when they come into contact with infected animals, including dead ones, without wearing protective gear, which seems to have been the case with a person recently infected in Texas. So far, there isn't any evidence to suggest that humans can contract bird flu by consuming food that has been pasteurized or cooked, said Benjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University. \"That's not to say it couldn't happen,\" he said. \"It's just that we have a pretty robust history of it not happening. And that's good news.\" However, there are a few key points that researchers are still working to understand, Dr. Chapman and other experts said, like just how widespread the current outbreak is in cows, or exactly how the virus spread to them. Public safety agencies have said that it's not clear what risks surround unpasteurized products. \"In the column of known versus unknown, there's a lot more in the unknown part,\" said Dr. Gail Hansen, a veterinary public health expert and independent public health consultant. What do we know about bird flu and dairy products? Avian flu was detected in unpasteurized milk samples from sick cows last month, but the Food and Drug Administration has said that the commercial supply of pasteurized milk remains safe and that it does not currently have concerns about pasteurized cheese. Milk from sick cows is being diverted or destroyed so it does not end up on store shelves. The pasteurization process, which works by heating milk to destroy pathogens, will kill influenza, said Matthew Moore, an assistant professor in the department of food science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Raw or unpasteurized milk, which has become increasingly accessible in the United States over the last decade, already puts people at a higher risk from harmful germs. \"Now there's a whole new level of concern,\" said Darin Detwiler, a food safety expert and professor at Northeastern University's College of Professional Studies. \"I don't think that one can make an argument that we shouldn't be concerned about drinking raw milk in this era.\" The F.D.A. said that it does not yet know whether people can contract avian flu by consuming raw milk and cheese products made from infected cows. The agency recommended that manufacturers refrain from making raw milk or raw milk cheese from cows that show symptoms. What about meat? The confirmed cases so far have been in dairy cows, not those used for meat, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it is confident that the meat supply is safe. The agriculture industry has safeguards to identify and quarantine sick animals so that they do not end up in the food or dairy supply. Scientists are still trying to figure out if cows shed the virus before they are symptomatic; if they do, it could raise new concerns. But proper cooking would render the virus harmless, said Aljoša Trmcˇicˇ, a dairy safety expert at the Cornell College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. The same precautions that prevent people from getting sick from pathogens such as salmonella can help prevent contamination with the virus, Dr. Chapman said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends four simple steps: frequently clean your hands and the surfaces you use to prep food with soap and water; keep raw meat, poultry, fish and juices separate from other foods; use a food thermometer to ensure you've cooked food to the right temperature; and do not leave food at room temperature for more than two hours, or for more than one hour when the temperature is above 90 degrees. \"All the precautions that you would normally take for just sensible handling of raw meat would be good enough,\" Dr. Moore said. Are eggs safe to eat? Cal-Maine Foods, a major producer of eggs in the United States, announced this week that it had detected avian flu in a Texas facility and culled over one million birds. Infected hens most likely will lay eggs that are also infected with the virus, Dr. Trmcˇicˇ said, but he added that it's very unlikely for a contaminated egg to make it onto the market with the industry controls in place. Egg products like liquid egg whites are pasteurized. But most whole eggs sold in cartons are not pasteurized on the inside, Dr. Trmcˇicˇ said. You need to properly cook them to kill pathogens like avian flu, but also more common germs like salmonella. That includes making sure both yolks and whites are firm, not runny. You may also want to avoid dough, sauces, drinks or other items that use raw or undercooked eggs, Dr. Detwiler said. \"I'm not saying avoid eating eggs or avoid drinking milk,\" Dr. Detwiler said. \"Go forward with caution, and think about how some practices may have more risk than others.\"", "media_outlet": "NYTimes", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "\"That's not to say it couldn't happen,\" he said. \"It's just that we have a pretty robust history of it not happening.

{"id": "429", "title": "Why a leading bird flu expert isn�t convinced that the risk H5N1 poses to people has declined", "date": "2024-04-05", "fulltext": "News that H5N1 avian influenza has breached another mammalian species—this time dairy cows—has taken the flu science community aback. Though cows previously had been seen to be susceptible to human flu viruses, and could be experimentally infected with H5 in a lab, the absence of cow involvement until now in H5's nearly 30-year history lulled scientists into thinking the species was outside the virus's remit. Further elevating the concern this discovery has triggered is the fact that a dairy farm worker in Texas was infected with H5N1, though the unnamed individual's only symptom was conjunctivitis. To put these developments in perspective, STAT turned to Dutch virologist Ron Fouchier, a leading expert on H5N1, for his assessment of these latest twists in the H5 saga. Fouchier, who studies avian influenza at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, was at the center of a controversy about H5N1 in 2012, when a U.S. scientific advisory group moved to restrict publication of research he and a team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison had done separately to see what mutations would be needed for the virus to be able to spread efficiently among people, so-called gain of function research. Fouchier takes little solace from the fact that current versions of H5N1 seem to infect people less frequently, and to cause mostly mild illness when they do. The global range of H5 viruses, the sheer volume of the virus in nature, and the numbers of mammals H5 has shown itself capable of sickening is unprecedented, he said, making anticipating its future path harder than ever to gauge. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy A transcript of the conversation is below. It has been lightly edited for length and clarity. (Note: A zoonosis or zoonotic event is the infection of a person with an animal virus, in this case H5N1. Reassortment is a process by which flu viruses swap genes in an infected species, giving rise to hybrid viruses that could behave differently than their parent viruses.) Is it possible that we’ve seen the H5N1 evolve to become more dangerous to a bunch of other species, but less dangerous to us? It’s what I’d like to think. In the years after the first human cases of infections in Hong Kong in 1997 right up to 2015, we saw relatively large numbers of zoonotic events with H5N1, ending in 2015, with very large numbers in Egypt. There were quite large numbers of human cases, despite restricted replication of the virus around the globe. Then, from 2014 onwards, the virus really started to spread massively with wild birds into Europe, crossing over into the U.S. two times now, also landing in Africa, spreading throughout Asia, all in wild migratory birds. We’ve never seen such big outbreaks all across Europe and the Americas. And we see the number of zoonotic events decrease. Related: What we know about H5N1 bird flu in cows and the risk to humans You have massive outbreaks in wild birds. It spreads over into poultry quite easily. But in humans we see lower numbers, and that to me suggests that the zoonotic risk has decreased. And I am more or less supported by that by noticing that in the Western world in England, in Russia, and in the U.S. most of the [human] cases that we have seen were not particularly severe. After 2015, one thing that has happened is that these H5 viruses have continuously reassorted with wild bird avian influenza viruses. So what I think has happened is that these viruses are now better adapted to wild birds, but less adapted to poultry and to humans. That increases the environmental load of virus on occasion. There’s different species, time and time again, where you see massive bursts of virus. And carnivores, they feast on [dead birds]. It could also increase the environmental virus load on grasslands where birds poop or in surface waters. And that could increase the risk even to non-carnivorous mammals like goats or cows. That kind of gives me a feeling of reassurance. It just provides an explanation where you wouldn’t have to really take into account yet an increased zoonotic risk. Of course, when we see this virus in a milking farm and you see incredibly high virus load in some milk cows and their milk, that is a new risk. Because I’m not sure how familiar you are with the milking procedures, but there’s very little that people do to prevent human contact with milk. During the milking process, there’s massive generation of aerosol formation. If you have high amounts of aerosol with virus, the chances increase that you will get conjunctivitis. There’s very little hygiene to protect the farmers that are milking. If people aren’t washing their hands a lot and somebody’s infected with conjunctivitis, you could see how that could spread, couldn’t you? When we had an outbreak of [H7N7] bird flu in the Netherlands in 2003, we had 89 cases of human infection. Is that when a veterinarian died? Yes. The majority of cases then were conjunctivitis cases. There were very few respiratory illnesses, except for that one fatal case. But the cases of conjunctivitis were linked to direct contact with poultry, and not with human-to-human transmission. There was only one investigation where two household members got conjunctivitis, and they shared a towel to wash their face. I think it is not very likely that you will see massive spread of conjunctivitis due to avian influenza. I don’t think that it’s likely that it will spread human to human. It’s more likely that it will spread from the animal source into humans. I think you disagreed earlier when I used the word “reassuring.” But to me this pattern of becoming much better at infecting wild birds, and seemingly less inclined to infect people seems reassuring. Well, let me explain why I don’t think it’s too reassuring. We have never seen this scale of infections in mammals, and in such diversity of mammals. We have now seen more than 40 species of mammals infected during the last outbreaks, which is unprecedented. We know that flu is unpredictable. But we also know that adaptation of virus to mammals is not a good thing. Related: H5N1 avian flu found in Texas individual who apparently was infected by dairy cows Many of the adaptive mutations that you see occur when H5 has infected marine mammals, or foxes or martens or minks have been seen with the viruses that caused previous human pandemics. And that I find not reassuring. And with 40 species happening at the same time all over the world, sometimes with little option to intervene, that is not so reassuring to me. What do you mean by options to intervene? Well, if there are infections in cows, we can offer personal protective equipment to the milkers and we can offer antiviral drugs to people who start to develop symptoms or conjunctivitis. But when tens of thousands of seals wash up on your shore, what are you going to do? And how are you going to prevent onward spread? And these are the animals that we see. What about the animals that we don’t see so easily, like rats or mice? What’s happening? The large species we now know get infected easily. But the small species, we don’t even know. And so the high presence in nature, and the large number of infections I find concerning, despite the fact that we think current zoonotic risk is low. And that’s because these viruses are changing. And we have no experience [of how H5 behaves] in all these species. We can’t predict what’s going to happen. One of the things H5 has taught me is that it’s ever-changing, and just because it seems to infect people less frequently right now, that doesn’t mean it’s always going to be that way. Also the fact that the first human now is diagnosed with conjunctivitis is not a guarantee. There’s a small chance that if you have an infection in the eye, that you will actually get virus also in your respiratory tract. And then we know that if the virus ends up in your lower airways, you could develop pneumonia. One case in a farmer who only develops conjunctivitis is not a reason to celebrate the fact that this virus is not virulent. Let’s be careful now, and monitor the people and treat them with drugs as soon as you see that there’s something more happening. What are you working on now? What are you looking for? I would like to know if there is indeed decreased zoonotic risk through the reassortment patterns. How do you investigate that question? We identified reassortment patterns. And then we take one of the earlier parental viruses that didn’t spread so well in wild birds and compare it to the current versions and inoculate different bird species, including ducks, or cell cultures. And you can look for all of the different variants, and how they vary in their replicative capacity in wild birds. We can inoculate human organoid cells and see how permissive the cells are to the different variants, whether the early Asian variants that caused many zoonoses, whether they were, in fact, more prone to infect human tissue than the current viruses. And if you see those same opposing patterns so more adaptation to wild birds, less efficient in infecting human cells that would explain the current situation compared to what we’ve seen before. But of course, it’s important to note that we’re all doing our research with our hands tied behind our back because of the gain-of-function issues. We have to be careful in what we do and how we design the experiments. So we can take natural viruses and show that the old viruses were less likely to infect wild birds and more likely to infect human cells, and the current virus is the other way around. But really getting to the bottom of things is getting harder and harder. Is there anything you’ve been waiting for a chance to say but I haven’t asked the right question to elicit it? Well, the questions are really about what’s going on with the cows. And U.S. scientists and officials are hopefully going to resolve that quickly. How does this virus enter cows? If there is cow-to-cow transmission, how does it work? It’s clear that it’s dairy cows, and it could be that it’s due to the milking instruments that do not get cleaned enough. It’s human driven cow-to-cow transmission. And if that’s the case, you can stop it. You can try to actually clean your machine. So I’m really looking forward to in-depth investigations, epidemiological investigations of how the cows get this disease. It could also be from a common feeding source. So what are these cows being fed? Do they eat fresh grass? Do they eat hay from a common source that has been contaminated by birds being out there? I think this is really crucial information, because this is going to lead to what are the options to stop this outbreak.", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "Fouchier, who studies avian influenza at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, was at the center of a controversy about H5N1 in 2012, when a U.S. scientific advisory group moved to restrict publication of research he and a team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison had done separately to see what mutations would be needed for the virus to be able to spread efficiently among people, so-called gain of function research.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_3": "We know that flu is unpredictable.

{"id": "430", "title": "CDC to doctors: Look out for bird flu infections among dairy farm workers", "date": "2024-04-05", "fulltext": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged medical practitioners on Friday to be on the lookout for people who might have contracted H5N1 bird flu from cows. The agency also urged state health departments to rapidly assess any suspected human cases, and recommended that dairy farms with confirmed or suspected outbreaks require workers to use personal protective equipment. The recommendations were outlined in a health alert network advisory, or HAN in CDC parlance. The advisory is in response to the outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in at least 16 dairy herds in six states across the country, which has led to at least one human infection so far. Health care providers should ask themselves 'Could this be an H5N1 infection?' if they are faced with a patient with what CDC called a relevant exposure history for instance, someone who works with dairy cows or lives with someone who works with dairy cows. The illness should be considered for a range of mild, medium, and severe symptoms, from conjunctivitis to fever, shortness of breath, or pneumonia and/or organ failure, the CDC said. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy Any patient suspected of having H5N1 flu should be isolated and cared for by medical professionals wearing protective equipment. Suspected cases should be started on the flu drug oseltamivir sold as Tamiflu even before test results confirming the infection have come back, the agency said. The CDC said the individual known to have been infected, who worked on a dairy farm in Texas, is recovering from very mild symptoms effectively only conjunctivitis, sometimes called pink eye. The individual was treated with oseltamivir, as were people who had been in contact with that individual before the diagnosis. So far, there is no indication of secondary spread from this person. 'No additional cases of human infection with HPAI A(H5N1) virus associated with the current infections in dairy cattle and birds in the United States, and no human-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) virus have been identified,' the CDC advisory said. Related: Why a leading bird flu expert isn’t convinced that the risk H5N1 poses to people has declined HPAI is shorthand for highly pathogenic avian influenza, a term that describes how a flu virus behaves when it infects poultry. H5N1 viruses, which have been circulating on and off since 1997, decimate poultry flocks. In cows, however, the illness has been mild to date, with infected animals showing a decline in milk production and decreased feed consumption. Dairy operations have been instructed to destroy milk from infected animals; milk from infected animals has been found to contain H5N1 viruses. Even if contaminated milk were to make its way into the human food chain, pasteurization would destroy the viruses, the Food and Drug Administration has said. Consumption of raw milk or raw milk cheese from infected cows could pose a health risk and should be avoided, the CDC said. Infected cows have been reported from Texas (eight herds), Kansas (three), New Mexico (two), and Idaho, Michigan, and Ohio (one apiece). Trending Now: Why a leading bird flu expert isn’t convinced that the risk H5N1 poses to people has declined It is unclear if the virus has been transmitting from cow-to-cow through the respiratory route, in the way human flu spreads, or whether some aspect of dairy operations the movement of cattle from winter grazing grounds back to northern states, a lack of cleaning of milking equipment as it is moved from cow to cow is fueling spread of the virus. The CDC’s advisory said that analyses of viruses taken from the infected person, from cows, and from wild birds and poultry showed only small genetic changes.

{"id": "431", "title": "How dangerous is the bird flu outbreak? Here's what I'm telling my patients.", "date": "2024-04-05", "fulltext": "I have tracked deadly, massive outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry for the past two decades. Hundreds of millions of birds have died, and there has been frequent spillover to other species, including mink, seals, foxes, skunks and even dogs and cats. This week, the nation's largest supplier of eggs stopped production after birds at a plant in Texas tested positive. About 2 million chickens were slaughtered to prevent spread of the illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that a person in Texas had contracted the flu but is displaying only mild symptoms. The public has worried at times about a massive human pandemic, but since 2005, the structure of the bird flu virus has not changed significantly. That is extremely good news, especially when you consider that gain-of-function research conducted in Dr. Ron Fouchier's lab in the Netherlands in 2011 revealed the mutations needed for bird flu to pass from human to human. Monitoring of the virus in nature has shown that those mutations have yet to occur. I spoke this week with CDC Director Mandy Cohen, who told me that the current spillover of bird flu to cattle has not shown any significant genetic changes. That is also good news. The outbreak has occurred only in a few states (Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas), but cattle are brought from state to state and could have picked up the virus from birds. Dr. Cohen told me that the cattle have shown mild upper respiratory symptoms. Can you import prescriptions? Florida can now import prescription drugs from Canada. It's great news to my patients. Person with bird flu experienced mild symptoms The patient in Texas also had mild symptoms—conjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms. She said the man was treated with Tamiflu and quickly got better. People in close contact with him also were given Tamiflu, as a precaution against further spread. Click to view image. Dr. Cohen said there is potential for cattle to become the first mammals to become a reservoir of the bird flu. The CDC is working closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track cattle that have or have been exposed to the illness to determine if there is any sustained spread. Over the past two decades, more than 400 million birds either have died from the disease or been culled to prevent transmission. Yet, human cases remain rare, with only 2,634 cases and about 1,000 deaths. Bird flu pandemic? Experts look at worst-case scenarios. Don't get me wrong: It is the potential for the virus to adapt to human transmission over time that keeps many scientists and public health specialists up at night. But far too often, those experts are looking at worst-case scenarios to the detriment of public perception. Fear is at the heart of public and media reactions to the potential of bird flu and other viruses to become a much-deadlier threat to humans. Your doctor might not listen to you. AI can help change that. David Nabarro, a senior World Health Organizations expert on infectious diseases, warned the public in 2005 that up to 150 million people could die of bird flu. And though his prediction was far from reality, it was taken seriously at the time. Since then, there have been intermittent flare-ups of public fears, stoked by the idea that bird flu will become the WHO's so-called Disease X, a virus with a high death rate that spreads easily and quickly.

That is not only reassuring now but also is likely to continue to be the case. The greater danger remains the fear of the virus rather than the virus itself. But there is one major caveat. The road map, developed by Dr. Fouchier, for a mutation deadly to humans could end up in the wrong hands. And that risk is enough to keep everyone up at night. Click to view image.

Today's top stories Even scientists who have tracked the avian influenza for years are confused by its recent spread in dairy cattle populations. \"There's a heap of unknowns right now,\" says Richard Webby, a virologist at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. What we do know is that the first cases of this H5N1 bird flu strain emerged among migratory birds in late 2021, and is now showing up among dairy cows and at a major egg producer in Mississippi. One person who had close contact with cows presumed to be infected with the virus has caught the virus. * Federal officials and scientists stress the risk to the public remains low, despite reports that the strain is affecting new wild bird species and persisting longer than previous ones. There are no documented cases of human to human transmission, and it's generally rare for people to catch any type of bird flu. \"The good news is this is not a serious problem,\" Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller told NPR. \"It's not going to bankrupt anybody. Cows basically have the flu for a week, and they get over it.\" The USDA has also said that the dairy supply remains safe and no recall is needed because only milk from healthy cows can be processed for human consumption.

Polling in Israel shows two things: 1) Israelis overwhelmingly support the Israeli government's war on Hamas and 2) Israelis overwhelmingly disapprove of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Benny Gantz, who is a part of the prime minister's war cabinet, is the leader of the opposition party in Israel. He's called for the government to agree on a date for elections. Polls show that Gantz would win against Netanyahu in an election. * Gantz was brought in as a kind of moderating influence in the country's war cabinet, NPR's Jennifer Ludden explains on Up First. The retired general and former chief of the military general staff was able to instill public trust in Netanyahu's cabinet. Even before these recent calls for a new election, the prime minister has said that elections would paralyze the country for months and stall negotiations for the release of more than a 100 hostages still in Gaza. Ludden adds that a lot of Israelis hold Netanyahu personally responsible for failing to anticipate the Hamas attack which Israel says killed 1,200 people. Israel's military response has now killed more than 32,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry. * Orthodox Jews in full time religious study are exempt from military service, which is infuriating for many Israelis, according to Ludden. But ultra religious parties are a key part of Netanyahu's government coalition, and he has yet to challenge this exemption. NATO is celebrating its 75th anniversary today. The alliance has nearly tripled in size since it was founded after WWII. One of the newest members, Sweden, is attending its first meeting today as a full member. * Russia's war on Ukraine has thrust NATO back into relevance, NPR's Teri Schultz explains on Up First. Just look at the two countries that have recently joined NATO — Finland and Sweden. They might have remained neutral or militarily non-aligned if Russia hadn't launched a full scale invasion on Ukraine two years ago. Ukraine isn't at today's meeting. NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has proposed a new five-year plan in which NATO would assume coordination of international weapons deliveries from the U.S. They hope to have this deal hammered out by July, but Ukraine will still not be getting what it really wants — to be the 33rd member of the alliance. Deep dive First responders mitigated a lot of the damage that could have been caused by the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore on March 26. NPR's Investigations Team analyzed more than 1,000 radio messages exchanged between the state and city police agencies and the fire department on the day of the collapse. * At 1:27 a.m., when a pilot onboard the container ship Dali issued a call saying the ship had lost power near the bridge, first responders jumped on the radio channels. The same minute, officers had been alerted to prevent cars from crossing. * The first responder then thought to alert the construction workers but seconds later the ship hit the bridge. Another first responder then called for backup to save the crew — at 1:29 a.m. — but by then the bridge was gone. * That's when the rescue operation began, and first responders tried to confirm how many construction workers were missing. The workers who fell in the water were from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. The messages on the radio show there was a communication difficulty with other crew members who were trying to help with rescue efforts. \"Probably the language barrier,\" said one of the first responders. * Just after 2 a.m., someone spotted something in the water. Fifteen minutes later there were reports of someone receiving medical attention. By early morning, rescuers had pulled two people out of the river alive. Life advice Do you ever find yourself staring at a screen that says \"select your tip\" and have no clue what to do? Well you're not the only one. Tipping is confusing these days, especially when businesses that never asked for tips start asking for them. Tipping expectations have also grown over the last few years, according to a Pew Research survey. It's easier for companies to ask for tips, thanks to electronic payment software like Square. Here are some things to keep in mind the next time you're perplexed by a tip screen: * Location matters. Depending on your state's minimum wage, your server might be expecting a tip. Finding out the local minimum can help you decide how much to leave/tip. * When in doubt, just ask. Sometimes, it's not clear how much of your tip is going to your barista or waitress. You can always ask them if they are getting all of your tip. * Dealing with unexpected tip requests. Watch out for \"screen pressure\" — that's when businesses load up their payment systems with high default minimum payment options. Before you go * Dr. Thaer Ahmad, a Palestinian American doctor, walked out of a meeting with President Biden on Tuesday. The meeting with a small group of Muslims was held after the administration canceled a scaled down Ramadan event. * Virginia may become the 12th state in the U.S. to ban marriage for minors.

{"id": "433", "title": "Avian Flu and the Experts Who Cried Wolf; If Americans don't line up for jabs, the public-health establishment will have itself to blame.", "date": "2024-04-07", "fulltext": "A bird-flu pandemic could be 100 times worse than Covid, media outlets warn, citing experts. Readers roll their eyes, and for good reason. The press profits from scaring the public, as does the public-health industry. Covid-19 spurred governments to spend heavily on public-health systems. Yet should another pandemic occur, the U.S. will be in a far worse position to respond to it than it was four years ago. No amount of spending on vaccines and virus surveillance can compensate for the public trust health experts have squandered. Scientists for decades predicted that a pandemic could arise if a virus spills over from animals to humans. Covid's emergence seemed to validate that. The novel coronavirus was nearly identical to a virus found in bats, though it included some genetic oddities that made it more transmissible among humans. Further research suggested that these oddities, especially a furin cleavage site, likely resulted from gain-of-function experiments by Chinese scientists that accelerated its adaptation to humans. Experts such as Anthony Fauci dismissed this hypothesis as a conspiracy theory. Many refused to wrestle with the evidence and ridiculed scientists with unorthodox views on the virus's origins, as well as on lockdowns, school closures and masks. Even when their shibboleths proved harmful, they stuck to them. Can Americans be blamed for doubting experts who now say that the avian flu could pose a great threat to the public, but that the government is well-prepared? It isn't impossible that the H5N1 avian flu, which has transmitted from wild birds to chickens and has been found in cattle, mountain lions and raccoons, could mutate and spread among humans. But it isn't likely. First identified in Chinese geese in 1996, H5N1 has caused periodic outbreaks among chickens, as well as humans and animals directly exposed to them. There have been 888 documented human cases in 23 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. This is likely an underestimate, since people with mild symptoms might not have been checked. A recently infected Texas man, exposed to the virus from sick cattle, developed mild symptoms such as red eyes. This would suggest that the WHO's estimate that the virus is fatal in 50% or more cases is inflated. The same was true of Covid, which even before the vaccine became available was nearly 90% less deadly than scientists initially estimated. Biden administration officials say that avian flu vaccines have already been developed and could be rapidly manufactured. But don't be surprised if Americans don't line up to get them. Public-health experts blame antivaxxers for sowing distrust in jabs. But four years ago, these same people, along with the press, fueled skepticism about the Trump administration's efforts to develop a vaccine. During the summer and autumn of 2020, they warned that the president was in a dangerous rush. Washington Post reporters on June 1, 2020, warned that scientists fear regulators could come under pressure to approve a vaccine before it is fully vetted for safety and effectiveness. On Sept. 4, 2020, the newspaper published an op-ed claiming that Trump's rush for a Covid vaccine could make it less likely to work. The piece warned that past might be prologue, noting the swine-flu vaccine in 1976 meant to help President Gerald Ford's election campaign not only proved ineffective but also afflicted hundreds with a paralyzing side effect. The history of vaccines is full of alarming missteps, warned medical analyst Kent Sepkowitz at CNN.com on Sept. 10. The current rush to vaccination, he opined, is most reminiscent of a Lyme disease vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998, which was later pulled from the market after complaints about painful side effects spurred lawsuits. On Sept. 22, 2020, the Washington Post published another op-ed, by former Harvard Medical School professor William Haseltine, warning that rushed Moderna and Pfizer trials could bring about similar short-term health consequences or, potentially far worse, lead to long-term health consequences that we won't discover until months or years after the vaccine's approval. Democratic politicians including Kamala Harris also suggested that the FDA was politically pliable and that Covid vaccines couldn't be trusted. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he wanted state health officials to review the vaccine. The first question is, is the vaccine safe? Frankly, I'm not going to trust the federal government's opinion. According to the Pew Research Center, the share of Americans who said they would probably or definitely get the Covid vaccine plunged to 51% in September 2020 from 72% that May, with an equal reduction among members of both political parties. The public-health clerisy accuses conservatives of fomenting distrust in science and vaccines. They might look in the mirror.

{"id": "434", "title": "Can cats get bird flu? How to protect them and what else to know amid the outbreak", "date": "2024-04-08", "fulltext": "Officials are continuing to investigate a recent bird flu outbreak following reports of one human case and infections in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas. In late March, officials reported cows infected with bird flu, or avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, in the two states. The following week, Texas confirmed the state's first known infection in a person. The April 1 announcement from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the only symptom the Texas patient experienced was conjunctivitis, or pink eye. The CDC still has the current health risk of bird flu listed as 'low.' Researchers investigating the dairy farm infections in Texas did discover, however, that cows and one human were not the only mammalian victims of the recent outbreak: three cats found dead at the facilities prompted some further investigation into the spread. Bird flu is primarily considered a transmission risk between wild birds and domestic birds; the recent presence of bird flu in dairy cows in Kansas and Texas is believed to be a first for the species. Researchers at Cornell University believe the affected Texas dairy cows were infected via water and food sources contaminated by wild birds migrating through the area. It was then likely spread between cows in close quarters, though that's not yet a definitive conclusion. Dr. Elisha Frye, an assistant professor of practice at Cornell's Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, was called to the affected dairy farm in March to investigate the deaths of cows, birds and cats at the facility. Frye determined the presence of the illness in the cows using milk samples, manure and nasal swabs. Testing was also done on dead birds found on the farm, as well as one of three cats found dead at the facilities around the same time. All the tests turned up evidence of the presence of bird flu. 'It was kind of the same timeline as when we found it in the cattle samples, but it did kind of link it together,' Frye previously told USA TODAY. 'The birds, the cat and milk from the cows all having the same pathogen in them made sense at the time for that being the main cause of illness.' Have cats been affected by bird flu in the past? The CDC has records of sporadic mammalian outbreaks of the bird flu in the past, impacting both wild animals like foxes and bears, as well as pets like dogs and cats. Officials believe these cases are caused by the animals consuming infected birds and poultry. In 2004, an outbreak in domestic animals including cats and dogs was reported in Thailand, and another outbreak impacting pets occurred in Germany and North America in 2006. The organization says humans contracting the virus from their pets is very rare and unlikely but has happened as a result of prolonged, unprotected exposure. In 2016, a veterinarian in New York City contracted bird flu from repeated exposure to sick cats without protective gear. The vet suffered mild flu symptoms. Signs your pet may be sick The likelihood of your cat contracting bird flu is minimal. However, it can happen if your cat is often outside and ends up eating or getting too cozy with an infected bird, or hangs out in a contaminated environment. If you suspect people or animals in your home have been around a sick or dead bird, you should monitor them closely for these signs: * Fever or feeling feverish/chills * Cough * Sore throat * Difficulty breathing/shortness of breath * Conjunctivitis (eye tearing, redness, irritation, or discharge from eye) * Headaches * Runny or stuffy nose * Muscle or body aches * Diarrhea Click to view image. How to prevent the spread of bird flu Avoiding exposure in the first place is the most effective way to stop the spread, says the CDC. * Avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe wild birds only from a distance, whenever possible. * Avoid contact between pets (e.g., pet birds, dogs and cats) with wild birds * Don't touch sick or dead birds, their feces or litter or any surface or water source (e.g., ponds, waterers, buckets, pans, troughs) that might be contaminated with their saliva, feces, or any other bodily fluids without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). * Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes after contact with birds or surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from wild or domestic birds. * Wash your hands with soap and water after touching birds or other sick animals. * Change your clothes after contact with wild birds, poultry and sick animals. Cats are capable of catching bird flu from sick birds, say experts.

{"id": "435", "title": "As bird flu spreads, the Biden admin remains dangerously unprepared for another pandemic", "date": "2024-04-09", "fulltext": "The H5N1 virus — which for 30 years affected mostly birds — is rapidly evolving and spreading globally. The Biden administration is dangerously unready. Over the last two years, H5N1 has jumped from birds to mammals, sickening some 30 species. South American scientists publishing in the prestigious journal Nature report massive 'sea lion die-offs' and warn about 'mutations of concern' potentially evolving into the next global pandemic. Here in the United States, dairy cows, never before vulnerable to bird flu, are infected in six states. Is the public in danger? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk is 'low' but is advising states to be ready with rapid tests. In the United States, only two human cases have been reported. Neither person died. But nearly 1,000 people in other parts of the world have contracted the virus — almost always from touching a sick or dead bird or bird feces. Half died. Some food-safety experts caution against eating runny egg yolks, cheeses made with raw milk and foods made with uncooked eggs. There are too many unknowns to predict whether H5N1 will kill people here. It seems unlikely, but better to be prepared. Here's what needs to change: Don't censure the scientists Like H5N1, COVID-19 was full of unknowns. The federal government's biggest mistake was to aim for an illusion of consensus — rather than welcoming debate. The feds silenced anyone, including scientists, who disagreed. The result was a long string of deadly mistakes, from shuttering businesses to mandatory masking to school closures. Stanford health professor Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and former Harvard medical professor Martin Kulldorff coauthored the Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020 showing that protecting the elderly and vulnerable, rather than shutting down the entire nation, would save more lives. Within hours, federal bigwigs Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci launched a smear campaign to label Bhattacharya and his fellow signers 'fringe epidemiologists.' Worse, the CDC and Department of Homeland Security conspired with major social-media platforms such as YouTube and Twitter (now X) to keep the public from hearing from the government's critics. Censored scientists sued. The case, Murthy v. Missouri, is before the US Supreme Court. The Biden administration is taking the wrong side, claiming censorship protects the nation from 'disinformation.' That's a sign the administration can't be trusted to tell us the truth during the next health scare. Create a domestic supply chain for hospital supplies When COVID-19 struck, the United States was caught short of masks, respirators and other hospital gear. One-third of America's imported medical supplies for COVID came from China. In early 2020, the Chinese Communist Party nationalized medical supplies, cutting off exports. US shortages continue even now. On Nov. 27, 2023, Biden called for 'assessments' of the nation's domestic production capacity. Sorry, too late for more reports. Time to act. Curb dictatorial governors During COVID-19, state Legislatures like sheep ceded their authority to governors, allowing them to shutter schools, churches, businesses and recreational facilities. Fortunately, some states eventually came to their senses, including New York, and undid those grants of authority or time-limited them. Biden and the left-wing media were highly critical of these states — a sure sign more states need to curb emergency health powers before the next health crisis. Never underestimate government's stupidity Not even four months ago, when public-health authorities were already tracking H5N1's arrival in the United States, the National Institutes of Health awarded funding for a project — Virus Hunters — tasking New York City high schoolers with collecting bird feces from public parks to map the spread of avian influenza. Students will wear face masks and gloves and collect the bird poop with cotton swabs. What could go wrong? Students could contract the virus by touching bird excrement and then their own eyes, nose or mouth, cautions Brown University infectious-disease expert Leonard Mermel. Trust this government with your life? Ridiculous. To prepare for a pandemic, start by curbing government's power over your decisions.

{"id": "436", "title": "Bird Flu Cases Are Detected In New York, So Hands Off", "date": "2024-04-10", "fulltext": "A citizen-science collaboration in New York has turned up a half-dozen birds infected with the avian flu virus. New Yorkers, beware: If you come across a bird or animal that is sick, dead or behaving strangely, keep yourself and your pets at a safe distance. The bird flu virus, H5N1, is present in at least some small fraction of New York City birds, according to a new study. The finding is not entirely surprising, given that H5N1 has now been shown to affect migratory birds, a wide range of wild animals, poultry and, as of last month, dairy cows. Still, its discovery in the city is an unpleasant reminder that urban spaces are not exempt. People generally associate zoonotic diseases with rural settings, farms or the wilderness, said Florian Krammer, a flu expert at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York who led the study, which was published online last week. But New York City has many green spaces and bodies of water used by migratory and local birds, he said: 'There is an extensive interface between wild animals and humans in cities.' 'There is no reason to panic, but it's good to be aware of it,' he added. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned health care providers to watch for signs of bird flu infection. So far, only two Americans have been reported as infected with H5N1, one in 2022 and the other earlier this month. The virus has caused large outbreaks in mink and foxes, and wiped out thousands of marine mammals, especially in South America. Scientists have tracked the virus along migratory routes and stopovers, among wild birds in rural areas and commercial poultry operations and, most recently, among cattle on dairy farms. But by now, the virus 'is everywhere,' said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University. 'I would be surprised if in any urban environment you went into, you didn't find some small percentage of H5.' 'This is an important lesson for all big cities,' she added. Migratory birds and other species live in urban green spaces and wetlands, where they may encounter scavengers, like squirrels, pets and even people. Cats and dogs are susceptible to the bird flu virus and can acquire it from infected birds, their feces or contaminated water. 'People don't think there's much wildlife in New York City, but we're really quite rich,' said Rita McMahon, director and co-founder of the nonprofit Wild Bird Fund, a wildlife rehabilitation center in New York City. The new study is a product of the New York City Virus Hunters initiative, a collaboration between the rehabilitation center, Mount Sinai scientists, community members and a science outreach organization. It includes high school students who are members of minority groups underrepresented in science. From January 2022 to November 2023, researchers collected samples from bird species ranging from wild ducks and geese to shorebirds and raptors. Some of the birds were already dead; others showed neurological symptoms and were euthanized. Among the roughly 1,900 samples from the animals, they found versions of H5N1 in six, in four species: Canada geese in the Bronx and Queens; a red-tailed hawk near a major highway in Queens; a Canada goose and a peregrine falcon in Brooklyn; and a chicken in Upper Manhattan. The researchers were not surprised to find the virus in Canada geese and raptors, but 'it was somewhat unexpected to receive samples from a chicken found in Marcus Garvey Park,' they wrote. The team has found two more infected birds since the study ended. 'My expectation is that as we keep looking, we'll find more,' Dr. Krammer said. The low number of infected birds found so far may be the result of the test the researchers used, which does not detect small amounts of virus, he said. Dr. Lakdawala praised the citizen science aspect of the project as way to gather more samples than would be possible only from formal surveillance efforts, while also educating the public on handling samples safely. 'The U.S.D.A. can't do everything, C.D.C. can't do everything,' she said, referring to the federal agencies that typically carry out such surveillance. 'We really need to have broader networks in place so we can get a better snapshot of what's happening and what the viruses are.' At the same time, she said, residents should be responsible and not touch a dead bird. New York City's health department advises residents to report birds and animals that are sick, dead or acting strangely by calling 311. Each year, some 9,000 people bring in wounded wildlife -- from songbirds and pigeons to squirrels and opossums -- to the Wild Bird Fund's rehab center. Some people are teary. Others 'come in kissing a sick goose, thinking it's going to help it,' Ms. McMahon said. But now, New Yorkers should be even more cautious when they see an injured or sick bird or animal, she said. 'It doesn't mean they can't rescue it and bring it to us,' Ms. McMahon said. But people should wear gloves, wrap the animal and take other precautions. And 'no kissing,' she said.

{"id": "437", "title": "Public's fear is a greater threat than bird flu outbreak itself", "date": "2024-04-10", "fulltext": "I have tracked deadly, massive outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry for the past two decades. Hundreds of millions of birds have died, and there has been frequent spillover to other species, including mink, seals, foxes, skunks and even dogs and cats. This week, the nation's largest supplier of eggs stopped production after birds at a plant in Texas tested positive. About 2 million chickens were slaughtered to prevent spread of the illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that a person in Texas had contracted the flu but is displaying only mild symptoms. The public has worried at times about a massive human pandemic, but since 2005, the structure of the bird flu virus has not changed significantly. That is extremely good news, especially when you consider that gain-of-function research conducted in Dr. Ron Fouchier's lab in the Netherlands in 2011 revealed the mutations needed for bird flu to pass from human to human. Monitoring of the virus in nature has shown that those mutations have yet to occur. I spoke with CDC Director Mandy Cohen, who told me that the current spillover of bird flu to cattle has not shown any significant genetic changes. That is also good news. The outbreak has occurred only in a few states (Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas), but cattle are brought from state to state and could have picked up the virus from birds. Dr. Cohen told me that the cattle have shown mild upper respiratory symptoms. The person with bird flu had mild symptoms: conjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms. She said the man was treated with Tamiflu and quickly got better. People in close contact with him also were given Tamiflu, as a precaution against further spread. Dr. Cohen said there is potential for cattle to become the first mammals to become a reservoir of the bird flu. The CDC is working closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track cattle that have or have been exposed to the illness to determine if there is any sustained spread. Over the past two decades, more than 400 million birds either have died from the disease or been culled to prevent transmission. Yet, human cases remain rare, with only 2,634 cases and about 1,000 deaths. Worst-case scenarios don't get me wrong: It is the potential for the virus to adapt to human transmission over time that keeps many scientists and public health specialists up at night. But far too often, those experts are looking at worst-case scenarios to the detriment of public perception. Fear is at the heart of public and media reactions to the potential of bird flu and other viruses to become a much-deadlier threat to humans. David Nabarro, a senior World Health Organization expert on infectious diseases, warned the public in 2005 that up to 150 million people could die of bird flu. And though his prediction was far from reality, it was taken seriously. Since then, there have been intermittent flare-ups of public fears, stoked by the idea that bird flu will become the WHO's so-called Disease X, a virus with a high death rate that spreads quickly. But the species barrier that protects us from bird flu is still in place, and the risk to the public remains extremely low, according to the CDC director. That is not only reassuring now but also is likely to continue to be the case. The greater danger remains the fear of the virus rather than the virus itself. But there is one major caveat. The road map, developed by Dr. Fouchier, for a mutation deadly to humans could end up in the wrong hands. And that risk is enough to keep everyone up at night.

{"id": "438", "title": "Bird flu outbreak is an 'evolving situation'; Experts urge caution in food, animal contact", "date": "2024-04-10", "fulltext": "Officials say the risk to public health remains low and note that there are steps people can take to curb the spread of the virus. Many Americans are brimming with questions after officials in Texas announced the state's first case of bird flu in a human. On April 1, Texas health officials said a person became infected with bird flu, or avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, after close contact with infected cows. The week prior, sick dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas tested positive for bird flu. Bird flu was later reported in a Michigan dairy herd that included cows transported from Texas. Cattle in New Mexico and Idaho are also presumed to be positive for the disease, officials said. The only symptom reported by the Texas patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis, according to an update from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials say the risk to public health remains low. They note that there are steps people can take to curb the spread of the potentially dangerous virus. The events in Texas, they say, raise future concerns about how the bird flu virus evolves. \"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, told USA TODAY. \"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\" But if the virus is being transmitted from cow to cow, Diel stressed, it's important to continue monitoring the virus in the long term to see whether there are potential mutations that could cause spillover into other species, including humans. How does bird flu spread? Bird flu primarily spreads through contact with infected birds. Most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals. Avian flu viruses infect birds' respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which causes them to shed the virus via their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC said. Humans and other mammals can get it when they get enough virus in their eyes, nose, or mouth or inhale it into their lungs. People who have close contact or unprotected contact for long periods are at greater risk of infection. The disease can cause mild upper respiratory issues or severe illness, including pneumonia and multiple organ failure that leads to death. In the U.S., the disease tends to spread from wild birds. However, outbreaks in commercial poultry or backyard flocks that led to deaths have been reported in 48 states since February 2022. Can cats get bird flu? Officials identified the latest bird flu cases in unpasteurized milk from sick cattle at dairy farms in Kansas and Texas, in addition to a positive throat swab of a cow at another Texas dairy farm. This spread to cows is believed to be the first for the species. The other species caught the virus directly from wild birds: cats. Cornell researchers believe the virus was transmitted to Texas dairy cows through contaminated water and other food sources from infected birds migrating through the area. The virus then likely spread among cows who were near each other or the birds, however, there isn't yet definitive proof of this, said Diel, who is an associate professor of virology. In early March, Dr. Elisha Frye, an assistant professor of practice at Cornell's Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, received a call about an outbreak among Texas dairy herds of a disease of unknown origin. Samples of milk and manure and nasal swabs from the cattle showed bird flu was present. Researchers also found evidence of bird flu in the testing of dead birds and one of three cats found dead at the dairy facilities around the same time. \"It was kind of the same timeline as when we found it in the cattle samples, but it did kind of link it together,\" Frye told USA TODAY. \"The birds, the cat and milk from the cows all having the same pathogen in them made sense at the time for that being the main cause of illness.\" How do humans get bird flu? It's rare for humans to be infected with bird flu. The only other human case in the U.S. occurred in 2022, in a person incarcerated in a Colorado prison who was exposed to poultry infected with avian flu. On April 2, the CDC said the current public health risk is low, and there is no person-to-person spread of bird flu so far. That is a vital measurement that would prompt concern for the spread of the disease. There remains an increased risk for poultry, livestock and farmers and workers in these sectors, as well as veterinarians, veterinary staff and first responders who respond to cases, officials said. Do eggs carry bird flu? What about dairy products? Food production officials have been taking steps to prevent the distribution of milk or eggs from infected animals. Cooked eggs and pasteurized milk, in general, should be safe for consumers. On April 2, the largest U.S. chicken egg supplier reported positive tests for bird flu at its facility in the Texas Panhandle. In a news release, Cal-Maine Foods said production at the Panhandle facility stopped temporarily, following protocols to prevent bird flu set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Personnel at the company killed about 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 young hens to curb the spread of the virus. There isn't as simple of a solution to reduce the risk of bird flu since the eggs can carry the virus, so the traditional method has been to destroy products and kill the poultry, said Diel, of Cornell. Among dairy cows, milk from animals suspected or confirmed to have the virus is being removed from human food supplies. However, even if milk from infected cows makes it to the commercial milk supply, pasteurization effectively inactivates bacteria and viruses, including influenza, according to a March 29 joint news release from the CDC, USDA and the Food and Drug Administration. In addition to protecting against bird flu, pasteurization is central to other health efforts. The FDA says that unpasteurized raw milk can have microorganisms dangerous to humans. Dr. Meghan Davis, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it's important to note differences among industries in poultry and cattle, and how the virus gets treated: Chicken culling, or killing, has been a steadfast way to curb disease spread, where this is a first for cattle, and it appears cows aren't getting as sick. She said people are at risk if they consume raw milk and cheese or live near an area with dairy production. The spread among cows is a red flag for public health officials and veterinary care professionals. But Davis said she was encouraged by the fact that the person with bird flu only had mild eye problems and the cows had mild symptoms. \"If that's the worst we see, then that's good,\" she said. \"But we don't yet know.\" How can bird flu be stopped? The latest developments are reminders for Americans to take standard precautions when storing, cooking and consuming food, said Darin Detwiler, a professor of food policy at Northeastern University, who has advised the USDA and FDA on food safety. The recommendations include frequent hand-washing when preparing food, properly cooking eggs and meat and reducing consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. Detwiler says consumers should be proactive if they have concerns. \"That's our power as consumers that are stakeholders in this,\" he told USA TODAY. \"We don't have to wait until we're harmed to voice our support or concern over some of these issues.\" Other ways to avoid contracting bird flu include eliminating unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry or domesticated birds, or other sick or dead wild or domesticated animals. People working directly with animals who could be infected should wear personal protective equipment such as face masks as well as goggles, gloves, boots and boot covers. They should use fluid-resistant coveralls and disposable head or hair covers. People who have spent time near animals confirmed or suspected of being sick should be monitored for 10 days after the exposure. This includes those who were wearing PPE.

{"id": "439", "title": "Should you worry about bird flu? A doctor explains", "date": "2024-04-11", "fulltext": "(CNN) - A worker on a dairy farm in Texas tested positive for the avian flu, only the second case of a person in the United States who has contracted the H5N1 influenza strain. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the person was diagnosed with the H5N1 virus and was recovering with mild symptoms. The first case, in 2022, was diagnosed in a Colorado man who was directly exposed to poultry. The risk to the public remains low, according to the CDC, but I still have questions. What exactly is the avian flu, and how is it transmitted? What symptoms do infected people experience, and what treatments exist? Is there a vaccine? Should people avoid eating poultry and drinking milk? To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore's health commissioner. CNN: What exactly is the bird flu? Dr. Leana Wen: Bird flu, also called avian flu or avian influenza, refers to infections caused by the avian influenza Type A viruses. These viruses generally spread among wild birds, especially wild aquatic birds such as ducks and geese. They can also infect domestic poultry and other animals. Avian influenza A viruses are divided into two categories: low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses and high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A viruses. Most LPAI viruses cause no signs of disease or mild disease in birds, but HPAI viruses can cause severe disease and are associated with high mortality. Some subtypes, for instance, have as high mortality rates as 90% to 100% in chickens. In addition, some LPAI viruses can mutate into HPAI variants. CNN: How is bird flu transmitted? Wen: By far, the most common form of transmission is from bird-to-bird. Infected birds can shed the virus through bodily fluids from their nose, mouth and feces. Other birds can become infected through direct contact with the virus particles, or through contact with surfaces contaminated with viruses from infected birds. The H5N1 avian flu virus has been causing outbreaks among poultry in the US, with 48 states and over 85 million poultry now affected. This virus is highly contagious among domestic poultry and can spread through an entire flock within a matter of days. CNN: Can bird flu be transmitted to other animals, including humans? Wen: Yes, some forms of bird flu can be transmitted to other animals. Since 2022 in the US, the avian flu H5N1 virus has been detected in more than 200 mammals. In March 2024, a multistate outbreak of this virus was reported in dairy cattle. The person in Texas who was just diagnosed with it presumably contracted it through exposure. In this case, the cattle are what is known as the intermediate host since the virus passed from birds to cattle and then to humans. It is also possible for humans to contract the virus directly from infected birds. Direct infection can occur if the virus gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth. It can also occur if the virus is inhaled or if a person touches a surface that has the virus on it and then touches their nose, mouth or eyes. However, such transmission is rare and is primarily to be a risk for people who have close and prolonged contact with infected birds and their environments. The individual who was infected in Colorado in 2022, for instance, had direct exposure to birds and to culling poultry. CNN: Can bird flu be transmitted from person to person? Wen: There have been instances of people infected with bird flu transmitting it to other human beings, but this is rare and sporadic. Most such cases have involved family members with prolonged close household exposure to a symptomatic person. There have also been a few cases of human-to-human transmission in hospital settings after unprotected exposure. With the current H5N1 spread among cattle and in poultry, there is no sign of person-to-person spread of this virus at this time, according to the CDC. CNN: What symptoms do infected people experience? Wen: Symptoms can range from mild, such as runny nose, sore throat, eye redness and headache, to severe disease-causing pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The person in Texas who was just diagnosed with H5N1 is reportedly only having conjunctivitis, or pink eye, as his only symptoms. The person in Colorado predominantly had fatigue. CNN: What treatments exist? Wen: There are a variety of antiviral drugs approved to treat influenza. These include forms that can be taken as pills by mouth. They reduce the likelihood of developing severe illness once someone is infected. Some antivirals are also approved for post-exposure prophylaxis, meaning that they are given to people who have not yet developed the illness but have had exposure to the virus. CNN: Is there a vaccine against the bird flu? Wen: There are vaccines that target H5N1, but they are not yet produced in large quantities and are not currently commercially available. The seasonal flu vaccine does not protect people against infection from the avian flu. However, the seasonal flu vaccine does reduce the risk of becoming ill with human and bird flu viruses at the same time, and is recommended for everyone 6 months and above, especially those who have exposure to birds. CNN: Is it safe to eat chicken and chicken eggs and to drink milk? Wen: It is safe to drink milk that has been pasteurized. The process of pasteurization kills bacteria and viruses, including any influenza viruses that may be present in the milk. Similarly, it is safe to eat poultry, including chicken and eggs, that have been properly handled and cooked. CNN: Are there specific preventive measures that people should take? Wen: The CDC has a list of measures that people can take. Most of them involve precautions to be undertaken", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "There have been instances of people infected with bird flu transmitting it to other human beings, but this is rare and sporadic.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "In addition, some LPAI viruses can mutate into HPAI variants.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "The H5N1 avian flu virus has been causing outbreaks among poultry in the US, with 48 states and over 85 million poultry now affected.

{"id": "440", "title": "Bird flu detected among chickens in Texas and Michigan", "date": "2024-04-12", "fulltext": "Ca-Maine Foods, largest fresh egg producer in US, temporarily halts production at one Texas facility after discovering virus Avian influenza has been detected among chickens in Texas and Michigan, following news of the virus infecting livestock and then a person for the first time in the US and potentially leading to supply chain issues. The developments have led to a heightened focus on the potential risks of the virus, especially in the wake of the devastating coronavirus pandemic. But experts are saying that there is little chance of transmission between humans at this point. Cal-Maine Foods, the largest producer of fresh eggs in the US, has temporarily halted production at one Texas facility and is killing 1.6 million hens and 337,000 chicks—3.6% of its entire flock—after discovering the highly pathogenic virus among its domesticated birds. “These are hard times for dairies and the poultry folks,” said Lewis R. “Bud” Dinges, Texas state veterinarian and executive director of the Texas animal health commission. Outbreaks like these may have repercussions on the price of poultry and eggs, particularly if the virus keeps spreading in domesticated flocks—much like the 2022-23 outbreak that raised the price of eggs by 70%. Continued spread among chickens could also threaten the production of the flu vaccine, which relies on 140m eggs a year to incubate inoculations. The CDC released a health advisory notice last Friday, recommending that doctors keep a lookout for possible avian flu among patients, especially those who frequently come into close contact with birds and animals. Anyone in contact with birds and livestock, including agricultural workers, hunters, and backyard farmers, should wear protective gear and follow strict hygiene standards. They “must need to pay extra attention to biosecurity and cleaning and disinfecting,” Dinges said. “Make sure they wash their hands and wear protective clothing and leave their clothing at the facility where they work—clothing and footwear if at all possible.” An inmate who was culling infected flocks in Colorado became the first person in the US with a known bird flu infection in 2022. On 20 March, Minnesota reported that baby goats were sickened by bird flu, marking the first time the virus had been discovered in livestock. Days later, the virus was also discovered among cows. Cows in North Carolina tested positive for bird flu on Wednesday, bringing the affected count up to 21 herds in seven states. Genomic sequencing revealed that the spillover to cows did not seem to make the virus more transmissible to humans this time, so the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is still low, said Seema Lakdawala, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University School of Medicine. “Transmission of influenza viruses in humans requires lots of different variables to align just right, and the current H5N1 viruses do not have all the correct parameters for spreading between humans,” she wrote in an email. “However, the more the virus spills from birds into other hosts like cattle, foxes, seals, etc., the more likely the virus is to change and gain properties that could lead to successful human-to-human transmission.” Avian influenza is “an emerging disease” among livestock, Dinges said, “and there’s a lot that we don’t know about the pathogenesis in the cow itself. We’re still kind of learning as we go here.” It’s not clear how the herds encountered the virus, but the genomic sequences are very similar—pointing to a single introduction, probably from a dead bird, that spread within the herds rather than several introductions over time. The outbreak among dairy cows could lead to local shortages, but for now it’s unlikely to create national or regional shortages or price increases, said Tinglong Dai, professor of business at the Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School. That’s because the US is in its high season for milk production. “In the spring and summer, usually, you have higher yields than during the winter,” he said. “Suppose this happened in the fall or in the winter: the supply chain impact would have been much bigger.” If the outbreak among cows continues in the fall, it could affect supply and prices. In the meantime, affected cows are being isolated until their illnesses pass. Chickens, on the other hand, usually die from the virus, so producers cull them as soon as the virus is detected. “The most effective way to stop the spread is to kill the chickens,” Dai said. That means prices for poultry and eggs could be more affected by this outbreak than for milk and cheese. The manufacturing process for flu shots also relies heavily on eggs, and egg shortages in the past have led to vaccine shortages. So far, no vaccine makers have reported shortages. “It’s just if the situation keeps going—if infection spreads, again, we need to monitor very, very closely,” Dai said. “This also depends on how this is going to evolve in the coming days.” Scientists are sounding the alarm in order to keep farmers and other agricultural workers safe, and to continue monitoring the spread of the virus. For example, it’s not clear how common it is for avian influenza to spill over from birds to animals, Lakdawala said. “Currently, in the US, most of this surveillance is from examination of animals that are found sick or died.” If the virus has been quietly spilling over into other animal hosts that don’t get very sick or die—as with white-tailed deer and Covid—scientists don’t know about it. That’s why they need more funding for monitoring concerning viruses like the flu, Lakdawala said. “This is a gap we need to try to fill, but is hard to do without more resources and investment into large-scale surveillance programs.”", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "This also depends on how this is going to evolve in the coming days.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "However, the more the virus spills from birds into other hosts like cattle, foxes, seals, etc., the more likely the virus is to change and gain properties that could lead to successful human-to-human transmission.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "If the virus has been quietly spilling over into other animal hosts that don’t get very sick or die—as with white-tailed deer and Covid—scientists don’t know about it.", "affirm_why_count": 2, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "The developments have led to a heightened focus on the potential risks of the virus, especially in the wake of the devastating coronavirus pandemic.", "affirm_keywords_count": 1, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "But experts are saying that there is little chance of transmission between humans at this point.", "deny_transmissible_statement_3": "“Transmission of influenza viruses in humans requires lots of different variables to align just right, and the current H5N1 viruses do not have all the correct parameters for spreading between humans,” she wrote in an email.", "deny_transmissible_count": 2, "deny_why_statement_1": "Genomic sequencing revealed that the spillover to cows did not seem to make the virus more transmissible to humans this time, so the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is still low, said Seema Lakdawala, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University School of Medicine.", "deny_why_statement_2": "Transmission of influenza viruses in humans requires lots of different variables to align just right, and the current H5N1 viruses do not have all the correct parameters for spreading between humans.", "deny_why_count": 2, "deny_keywords_statement_1": "The developments have led to a heightened focus on the potential risks of the virus, especially in the wake of the devastating coronavirus pandemic.", "deny_keywords_count": 1}
{"id": "441", "title": "Opinion: H5N1 bird flu in U.S. cattle: A wake-up call to action", "date": "2024-04-12", "fulltext": "The recent detection of H5N1 bird flu in U.S. cattle, coupled with reports of a dairy worker contracting the virus, demands a departure from the usual reassurances offered by federal health officials. While they emphasize there's no cause for alarm and assert diligent monitoring, it's imperative we break from this familiar script. H5N1, a strain of the flu virus known to infect bird species globally and several mammalian species in the U.S. since 2022, has now appeared to have breached a new barrier of inter-mammalian transmission, as exemplified by the expanding outbreak in dairy cows in several jurisdictions linked to an initial outbreak in Texas. Over time, continued transmission among cattle is likely to yield mutations that will further increase the efficiency of mammal-to-mammal transmission. Health care providers should ask themselves 'Could this be an H5N1 infection?' if they are faced with a patient with what CDC called a relevant exposure history for instance, someone who works with dairy cows or lives with someone who works with dairy cows. The illness should be considered for a range of mild, medium, and severe symptoms, from conjunctivitis to fever, shortness of breath, or pneumonia and/or organ failure, the CDC said. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy Any patient suspected of having H5N1 flu should be isolated and cared for by medical professionals wearing protective equipment. Suspected cases should be started on the flu drug oseltamivir sold as Tamiflu even before test results confirming the infection have come back, the agency said. The CDC said the individual known to have been infected, who worked on a dairy farm in Texas, is recovering from very mild symptoms effectively only conjunctivitis, sometimes called pink eye. The individual was treated with oseltamivir, as were people who had been in contact with that individual before the diagnosis. So far, there is no indication of secondary spread from this person. 'No additional cases of human infection with HPAI A(H5N1) virus associated with the current infections in dairy cattle and birds in the United States, and no human-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) virus have been identified,' the CDC advisory said. Related: Why a leading bird flu expert isn't convinced that the risk H5N1 poses to people has declined HPAI is shorthand for highly pathogenic avian influenza, a term that describes how a flu virus behaves when it infects poultry. H5N1 viruses, which have been circulating on and off since 1997, decimate poultry flocks. In cows, however, the illness has been mild to date, with infected animals showing a decline in milk production and decreased feed consumption. Dairy operations have been instructed to destroy milk from infected animals; milk from infected animals has been found to contain H5N1 viruses. Even if contaminated milk were to make its way into the human food chain, pasteurization would destroy the viruses, the Food and Drug Administration has said. Consumption of raw milk or raw milk cheese from infected cows could pose a health risk and should be avoided, the CDC said. Infected cows have been reported from Texas (eight herds), Kansas (three), New Mexico (two), and Idaho, Michigan, and Ohio (one apiece). Trending Now: Why a leading bird flu expert isn't convinced that the risk H5N1 poses to people has declined It is unclear if the virus has been transmitting from cow-to-cow through the respiratory route, in the way human flu spreads, or whether some aspect of dairy operations the movement of cattle from winter grazing grounds back to northern states, a lack of cleaning of milking equipment as it is moved from cow to cow is fueling spread of the virus. The CDC's advisory said that analyses of viruses taken from the infected person, from cows, and from wild birds and poultry showed only small genetic changes.

{"id": "442", "title": "Bird flu is spreading to more farm animals. Are milk and eggs safe?", "date": "2024-04-13", "fulltext": "A bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows has grown to affect more than two dozen herds in eight states, just weeks after the nation's largest egg producer found the virus in its chickens. Health officials stress that the risk to the public is low and that the U.S. food supply remains safe and stable. 'At this time, there continues to be no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, or that it affects the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,' the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement. Here's what you need to know about bird flu and food: WHICH STATES HAVE FOUND BIRD FLU IN DAIRY COWS? As of Friday, the strain of bird flu that has killed millions of wild birds in recent years has been found in at least 26 dairy herds in eight U.S. states: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and South Dakota. The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in a range of mammals over the last few years, but this is the first time it has been found in cattle, according to federal health and animal agencies. Genetic analysis of the virus does not show that it has changed to spread more easily in people, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. HOW IS BIRD FLU AFFECTING FOOD PRODUCTION? Agriculture officials in at least 17 states have restricted imports of dairy cattle from states where the virus has been detected, but, so far, government agencies say it's had little effect on commercial milk production. Officials believe cows likely have been infected by exposure to wild birds, but said cow-to-cow spread 'cannot be ruled out.' Farmers are testing cows that show symptoms of infection, including sharply reduced milk supply and lethargy. Animals that show signs or test positive for illness are being separated from other animals on the farms. The animals appear to recover within two weeks. U.S. egg producers are watching the situation closely after bird flu was detected in chickens in Texas and Michigan. Millions of birds have been killed, but the FDA said the risk of affected eggs getting into the retail market or causing infections in humans is low because of federal inspections and other safeguards. DOES PASTEURIZATION KILL BIRD FLU? Scientists say there's no evidence to suggest that people can contract the virus by consuming food that's been pasteurized, or heat-treated or properly cooked. 'It's not a food safety concern,' said Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University. Two people in U.S. have been infected with bird flu to date. A Texas dairy worker who was in close contact with an infected cow recently developed a mild eye infection and has recovered. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a Colorado poultry farm. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. IS GROCERY STORE MILK SAFE FROM BIRD FLU? Yes, according to food safety experts and government officials. U.S. producers are barred from selling milk from sick cows and must divert and destroy it. In addition, milk sold across state lines is required to be pasteurized, or heat-treated using a process that kills bacteria and viruses, including influenza. 'We firmly believe that pasteurization provides a safe milk supply,' Tracey Forfa, director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine told a webinar audience this week. IS RAW MILK SAFE FROM BIRD FLU? The FDA and the CDC are less certain about unpasteurized, or raw, milk sold in many states, saying there's limited information about the possible transmission of the H5N1 virus in such products. So far, no herds linked to raw milk providers have reported cows infected with bird flu, but the agencies recommend that the industry not make or sell raw milk or raw milk cheese products made with milk from cows that show symptoms or are exposed to infected cows. U.S. health officials have long warned against the risk of foodborne illness tied to raw milk, which the CDC said caused more than 200 outbreaks that sickened more than 2,600 people between 1998 and 2018. Still, raw milk proponents like Mark McAfee, owner of Raw Farm USA in Fresno, Calif., said the outbreak of H5N1 in commercial cows appears to have spurred higher sales of the products, despite federal warnings. CAN YOU CATCH BIRD FLU FROM EGGS OR MEAT? Only dairy cows, not beef cattle, have been infected or shown signs of illness to date, agriculture officials said. The largest egg producer in the U.S. temporarily halted operations on April 2 after finding bird flu in its chickens. Cal-Maine Foods culled about 1.6 million laying hens and another 337,000 pullets, or young hens, after the detection. The company said there was no risk to eggs in the market and that no eggs had been recalled. Eggs that are handled properly and cooked thoroughly are safe to eat, said Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University. 'A lot of people like runny eggs. Personally, if I eat an egg, it's very well cooked,' she said. Still, Kowalcyk and others cautioned that the situation could change. 'This is an emerging issue and clearly this pathogen is evolving and there's a lot that we don't know,' she said.

The disease, which has swept the globe after it originated in poultry farms in Asia, has caused devastating declines in bird populations. It has also now jumped to mammals and some cases have been found in humans, though it has not been found to be spreading from human to human. The annual watchlist produced by the RBST also highlights concerns for native pig breeds. British Pig Association data shows declining numbers overall for the priority category pig breeds, including the Berkshire pig (total sows down from 363 in 2021 to 288 in 2023) and the Tamworth pig (total sows reduced from 304 in 2020 to 239 in 2023). These declines continue after the pig market failure caused by rising costs, meaning farmers were being offered less than the cost of production for their products. The UK pig population has fallen from about 8m in the 1990s to just over 5m today. The Rare Breeds Survival Trust chief executive, Christopher Price, said: “Today’s new RBST watchlist reflects the major challenges faced by people keeping pigs and poultry over the past two years, notably the avian flu outbreaks and the sustained increase in animal feed and husbandry costs. We have moved all native poultry breeds to the priority category as we continue providing urgent support for these irreplaceable breeds’ conservation. Seven of the UK’s 11 native pig breeds remain in the priority category, with most of the rare pig breeds now showing a sustained downward trend in total sow numbers. The at-risk Welsh pig, for example, has fallen from 457 sows in 2020 to 296 in 2023. We must reverse these worrying declines before it is too late.” Native breeds of livestock are often used in rewilding projects for grazing because they tend to be hardier, so do not have to be kept indoors. Native poultry breeds are often seen as more sustainable and preferable to broiler chickens from an animal welfare perspective because they grow more slowly and tend to be kept free range. Tom Davis, and RBST trustee and farm manager at Mudchute Park & Farm in east London, said: “The UK’s brilliant array of rare and native poultry is under serious threat. Under the continued threat of avian influenza, there is a clear decline in active breeding programmes and when breed populations are so low, losing flocks can be devastating. Collecting comprehensive rare breed poultry data to steer conservation efforts is a serious challenge, and we really need more people to be encouraged to keep these birds and work with RBST and breed societies to help conserve them for the generations of the future.”", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "It has also now jumped to mammals and some cases have been found in humans, though it has not been found to be spreading from human to human.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The disease, which has swept the globe after it originated in poultry farms in Asia, has caused devastating declines in bird populations.

{"id": "444", "title": "Bird Flu And Cows", "date": "2024-04-16", "fulltext": "Here's what we know -- and don't know -- about the risk the virus poses in food. A strain of avian influenza that has killed millions of birds in recent years has now been detected in dairy cows in several states, prompting concerns about the safety of the U.S. dairy supply. Federal health and agriculture officials released a statement last week stressing that there 'continues to be no concern' about the safety of the commercial milk supply, while underscoring that the agencies are continuing to monitor the situation as it evolves. Scientists know that bird flu can spread to humans when they come into contact with infected animals, including dead ones, without wearing protective gear, which seems to have been the case with a person recently infected in Texas. So far, there isn't any evidence to suggest that humans can contract bird flu by consuming food that has been pasteurized or cooked, said Benjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University. 'That's not to say it couldn't happen,' he said. 'It's just that we have a pretty robust history of it not happening. And that's good news.' However, there are a few key points that researchers are still working to understand, Dr. Chapman and other experts said, like just how widespread the current outbreak is in cows, or exactly how the virus spread to them. Public safety agencies have said that it's not clear what risks surround unpasteurized products. 'In the column of known versus unknown, there's a lot more in the unknown part,' said Dr. Gail Hansen, a veterinary public health expert and independent public health consultant. What do we know about bird flu and dairy products? Avian flu was detected in unpasteurized milk samples from sick cows last month, but the Food and Drug Administration has said that the commercial supply of pasteurized milk remains safe and that it 'does not currently have concerns' about pasteurized cheese. Milk from sick cows is being diverted or destroyed so it does not end up on store shelves. The pasteurization process, which works by heating milk to destroy pathogens, will kill influenza, said Matthew Moore, an assistant professor in the department of food science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Raw or unpasteurized milk, which has become increasingly accessible in the United States over the last decade, already puts people at a higher risk from harmful germs. 'Now there's a whole new level of concern,' said Darin Detwiler, a food safety expert and professor at Northeastern University's College of Professional Studies. 'I don't think that one can make an argument that we shouldn't be concerned about drinking raw milk in this era.' The F.D.A. said that it does not yet know whether people can contract avian flu by consuming raw milk and cheese products made from infected cows. The agency recommended that manufacturers refrain from making raw milk or raw milk cheese from cows that show symptoms. What about meat? The confirmed cases so far have been in dairy cows, not those used for meat, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it is 'confident that the meat supply is safe.' The agriculture industry has safeguards to identify and quarantine sick animals so that they do not end up in the food or dairy supply. Scientists are still trying to figure out if cows shed the virus before they are symptomatic; if they do, it could raise new concerns. But proper cooking would render the virus harmless, said Aljoša Trmcic, a dairy safety expert at the Cornell College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. The same precautions that prevent people from getting sick from pathogens such as salmonella can help prevent contamination with the virus, Dr. Chapman said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends four simple steps: frequently clean your hands and the surfaces you use to prep food with soap and water; keep raw meat, poultry, fish and juices separate from other foods; use a food thermometer to ensure you've cooked food to the right temperature; and do not leave food at room temperature for more than two hours, or for more than one hour when the temperature is above 90 degrees. 'All the precautions that you would normally take for just sensible handling of raw meat would be good enough,' Dr. Moore said. Are eggs safe to eat? Cal-Maine Foods, a major producer of eggs in the United States, announced this week that it had detected avian flu in a Texas facility and culled over one million birds. Infected hens most likely will lay eggs that are also infected with the virus, Dr. Trmcic said, but he added that it's very unlikely for a contaminated egg to make it onto the market with the industry controls in place. Egg products -- like liquid egg whites -- are pasteurized. But most whole eggs sold in cartons are not pasteurized on the inside, Dr. Trmcic said. You need to properly cook them to kill pathogens like avian flu, but also more common germs like salmonella. That includes making sure both yolks and whites are firm, not runny. You may also want to avoid dough, sauces, drinks or other items that use raw or undercooked eggs, Dr. Detwiler said. 'I'm not saying avoid eating eggs or avoid drinking milk,' Dr. Detwiler said. 'Go forward with caution, and think about how some practices may have more risk than others.'

{"id": "445", "title": "Why the spread of bird flu to a Texas dairy worker is so alarming", "date": "2024-04-16", "fulltext": "Since early 2022, a highly pathogenic strain of avian flu, H5N1, has been infecting wild aquatic birds and domestic poultry in the United States. More than 85 million birds in 48 states have died as a result of the virus or have been culled after exposure to infected birds. This same strain has now spread to cows. Health officials have detected H5N1 in cattle across 16 herds in six states. And this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a case of bird flu in a dairy worker in Texas who likely contracted the virus from cattle. This is an alarming situation that must be monitored closely. Livestock workers and owners of backyard flocks need to take extra precautions, and clinicians should be on the lookout for new human cases. Most Americans, though, should not be concerned about the risk of avian flu to them at this time. Avian influenza is not new. The first description of it dates from the late 1800s. Like human flu viruses, there are multiple strains of bird flu. Some strains cause mild or no symptoms. Others are associated with mortality rates as high as 90 to 100 percent in domesticated bird species. Many bird flu viruses originate in wild aquatic fowl and are then passed on to chickens, turkeys and other domesticated birds. While most transmission occurs among birds, some strains can cross over to infect mammals. The H5N1 strain has already been detected in more than 200 mammals in the United States. That includes humans. In addition to the Texas dairy worker, an individual in Colorado working with poultry was diagnosed with H5N1 in 2022. The dairy worker's only symptom was eye inflammation, and the poultry worker experienced fatigue. But prior cases from elsewhere in the world have resulted in pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death. Indeed, the specter of severe illness is what makes avian flu a worrisome disease. The World Health Organization reports that 887 people globally have been infected with this strain over the past two decades. The mortality rate was 52 percent. That is a terrifying number. Though there are approved H5N1-specific vaccines, it will take months to ramp up production. (The current seasonal flu vaccine probably does not prevent avian flu, though the CDC recommends it because it prevents people from contracting the regular flu at the same time.) There are antiviral treatments that should reduce the risk of hospitalization and death, but mortality could still be substantial if many people become infected. Here's the reassuring part: Transmission among humans has, so far, been uncommon. Most people infected with bird flu worked closely with infected animals. Of those who contracted avian flu from other humans, most were living in the same household with a symptomatic person, resulting in close, prolonged and unprotected exposure. During the current H5N1 outbreaks, there has been no documented human-to-human transmission. Of course, this could change. The more widespread the virus becomes among other mammalian species, the more it could acquire mutations that facilitate its spread among humans. Clinicians need to be on the lookout for people who work with animals and start experiencing symptoms. Scientists must continue tracking the spread of H5N1 in other species, and the federal government should ensure that a robust plan is in place should widespread vaccine distribution be needed. For now, most people do not need to change their daily lives. Specifically, they do not need to stop drinking milk or eating chicken. Pasteurizing milk and cooking poultry kills pathogens, including the avian influenza viruses. Those who have frequent contact with birds should take additional precautions. Bird flu is spread through direct contact with secretions from the animal's mouth or nose, or through its feces. The virus can also be inhaled as well as transmitted from someone touching a contaminated surface and then their mouth, nose or eyes. The CDC recommends that poultry workers, individuals who rehabilitate birds in sanctuaries and people with backyard flocks use eye protection and a well-fitting face mask if they have to handle sick birds. They should avoid touching their mouth, nose or eyes after contact with possibly contaminated objects. Hand-washing is a must, and workers should change clothes after handling birds. Hobbyists, meanwhile, should observe wild birds at a distance and especially stay away from birds that look sick or have died. Finally, it's worth remembering that avian flu is one of more than 200 diseases that are spread between animals and humans. Zoonotic diseases have been increasing with warming climates, urbanization and the destruction of natural habitats, which have all accelerated contact between humans and wild animals. Protecting humans from these diseases requires not only better surveillance and expedited vaccine research, but also environmental measures that safeguard biodiversity.", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "yes", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": "not ascertainment bias", "feedback_2": "The article reports a human mortality rate of 52% for the H5N1 strain.

{"id": "446", "title": "Opinion: What worries scientists like me about bird flu", "date": "2024-04-17", "fulltext": "(CNN) — The headlines are concerning: 'Highly pathogenic avian influenza found in Texas, Kansas dairy cattle.' 'Bird flu detected in dairy worker.' 'First human case of avian flu in Texas raises alarm.' Could this be how the next pandemic begins? Well, so far US officials are saying they believe there is minimal risk to the public from the latest iteration of bird flu. But with growing evidence of potential mammal-to-mammal spread just weeks after the new bird flu was detected in cows, many of us in the biosecurity and pandemic preparedness community believe that leaders in capitals around the globe should be working to get ahead of this new public health threat in case the H5N1 flu virus gains the ability to spread among humans. There have also been documented cases of transmission to people: Earlier this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a second person in the US had tested positive for bird flu. The first US H5N1 human case was in 2022, involving a poultry worker in Colorado, and the more recent case involved a dairy worker who had direct contact with infected cattle in Texas. Both human cases had mild symptoms, were treated and fully recovered, but previous bird flu cases in other parts of the world have been much more severe, causing fatalities in many cases. What we don't know — and what has scientists worried — is whether the virus will evolve in a way that enables it to spread more readily among human populations. In March, a first case was reported of H5N1 virus in cattle and while direct cow-to-cow transmission has yet to be confirmed, the occurrence of cases in cattle across at least six states suggests that cows may be transmitting the flu virus directly among themselves as they are transported to different farms, as opposed to being infected by sick birds. While we face uncertainty about what will happen next, many scientists say stepped-up government action is warranted because of the risk that bird flu could turn into a pandemic. Many researchers believe that Covid-19 may have started in a similar way — spreading from animals to humans by first gaining the ability to spread among mammals that came into contact with humans, and then evolving to transmit directly between humans. The US and other governments around the world need to take H5N1 seriously and demonstrate that we've learned the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic that turned our lives upside-down for years. They should take immediate steps to get out ahead of this risk rather than taking a 'wait and see' approach. In the short term, governments should act now to deploy the capacities at their disposal to guard against the uncontrolled spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus if it evolves to spread between people. This includes funding research on vaccines that are likely to be effective against the virus, stepping up surveillance of livestock and humans and wider emergency response planning. It has been encouraging to hear that the US Department of Health and Human Services has stepped up surveillance systems and supported testing of potential vaccine candidates that could be more effective against this strain of bird flu than the existing, limited stocks of H5N1 vaccine developed many years ago. Moving forward, it will be critical for human and animal health sectors — including the CDC and the US Department of Agriculture — to work together on bio-surveillance, including by developing a shared approach to monitoring human and animal populations and by exchanging data, to keep tabs on how the virus is evolving. Additionally, if the US government succeeds in identifying an effective vaccine for the new bird flu, it will be important to draw up plans to rapidly produce the vaccine, so that it is ready to go if needed. Further, the US and other governments should think through how to update and act on their existing pandemic flu response plans in case H5N1 begins to spread among humans. To be prepared for a possible outbreak of bird flu, governments around the world need to take these steps now, even in the face of uncertainty. If they wait for a confirmed outbreak among people, it will be extremely difficult to prevent the uncontrolled spread of the virus. It's also time to reassess the long game and make sure that countries around the world have the capacity to detect and respond to future epidemics and pandemics. According to the Global Health Security Index, there are significant gaps in countries' pandemic preparedness capabilities. During the Covid pandemic, we witnessed firsthand that capacity matters when it comes to saving lives. According to a study released last year by experts from the Brown University Pandemic Center, the Gates Foundation and NTI, almost all countries that had strong pandemic preparedness capacity at the outset of Covid had lower death rates than less prepared nations. A broad range of capacities have been shown to be effective, including disease detection systems, systems for distributing medical countermeasures and public health infrastructure to deploy non-pharmaceutical interventions. Playing the long game means investing now to make sure that countries have the capacity they need to respond to a worst-case H5N1 pandemic or to be prepared for the next one. Given the impact of Covid, it is deeply disappointing that national governments are not investing the necessary resources to build life-saving pandemic preparedness capacity. This just doesn't make sense. In the United States, federal funding for pandemic influenza is far below what we need to effectively tackle this threat. Government experts have called for $1.15 billion in funding for pandemic influenza for 2025, but the Biden administration has requested only $335 million. Making matters worse, Congress has made major cuts to pandemic preparedness funding, as part of the ongoing appropriations process. This is also an issue internationally. Most countries — even those with ample resources — have not made financial investments in strengthening pandemic preparedness. The 2021 Global Health Security Index — which measures national-level pandemic preparedness capacity and which was collaboratively developed by NTI, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Economist Impact — found that 155 out of 195 countries have not allocated funds within the last three years to improve capacity (aside from public health emergencies) to address epidemic threats. The White House just announced a new Global Health Security Strategy, which includes a commitment to work with 50 countries to build pandemic preparedness capacity. This is a great step in the right direction, but the US government and their partners will need to make sure they have the financial resources and political will to follow through on this pledge. Playing the long game also means supporting the World Bank Pandemic Fund, which is designed to invest in long-term pandemic preparedness capacity of low- and middle-income countries. The fund received $1.9 billion dollars in pledged resources from national governments, philanthropic organizations and other groups, but it is making grants to support valuable capacity building efforts and will soon run out of funds. Experts estimate that it will take approximately $10 billion per year for at least five years to provide the funding that will allow countries to build infectious disease detection and response capacity that will be needed to guard against pandemics. We must do better. Covid made pandemic risks clear, and unfortunately in many parts of the world, we witnessed the deadly consequences. Governments need to act quickly and decisively now, to get ahead of the growing H5N1 flu public health threat, while also investing in long-term capacity building to make sure the world is better prepared for the next pandemic.

{"id": "447", "title": "Risk of bird flu spreading to humans is �normous concern� says WHO", "date": "2024-04-18", "fulltext": "Chief scientist voices fears about H5N1 variant that has 'extraordinarily high' mortality rate in humans The World Health Organization has raised concerns about the spread of H5N1 bird flu, which has an 'extraordinarily high' mortality rate in humans. An outbreak that began in 2020 has led to the deaths or killing of tens of millions of poultry. Most recently, the spread of the virus within several mammal species, including in domestic cattle in the US, has increased the risk of spillover to humans, the WHO said. 'This remains I think an enormous concern,' the UN health agency's chief scientist, Jeremy Farrar, told reporters in Geneva. Cows and goats joined the list of species affected last month—a surprising development for experts because they were not thought susceptible to this type of influenza. US authorities reported this month that a person in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to dairy cattle, with 16 herds across six states infected apparently after exposure to wild birds. The A(H5N1) variant has become 'a global zoonotic animal pandemic' Farrar said. 'The great concern of course is that in... infecting ducks and chickens and then increasingly mammals, that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically the ability to go from human to human,' he added. So far, there is no evidence that H5N1 is spreading between humans. But in the hundreds of cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals over the past 20 years, 'the mortality rate is extraordinarily high' Farrar said, because humans have no natural immunity to the virus. From 2003 to 2024, 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 have been reported worldwide from 23 countries, according to the WHO, putting the case fatality rate at 52%. The recent US case of human infection after contact with an infected mammal highlights the increased risk. When 'you come into the mammalian population, then you're getting closer to humans' Farrar said, warning that 'this virus is just looking for new, novel hosts' Farrar called for increased monitoring, saying it was 'very important understanding how many human infections are happening... because that's where adaptation [of the virus] will happen' 'It's a tragic thing to say, but if I get infected with H5N1 and I die, that's the end of it,' he said. 'If I go around the community and I spread it to somebody else then you start the cycle.' He said efforts were under way towards the development of vaccines and therapeutics for H5N1, and stressed the need to ensure that regional and national health authorities around the world had the capacity to diagnose the virus.

{"id": "449", "title": "USDA faulted for disclosing scant information about outbreaks of H5N1 avian flu in cattle", "date": "2024-04-18", "fulltext": "With H5N1 bird flu spreading to more dairy cow herds, scientists and pandemic experts in this country and abroad are calling on the U.S. government to release more information to help them assess the risk the outbreaks pose to cattle operations and people. Three and a half weeks after first announcing the startling news that cows from a milking herd in Texas had tested positive for H5N1, the government agencies involved in the investigations have not yet revealed what research shows about whether pasteurization of milk kills this specific virus. And until Thursday, U.S. officials had not disclosed whether the now 28 affected herds in eight states form a single linked outbreak fueled by the movement of cattle from the Texas panhandle, where the first outbreak was discovered. At present, STAT was told, that does not appear to be the case. Other countries are trying to determine whether this event is a strange one-off, or proof that the wily virus has evolved to be able to infect cattle more easily, and what risk their own herds—and potentially people—could face if the latter is true. But they are operating largely in the dark because the United States has released such sparse information, said Marion Koopmans, head of the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. 'A country with capacity like the United States should be able to generate this information within days,' Koopmans said. 'I would expect very fast, very transparent updates and it’s somewhat amazing not to see that happening.' NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy Koopmans said it is crucial to figure out whether this situation is unique to the United States for some reason or changes the risk assessment for ruminants cattle, sheep, and related species globally. 'You would expect there would be some responsibility to share,' she told STAT. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which is leading the investigations into the outbreaks, pushed back on the criticism. 'USDA has been committed from the very beginning to the timely and transparent release of information related to the outbreak as it becomes available,' a spokesperson said by email. 'We will continue to work to provide timely and accurate updates to the public, our stakeholders, and the scientific community as we learn more.' Experts believe the USDA must be gathering samples on an ongoing basis to check for dangerous changes in the virus, but only a few genetic sequences from this outbreak have been uploaded to GISAID, the international database widely used by scientists. And the genetic sequences that have been shared are from early in the outbreak, which means that outside scientists cannot monitor if the virus has changed as it has moved from cow to cow or herd to herd. In its response to STAT, the USDA said it has offered to give outside scientists copies of a sample virus for research purposes. Other viruses from the outbreaks are currently being analyzed by the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the sequences will be shared in the coming days, the spokesperson said. In a frequently asked questions document posted on its website, the USDA stated that 'analysis of sequences of viruses found in cattle thus far have not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans and between people.' The agency does, however, believe the virus has been transmitted from cow to cow, potentially through sequential use of milking equipment. Related: Why a leading bird flu expert isn’t convinced that the risk H5N1 poses to people has declined Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said the USDA’s lack of data sharing is fomenting a sense of distrust about the way the outbreak investigation is being handled. 'They are creating the perception that something is happening or not happening that would not meet with the public’s approval,' Osterholm said. 'And this is really unfortunate. There’s no evidence here that there’s some kind of a smoking gun, that somebody did something wrong. Just tell us what you’re doing. And that’s not happening.' Rick Bright, the former head of the Rockefeller Foundation’s short-lived Pandemic Prevention Institute, and now a consultant in the pandemic preparedness sphere, noted that when the first detected outbreak of H7N9 bird flu exploded in China in the spring of 2013, that country was slammed for not sharing more information and more genetic sequences. (Though H7N9 seems to have subsided, between 2013 and 2017, more than 1,200 human cases of H7N9 were reported, 37% of which were fatal.) Bright criticized the U.S. for not being more forthcoming now, noting that international negotiations on pandemic preparedness are currently trying to reach an agreement that could be signed off on at the May meeting of the World Health Assembly. 'In the context of these pandemic accord discussions right now, where they’re trying to come up with this agreement about sharing data and benefits from data, etc., and we’ve got the United States of America in the midst of an outbreak in dairy cattle … not willing to share data in a timely, transparent manner. What does that tell the rest of the world?' These criticisms come in a week when the Biden administration announced a new program to help 50 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia, develop better disease surveillance and preparedness to try to fend off future pandemics, and a congressional committee tasked with trying to determine whether the Covid-19 pandemic was triggered by a spillover of virus from nature or a laboratory accident grilled the editor of the journal Science. Related: What we know about H5N1 bird flu in cows and the risk to humans In the case of the dairy cattle H5N1 outbreaks, there were reports that as early as February veterinarians were seeing evidence of something amiss in some herds in the Texas panhandle. But it wasn’t until March 25 that the USDA confirmed that a dairy cattle herd in Texas had been infected with H5N1, a virus which until then hadn’t been seen as a threat to cows. In H5’s nearly 30-year history of infecting poultry, wild birds, carnivore mammals, and the occasional human, cows have not been part of the saga. Until now. Multiple additional outbreaks were confirmed in the days that followed, in Texas, then Kansas and Michigan, and then New Mexico, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Dakota. (USDA maintains a list here.) The USDA told STAT on Thursday that it can establish links between affected herds in Texas, New Mexico, and Kansas, but it does not currently have evidence to suggest all affected herds in all impacted states received cows from Texas. While H5N1 kills many of the species it infects, cattle do not appear to be severely sickened by it. Feed consumption drops off and milk from infected cows is discolored and viscous. USDA has reported that milk contains high levels of H5N1 virus. Farmers have been told to discard milk from infected cows, though the USDA, the Food and Drug Administration, and the CDC all routinely state that they believe pasteurization would kill the viruses. But that is based on work done on other pathogens, not H5N1. STAT has been pressing the USDA about whether research is being done to test the effect of pasteurization on H5N1-contaminated milk. USDA officials deferred questions to the FDA, saying it is responsible for food safety. The FDA said the work had not yet been done. When asked whether the research was underway, and when results would be available, the FDA did not reply. 'I am shocked we still don’t have the data on pasteurization,' Bright said. 'The public deserves to know what experiments are being done [and] when can we expect data from those.' Related: CDC to doctors: Look out for bird flu infections among dairy farm workers The movement of H5N1 bird flu into cows is a concern for an important industry, but it also raises the hackles among scientists who have been following this virus. There is always a concern that should the virus acquire the changes needed to be able to spread easily among a mammalian species, it could more readily make the jump to people. Furthermore, should the virus find its way from cows to pigs, alarms would really sound. Pigs are often referred to as 'mixing vessels' for flu viruses, because they can be infected by both bird flu viruses and human flu viruses. If both those types of viruses simultaneously infect a pig, the pathogens could swap genes and potentially produce a version of H5N1 that is more adapted to transmission to and among people. The USDA has already suggested that viruses from one of the infected dairy cattle herds in Michigan has been found to have ignited an outbreak in a nearby poultry operation. 'Additionally, we have similar evidence that the virus also spread from dairy cattle premises back into nearby poultry premises through an unknown route,' it said in its most recent FAQ document. The USDA is currently investigating how that could have happened, looking at, among other things, whether human movement between the farms could have played a role. The locations of the affected dairy farms have not been disclosed, so it’s unclear if any are located near pig farming operations. But the mere possibility of spread from cows to other animals has raised questions about how farmers on affected farms are disposing of contaminated milk. The USDA told STAT farmers should consult their state agricultural authorities for guidance on safe milk disposal. Scientists who study H5N1 would very much like to have a better sense of why dairy cow herds in multiple states have become infected over such a short period of time. And they suspect USDA investigations must have uncovered more information than has been disclosed about how much of the spread is due to cattle movements, or whether contaminated feed stocks or the spring migration of infected wild birds is playing a role. That question is critical; efforts to stop spread to cows and among herds hinges on how they are getting infected, Osterholm said. 'It gets back to the very heart of, ‘How do I pull the pump handle on this one?’' he said, referring to the famous story of British physician John Snow removing the handle from a central London pump that he correctly believed was the source of cholera infections in 1854. After Snow removed the pump handle, infections stopped. If the outbreaks all trace back to a Texas farm or farms, 'that says that there’s some unique transmission going on here between production animal and production animal that we don’t understand,' he said. But if viruses from wild birds touched off outbreaks in multiple spots, focusing on the challenging task of trying to minimize that risk would be important. Osterholm said that the Covid pandemic should have taught government officials that transparency and clear communications are key to successful management of outbreaks. 'That to me is being missed here. And I can’t for the life of me understand why,' he said. 'This is a serious public health challenge, but it shouldn’t be a media challenge. And they’re turning it into one.'", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "Other countries are trying to determine whether this event is a strange one-off, or proof that the wily virus has evolved to be able to infect cattle more easily, and what risk their own herds—and potentially people—could face if the latter is true.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "There is always a concern that should the virus acquire the changes needed to be able to spread easily among a mammalian species, it could more readily make the jump to people.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Furthermore, should the virus find its way from cows to pigs, alarms would really sound.

{"id": "450", "title": "Scientists Fault Federal Response to Bird Flu Outbreaks on Dairy Farms", "date": "2024-04-19", "fulltext": "Officials have shared little information, saying the outbreak was limited. But asymptomatic cows in North Carolina have changed the assessment. In the month since federal authorities announced an outbreak of bird flu on dairy farms, they have repeatedly reassured the public that the spate of infections does not impact the nation's food or milk supply, and poses little risk to the public. Yet the outbreak among cows may be more serious than originally believed. In an obscure online update this week, the Department of Agriculture said there is now evidence that the virus is spreading among cows, and from cows to poultry. Officials in North Carolina have detected bird flu infections in a cattle herd with no symptoms, The New York Times has learned—information the U.S.D.A. has not shared publicly. The finding suggests that the infections may be more widespread than thought. Whether there are asymptomatic animals elsewhere remains unclear, because the U.S.D.A. is not requiring farms to test cattle for infection. It has been reimbursing farmers for testing, but only for 20 cows per farm that were visibly ill. This week, the department said it would begin reimbursing farms for testing cows without symptoms. Federal officials have shared limited genetic information about the virus with scientists and with officials in other countries, which is important for learning how the virus might be evolving as it spreads. They are not actively monitoring infections in pigs, which are famously effective hosts for evolving flu viruses, and which are often kept in proximity to cattle. And officials have said they have 'no concern' about the safety of milk, despite a lack of hard data. In joint statements in March, the U.S.D.A., the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assured the public that pasteurized milk was safe. But the F.D.A. is still conducting tests to ascertain whether the process eliminates the virus. The agency declined to say when results from those tests would be available. Some experts said the agencies should not have asserted that the milk is safe before they had the data in hand, even though there is only a slim chance of risk to people. 'I understand that the milk market is very concerned about a loss of even a few percent of milk consumption,' said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota. But, he added, 'The idea that you can avoid this kind of discussion by just giving absolutes is not going to serve them well.' The federal response so far echoes early missteps during the pandemic, he and other experts said. 'It seems they learned little from the communication lessons that Covid taught us,' Dr. Osterholm said. In an interview this week, Dr. Rosemary Sifford, the U.S.D.A.'s chief veterinarian, said that more than a dozen federal epidemiologists, roughly twice as many laboratory employees, field staff members and academic and state collaborators were all involved in the investigations. 'Please recall that we've been engaged in this for less than a month,' she said. 'We are working very hard to generate more information.' U.S.D.A. staff are analyzing only viral genetic sequences from sick cows, but will release information for outside experts 'in the very, very near future,' Dr. Sifford said. 'We definitely recognize that we need to learn more about the overall picture,' she added. If the department were more forthcoming, scientists outside the government could already be helping to contain the virus, Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, said. 'The days when it was seen as a good plan or acceptable for a government agency to keep all data to manage on its own are gone long ago,' he said. Part of the problem, some experts said, is that the U.S.D.A. has long been in the position of both regulating and promoting the business of agriculture. 'We all want farms to succeed, and we want to have that steady food supply for the American consumer,' said Donn Teske, president of the Kansas Farmers Union. 'But then when you are also tasked with the oversight, it's a little bit of an issue there.' The current version of the bird flu virus has been circulating since 2020 in poultry, wild birds and more recently, a wide range of mammals. As of Friday afternoon, the outbreak in dairy cows had spread to 32 herds in eight states: Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina and South Dakota. It is unclear how the outbreak began on dairy farms. Early data suggest that there were at least two spillovers of the virus from bird to cow, in the Texas Panhandle and New Mexico, Dr. Sifford said. So far among cattle, the virus, called H5N1, seems only to affect lactating cows, and only temporarily. There have been no diagnoses in calves, pregnant heifers or beef cows, and no deaths. But the virus appears to have spilled back, from cows to poultry, in at least one instance in Texas. That infected herd and poultry flock were on different farms. But the virus may have been transported between them by people or animals that had contact with objects contaminated with virus-laden milk, according to the Texas Animal Health Commission. Infected cows appear to carry large amounts of the virus in their milk. (The U.S.D.A. has tested relatively few animals by nasal swab, however, and is not testing feces, a common repository for viruses.) Milking equipment on dairy farms is typically deep-cleaned, but not sterilized, at least once a day. People milking cows are encouraged to wear safety glasses, or masks or face shields, but the recommendations are often ignored. In cows sickened by H5N1, milk production drops sharply, and the milk becomes viscous and yellowish. 'We've never seen something like this before,' said Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. (Milk from infected but asymptomatic cows seems unchanged, according to a spokeswoman for the North Carolina agriculture department.) In interviews, some experts criticized the U.S.D.A.'s testing recommendations, which until this week promised reimbursement only for a pool of animals that were obviously ill. Farmers may not have found many infections simply because they were not looking for them. Widespread testing of animals with and without symptoms is crucial early in outbreaks to understand the scale and the possible mechanisms of viral transmission, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Pigs are a linchpin in flu surveillance, many experts noted, as they are susceptible to both bird and human flu. They might act as 'mixing bowls,' enabling H5N1 to acquire the ability to spread efficiently among people. The U.S.D.A. is not testing pigs or asking farmers to do so, Dr. Sifford said. Testing cows for H5N1 infection requires approval from a state official. Milk samples obtained by an accredited veterinarian are typically packaged in tubes, packed in insulated coolers, and shipped to a U.S.D.A.-approved lab, along with a unique identifier. Positive tests are then confirmed by the U.S.D.A.'s national lab in Iowa. Each step slows the speedy response needed to contain an outbreak, Dr. Inglesby said. Testing should be easy, free and accessible, he said. Dr. Sifford said the U.S.D.A. has already received a 'small number' of samples from cows without symptoms. The department is 'strongly recommending testing before herds are moved between states, which includes asymptomatic herds,' an agency statement said. Already some state health departments and farmers have grown frustrated with the federal approach. Several farms in Minnesota—not one of the eight states with known cases—are sending samples of cow blood to private labs to test for antibodies to the virus, which would indicate a current or past infection, said Dr. Joe Armstrong, a veterinarian at the University of Minnesota Extension. Other dairy farmers are reluctant to test, worried that fears about bird flu could hurt their business, said Dr. Amy Swinford, director of the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. 'I think there's many more dairies that have had this going on than what we've gotten samples from,' she said. Dairy farmers are grappling with low milk prices and high feed costs, said Rick Naerebout, chief executive of the Idaho Dairymen's Association. 'It's already a very difficult economic situation, and then to look at possibly losing 20 percent of your revenue for a period of two to four weeks—that's really adding a lot of anxiousness to the situation,' he said. Idaho barred the importation of cows from the Texas Panhandle after news of bird flu outbreak there, but a week too late. Having an infected herd in Idaho despite those precautions 'was kind of a gut shot,' Mr. Naerebout said. Matt Herrick, a spokesman for the International Dairy Foods Association, said that federal officials should provide more resources and equipment for farmers to protect themselves, and should publicize updates more widely, including through social media. There is no mention of the bird flu outbreak on the U.S.D.A.'s homepage. The last outbreak-related announcement from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a division of the department, is dated April 2. The U.S.D.A. is exploring vaccines to protect cattle from H5N1, but it is unclear how long it might take to develop them. Dr. Armstrong, of the University of Minnesota Extension, said many farmers and veterinarians hope the virus will 'burn itself out.' Instead, it may become a long-term problem.

{"id": "451", "title": "Bird flu virus now found in milk, is of \"great concern\" to WHO", "date": "2024-04-19", "fulltext": "A recent statement from the World Health Organization is sure to ruffle a few feathers. The international health group expressed \"great concern\" over the rising number of bird flu cases in humans. The organization also announced Friday that the virus has been found in raw milk. Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at the WHO, noted that the avian flu, also called H5N1, had an \"extremely high\" mortality rate among those who had been infected around the world. Avian flu has now been identified in raw milk, the WHO said Friday. panyawat - stock.adobe.com The illness remains extremely rare in the US, with just two known cases, one that occurred earlier this month and one that occurred in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In both of those cases, the infected individuals worked in close proximity to livestock. No human-to-human transmissions of the disease have occurred. \"The great concern, of course, is that - [the] virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,\" Farrar warned. On Friday, the WHO further warned that the virus has been found in raw milk. Officials said that drinking pasteurized milk - which is the kind sold throughout the US in grocery stores - is still safe. Dairy farmers in the US are also required to destroy milk from infected cows, so it should not make its way into the food supply chain in the first place. The WHO warned that the virus has been found in raw milk. Drinking pasteurized milk is still safe, officials said. 88studio - stock.adobe.com Dr. Wenqing Zhang, who leads the WHO's global flu program, said that the virus had been identified in a \"very high virus concentration in raw milk\" from infected cows, according to the Daily Mail. Researchers are still trying to determine how long the virus might be able to survive in milk. In general, drinking raw milk is always a bad idea, as raw milk can carry other contaminants, like salmonella, listeria and E. coli - all of which can make you sick. Cases of avian flu in humans remain very rare, with just two known infections identified in the US. ZUMAPRESS.com Zhang also reiterated the cases that have been identified in the US and in Europe have been relatively mild. There are two types of avian flu tracked by the CDC - low pathogenic and highly pathogenic. The latter, as you can probably guess, is more serious because it has a higher mortality rate in poultry, 90% - 100% and often within 48 hours. The person in Texas who contracted the illness earlier this month has the highly pathogenic form of the virus. Since January 2022, the CDC notes that over 90 million birds have been infected in 48 states. But the current outbreak isn't just affecting birds, it's affecting cattle as well. Currently, eight states have avian flu cattle outbreaks. The WHO urged US officials to monitor the situation closely because the virus could \"evolve into transmitting in different ways.\" Experts have warned of the potential for an avian flu pandemic for years, with some saying it could be \"100 times worse\" than COVID-19. REUTERS see also As bird flu spreads, the Biden admin remains dangerously unprepared for another pandemic \"Do the milking structures of cows create aerosols? Is it the environment which they're living in?

{"id": "452", "title": "WHO chief scientist calls for increased monitoring and preparation for highly pathogenic bird flu", "date": "2024-04-19", "fulltext": "(CNN) - The bird flu spreading through cattle in the United States is an 'enormous concern' the chief scientist of the World Health Organization said Thursday as he called for more tracking and preparation for the virus. So far, there is no evidence that the highly pathogenic H5N1 flu virus can spread from person to person. This flu strain was first detected in birds in 1996 and has primarily been a threat to farmed and wild fowl, but in the past two years, an increasing number of mammals have tested positive with the virus, indicating that the virus is looking for new hosts and moving closer to people. 'The great concern, of course, is that in doing so and infecting ducks and chickens - but now increasingly mammals - that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,' Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British medical researcher and chief scientist at WHO since 2023, told reporters on Thursday in Geneva. 'We have to watch, more than watch, we have to make sure that if H5N1 did come across to humans with human-to-human transmission that we were in a position to immediately respond with access equitably to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.' Farrar's comments came in a response to a question during a news conference about WHO's new definition for airborne pathogens. Though H5N1 doesn't spread from person to person, humans can catch it when they're exposed to infected animals. In the US, one person in Texas has tested positive for H5N1 this year. That person was working with cows when they tested positive, and it is believed they caught it from an infected cow. They are only the second documented case of human H5N1 in the United States. The first was in a poultry worker in Colorado in 2022. Though it doesn't spread easily to humans, researchers are worried about it because of how deadly these infections can be. Since 2003, 889 human cases and 463 deaths have been reported from 23 countries, giving this virus a case fatality rate of 52%, according to the WHO. 'This virus is a really scary virus. It's something I would hate to see in humans,' Dr. Richard Webby, director of the WHO's coordinating center for studies on the ecology of influenza and a scientist at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, told CNN. Webby, who has been studying H5N1 for 20 years, said even though this virus has never figured out how to efficiently make people sick, 'what's happening now there are lots more small mammals being infected with this virus and we've ever seen in the past 20, close to 25 years of monitoring, so that is absolutely concerning,' he said. Webby said H5N1 is more active now than it ever has been, but it still hasn't developed key mutations that scientists are worried about that could help it infect people. 'Because we haven't seen those changes does suggest to me that this virus has got quite a hurdle to overcome to become a real sort of human pathogen,' Webby said. So far in the United States, the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services has reported 29 infected herds in eight states - Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, South Dakota, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio and North Carolina. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that while the current risk to public health from H5N1 is low, it is monitoring the situation carefully. In an update posted to its situation summary on Thursday, the CDC said is studying the virus isolated from the recent human case in the US and found it to be susceptible to antiviral medications.

{"id": "453", "title": "WHO's top scientist sounds alarm about bird flu and need for vaccine development", "date": "2024-04-19", "fulltext": "World Health Organization's top scientist said this week the recent bird flu outbreak is of 'great concern' to public health, and vaccine development to halt the virus is 'not where we need to be.' The virus, known as Type A H5N1, which typically circulates among poultry and wild birds, has spread to mammals, including cows, cats and at least two people in the U.S. in recent years. The new development experts are eyeing is that the virus is now passing from mammal to mammal. Bird flu has a high mortality rate in the hundreds of people who've contracted it, Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at WHO, the United Nations health agency, told reporters on Thursday. Dairy cows, worker: Bird flu outbreak is an 'evolving situation.' Here's what to know about symptoms, spread. U.S. health officials say the country is ready to ramp up vaccine production if the risk of bird flu rises. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health remains low. 'It's too early to press the panic button,' Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University and a leading expert in global health, told USA TODAY. The nightmare scenario, he explained, is if the virus makes a genetic leap and begins human-to-human transmission. This would be worse than the COVID-19 pandemic given how infectious and deadly the virus is, he said. While no human-to-human transmission has occurred, Farrar, of WHO, expressed concern about recent U.S. cases showing bird flu cases among cattle in several states and a Texas dairy worker. The infection has started to become a pandemic among animal species, he said at a news conference. 'The great concern, of course, is that in doing so and infecting ducks and chickens, but now increasingly mammals that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans,' he said. 'And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission.' Farrar also flagged his concern that vaccine development is not 'where we need to be' and public health officials don't currently have the capability to diagnose H5N1. In a statement to USA TODAY, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response said its National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) program is equipped to respond rapidly to influenza strains as they evolve. 'NPIVS works closely with industry partners to make and test updated vaccines that match new strains of influenza viruses with pandemic potential as they emerge, while at the same time, supporting manufacturing capacity to allow for large-scale vaccine production if needed,' the statement said. There are two antigens that are 'well-matched' to the circulating strain of H5N1, the federal agency said. The agency said hundreds of thousands of doses of vaccine could be deployed within weeks, pending regulatory action by the Food and Drug Administration. Within months, federal officials could deploy more than 100 million doses. But Gostin, of Georgetown, said he doubts that's realistic. While the U.S. is comparatively better, the world lacks the capacity to ramp up hundreds of millions or billions of vaccines for a pandemic with bird flu. And even if the vaccine initially matches virus strains, the virus mutates quickly. He also noted that public health systems lack the ability for early detection and testing of bird flu. 'For many, many decades, these avian and swine influenzas have stayed within the animal kingdom,' Gostin said. 'The hope and the expectation is that it will continue to do that. But one day, that virus will mutate and go to a human, and then spread to a global pandemic very, very quickly. And we have to be ready for that day.' Bird flu in dairy cows in eight states, recent human case Eight states experienced recent bird flu outbreaks in dairy cows beginning in late March in Texas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture believes migratory birds were the source of the infection in cows. The virus then spread from herd to herd, experts believe, suggesting there has been transmission among mammals. Genomic sequencing of the viruses taken from infected cattle indicates this virus is not more transmissible to humans, the USDA said. On April 1, Texas health officials said a dairy worker was infected with bird flu after close contact with sick cows. The worker—the second person in the U.S. to get bird flu since 2022—had symptoms of conjunctivitis or eye redness. Bird flu spreads primarily through contact with infected birds, including sick or dead animals. Human cases are rare. Most occur in people who've had unprotected exposure to sick animals. The risk is heightened for people who work with infected poultry or livestock, and for veterinarians who treat infected animals. On Thursday, the WHO said it also updated its terms on airborne diseases for the next expected pandemic. Consulting with health agencies in the U.S., Africa, China and Europe, health officials are opting for 'infectious respiratory particles' instead of 'aerosols' or 'droplets' to avoid confusion about particle sizes, the U.N. said. This can better coordinate responses to respiratory pathogens, Farrar, of WHO, said. Karen Weintraub contributed to this report. The U.S. has seen dairy cows infected with bird flu across eight states, as one Texas dairy worker working among infected cattle also became sick.

{"id": "454", "title": "Lasers, Inflatable Dancers and the Fight to Fend Off Avian Flu", "date": "2024-04-20", "fulltext": "Some poultry growers are turning to innovative tactics to protect their flocks, deploying deterrents like drones, air horns, balloons and decoy predators. Loren Brey, a poultry grower in Minnesota, walked onto the farm where his egg-laying turkeys nest in November to discover a handful of hens, dead from the highly pathogenic avian flu. Within a week, he lost nearly half of his entire flock. So when Mr. Brey's turkeys began producing eggs again in the spring, he gave a seemingly unconventional prevention method a go: lasers installed atop his barns, firing beams of green light to fend off wild ducks, owls and other possible carriers of the deadly virus. As migratory birds fly north for the spring, poultry farmers and backyard keepers across the country are bracing for yet another outbreak of avian flu. Although the most recent strain has felled only a small portion of the nearly 10 billion chickens, turkeys, ducks and other birds sold across the country each year, some poultry growers like Mr. Brey are turning to innovative tactics to protect their flocks, deploying deterrents like drones, air horns, balloons and decoy predators. The practices underline the scramble by smaller farms and even some larger-scale operations to ward off the virus, as well as the fatigue, and begrudging acceptance, of the illness after years of sanitation protocols, lockdowns and debates over vaccination. The most affected appear to be large-scale industrial farms and those raising egg-producing chickens: two-thirds of the depopulated birds belong to just 30 farms with one million or more egg-laying hens. Turkey operations, like Mr. Brey's, have also been hit hard, representing 350 of the 481 commercial farms with detected cases. The birds are particularly susceptible to infection, and are more exposed to the virus because many turkey farms sit within the migratory path for many wild waterfowl, said Dr. Carol Cardona, an expert in avian health at the University of Minnesota. An infection carries vast consequences. Under federal policy, one infected bird can necessitate the culling or elimination of an entire flock, and then disposing of the carcasses through composting, burial, incineration or rendering. The regulation has resulted in 90 million dead birds and more than 1,100 affected flocks across the country since February 2022, when the strain, the most lethal yet in the United States, was first detected. Because areas where infected birds once lived must be disinfected and quarantined, and repopulating a flock takes time, production can be halted for months. As a result, the total number of egg-laying hens has declined by about seven million from 2021 to 2023, producing a billion fewer eggs a year and contributing to spikes in cost. Christian Alexandre, 32, who raises egg-laying chickens on 300 acres of grassland nestled between coastal redwoods and the Pacific Ocean near Crescent City, Calif., said it took half a year before production capacity was fully restored after bird flu was detected in late 2022. 'The toughest part for farmers is losing the birds, for sure. And then losing the work for your employees and not being able to supply your customers,' he said, adding that depopulating and composting the bodies afterward was traumatic. Mr. Alexandre collects eggs by hand from mobile coops with no doors and no floors to ensure the birds full access to the outdoors. Rather than restocking with newly hatched chicks and waiting months for them to grow, he instead bought 'spent' brown, organic hens, or layers that have reached the peak of their egg-producing days. Nearly 3 years old, the birds lay fewer eggs per day than younger hens, but Mr. Alexandre's farm is back to full capacity, producing 10,000 to 12,000 eggs a day. To prevent another outbreak, Mr. Alexandre now limits farm tours and sanitizes thoroughly, but he vowed to stick to his convictions. As president of the American Pastured Poultry Association, he said he was aware of only a handful of cases among his membership of 1,100 farmers. 'Am I afraid of getting it again? Not enough to lock my birds inside,' he said. Mr. Alexandre also tried installing lasers on his farm. But after a while, starlings began learning the lasers' patterns and no longer feared the lightsaber-like beams. Acknowledging that the deterrents were not foolproof, Craig Duhr, a sales manager for the Bird Control Group, which makes the lasers, said demand ticked up every time there was an outbreak. Dairy farmers, he said, were now seeking to install the system, which start at $12,500 per unit, since the disease was detected in cows last month. Other safeguards that farmers have turned to in a bid to ward off potentially deadly carriers, according to Dr. Cardona: netting, noise machines and inflatable dancers. 'Scary man, you know, the dudes that blow up,' she said. But she emphasized that the seasonality and evolving nature of the virus meant that farmers should regularly enhance safety measures. 'It's like sprints, like reps. You do a sprint. And then you rest. Then you sprint again,' Dr. Cardona said. 'You use that rest time to build your resiliency and make sure you're ready for the next season. And then you hope and pray.' To build that resiliency, experts and officials recommend following certain protocols: minimizing visitors, cleaning and disinfecting vigorously, keeping water and feed away from wild birds and mammals, and isolating newly purchased birds or those returning from crowds, among others. Still, the avian flu can sneak into the most stringently locked-down coops. Mr. Brey, for one, has a designated parking spot for anyone coming in contact with his turkeys, Danish entry systems where people can clean and disinfect themselves and filtered air inlets. 'You can tighten and tighten up your biosecurity until you're blue in the face. Like, what time is it now? Three o'clock? I'm on my eighth shower today already,' said Mr. Brey, who has been raising birds for three decades. That constant vigilance has strained the patience of some poultry farmers. Samantha Gasson, who raises 2,000 broiler chickens — those grown for meat — and 400 turkeys on pasture in North Carolina, has followed standard protocols and flies drones to stave off vultures, which can carry the virus and circle her lambs and cows. But after years of worrying about the virus, she has now learned to cope with it, comparing her response to burnout from the pandemic. 'With Covid, in the beginning, I was definitely one of those people who masked up and gave everybody 20 feet,' said Ms. Gasson, who works for an animal welfare and food safety nonprofit. 'And with the flu, it was the same thing. In that first year, I definitely lost sleep over it. Since then, it's just like OK, it's a part of life.' Rachael Arestad used to scan the federal case tracker that monitors the spread of avian flu almost daily when the current strain confined her 18 chickens inside their pink, home-built coop in her backyard in rural Connecticut. Two years in, her watchfulness has waned. Ms. Arestad will still periodically check to see if the virus has been detected close by, avoid dog parks covered in geese droppings and tie balloons in her yard to scare off foxes, which may bring the virus or attack her birds. But the thought of keeping her chickens, whom she considers pets, in perpetual lockdown is unappealing. 'I just hope at some point in the future, they'll offer a vaccine for backyard chicken people,' she said. 'We're not selling our chickens overseas, right? We just want to see happy, healthy flocks.' Mr. Brey, who also serves as the president of the Minnesota Turkey Research and Promotion Council, sounded a note of resignation when it came to properly warding off the bird flu. 'You lay awake in bed for days and days, like, how in the world?' he added. 'Now, how, what should I do different? I don't know that answer.'", "media_outlet": "NYTimes", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The birds are particularly susceptible to infection, and are more exposed to the virus because many turkey farms sit within the migratory path for many wild waterfowl, said Dr. Carol Cardona, an expert in avian health at the University of Minnesota.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "But she emphasized that the seasonality and evolving nature of the virus meant that farmers should regularly enhance safety measures.", "affirm_why_count": 2, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "But after years of worrying about the virus, she has now learned to cope with it, comparing her response to burnout from the pandemic.", "affirm_keywords_statement_2": "'With Covid, in the beginning, I was definitely one of those people who masked up and gave everybody 20 feet,' said Ms. Gasson, who works for an animal welfare and food safety nonprofit.", "affirm_keywords_count": 2, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_count": 0, "deny_keywords_statement_1": "But after years of worrying about the virus, she has now learned to cope with it, comparing her response to burnout from the pandemic.", "deny_keywords_count": 1}
{"id": "455", "title": "Bird Flu Is Infecting More Mammals. What Does That Mean for Us?", "date": "2024-04-22", "fulltext": "In her three decades of working with elephant seals, Dr. Marcela Uhart had never seen anything like the scene on the beaches of Argentina's Valdés Peninsula last October. It was peak breeding season; the beach should have been teeming with harems of fertile females and enormous males battling one another for dominance. Instead, it was 'just carcass upon carcass upon carcass,' recalled Dr. Uhart, who directs the Latin American wildlife health program at the University of California, Davis. H5N1, one of the many viruses that cause bird flu, had already killed at least 24,000 South American sea lions along the continent's coasts in less than a year. Now it had come for elephant seals. Pups of all ages, from newborns to the fully weaned, lay dead or dying at the high-tide line. Sick pups lay listless, foam oozing from their mouths and noses. Dr. Uhart called it 'an image from hell.' In the weeks that followed, she and a colleague 'protected head to toe with gloves, gowns and masks, and periodically dousing themselves with bleach' carefully documented the devastation. Team members stood atop the nearby cliffs, assessing the toll with drones. What they found was staggering: The virus had killed an estimated 17,400 seal pups, more than 95 percent of the colony's young animals. The catastrophe was the latest in a bird flu epidemic that has whipped around the world since 2020, prompting authorities on multiple continents to kill poultry and other birds by the millions. In the United States alone, more than 90 million birds have been culled in a futile attempt to deter the virus. There has been no stopping H5N1. Avian flu viruses tend to be picky about their hosts, typically sticking to one kind of wild bird. But this one has rapidly infiltrated an astonishingly wide array of birds and animals, from squirrels and skunks to bottlenose dolphins, polar bears and, most recently, dairy cows. 'In my flu career, we have not seen a virus that expands its host range quite like this,' said Troy Sutton, a virologist who studies avian and human influenza viruses at Penn State University. The blow to sea mammals, and to dairy and poultry industries, is worrying enough. But a bigger concern, experts said, is what these developments portend: The virus is adapting to mammals, edging closer to spreading among people. A human pandemic is by no means inevitable. So far at least, the changes in the virus do not signal that H5N1 can cause a pandemic, Dr. Sutton said. Still, he said, 'we really don't know how to interpret this or what it means.' Marine mortalities A highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 was identified in 1996 in domestic waterfowl in China. The next year, 18 people in Hong Kong became infected with the virus, and six died. The virus then went silent, but it resurfaced in Hong Kong in 2003. Since then, it has caused dozens of outbreaks in poultry and affected more than 800 people who were in close contact with the birds. All the while, it continued to evolve. The version of H5N1 currently racing across the world emerged in Europe in 2020 and spread quickly to Africa and Asia. It killed scores of farmed birds, but unlike its predecessors it also spread widely among wild birds and into many other animals. Most infections of mammals were probably 'dead-end' cases: a fox, perhaps, that ate an infected bird and died without passing on the virus. But a few larger outbreaks suggested that H5N1 was capable of more. The first clue came in the summer of 2022, when the virus killed hundreds of seals in New England and Quebec. A few months later, it infiltrated a mink farm in Spain. In the mink, at least, the most likely explanation was that H5N1 had adapted to spread among the animals. The scale of the outbreaks in sea mammals in South America underscored that probability. 'Even intuitively, I would think that mammal-to-mammal transmission is very likely,' said Malik Peiris, a virologist and expert in bird flu at the University of Hong Kong. After it was first detected in South America, in birds in Colombia in October 2022, the virus swept down the Pacific coast to Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the continent, and up the Atlantic coast. Along the way, it killed hundreds of thousands of seabirds, and tens of thousands of sea lions, in Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. The sea lions behaved erratically, experiencing convulsions and paralysis; pregnant females miscarried their fetuses. 'What happened when the virus moved to South America we had never seen before,' Dr. Uhart said. Exactly how and when the virus jumped to marine mammals is unclear, but the sea lions most likely came into close contact with infected birds or contaminated droppings. (Although fish make up the bulk of sea lions' diet, they do sometimes eat birds.) At some point, it's likely the virus evolved to spread directly among the marine mammals: In Argentina, the sea lion deaths did not coincide with the mass mortality of wild birds. 'This could suggest that the infection source was not the infected birds,' said Dr. Pablo Plaza, a wildlife veterinarian at the National University of Comahue and National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina. It is not hard to imagine how the virus might disperse in these animals: Elephant seals and sea lions both breed in colonies, crowding together on beaches where they fight, mate and bark at one another. Elephant seals sneeze all day, dispersing large droplets of mucus each time they do. It is difficult to prove exactly how and when the virus moved from one species to another. But genetic analysis supports the theory the marine mammals acquired their infections from one another, not birds. Samples of virus isolated from sea lions in Peru and Chile and from the elephant seals in Argentina all share about 15 mutations not seen in the birds; the same mutations were also present in a Chilean man who was infected last year. There are numerous opportunities for H5N1 to jump from sea mammals into people. One sick male elephant seal that sat for a day and a half on a public beach in Argentina turned out to carry enormous amounts of virus. In Peru, scientists collected samples from sea lion carcasses that lay alongside families enjoying a beach day. Scavenging animals, such as dogs, could also pick up the virus from an infected carcass and then spread it more broadly: 'None of the wildlife exists in their little silos,' said Wendy Puryear, a virologist at Tufts University who studied the New England seal outbreaks. In some South American countries, apart from a few carcasses that were buried, the rest have remained on the beaches, rotting and scavenged upon. 'How do you even scale up to remove 17,000 dead bodies out in the middle of nowhere, places where you can't even bring down machinery, and humongous cliffs?' Dr. Uhart said. A mutating pathogen Flu viruses are adept at picking up new mutations; when two types of flu virus infect the same animal, they can shuffle their genetic material and generate new versions. It is unclear exactly how, and how much, the H5N1 virus has changed since it first emerged. One study last year showed that after the virus entered the United States, it quickly mixed with other flu viruses circulating here and morphed into various versions 'some mild, others causing severe neurological symptoms. 'So now after 20 years of reassortment, you have a virus that actually does extraordinary well in a whole variety of avian and mammal species,' said Vincent Munster, a virologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has studied the mutations needed for H5N1 to adapt to people. Every new species that harbors the virus creates opportunities for H5N1 to continue to evolve, and to jump into people. And the virus may stumble across mutations that no one has yet considered, allowing it to breach the species barrier. That is what happened in the 2009 swine flu outbreak. That virus did not have the mutations thought to be needed to infect people easily. Instead, 'it had these other mutations that no one knew about or thought about before then,' said Louise Moncla, an evolutionary biologist who studies avian influenza at the University of Pennsylvania. Still, even if the virus jumps to people, 'we may not see the level of mortality that we're really concerned about,' said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University. 'Preexisting immunity to seasonal flu strains will provide some protection from severe disease.' What happens next The U.S. is prepared for an influenza pandemic, with some stockpiled vaccines and antivirals, but its efforts at monitoring the virus may not pick it up quickly enough to deploy those tools. It took several weeks before farmers, and then officials, knew that H5N1 was circulating in dairy cows. The dairy farm outbreak has resulted in only one mild human infection, but farms are fertile ground for the virus to jump species 'from cat to cow to pig and human, in any order. Many scientists worry in particular about pigs, which are susceptible to both human and avian flu strains, providing the perfect mixing bowl for viruses to swap genes. Pigs are slaughtered when very young, and newer generations, with no prior exposure to flu, are particularly vulnerable to infections. So far, H5N1 does not seem adept at infecting pigs, but that could change as it acquires new mutations. 'I never let my kids go to a state fair or animal farm, I'm one of those parents,' Dr. Lakdawala said. 'And it's mostly because I know that the number of interactions that we increase with animals, the more opportunities there are.' Should H5N1 adapt to people, federal officials will need to work together and with their international counterparts. Nationalism, competition and bureaucracy can all slow down the exchange of information that is crucial in a developing outbreak. In some ways, the current spread among dairy cows is an opportunity to practice the drill, said Rick Bright, the chief executive of Bright Global Health, a consulting company that focuses on improving responses to public health emergencies. But the U.S. Agriculture Department has been too limited in its approach to testing cows, and has not been as timely and transparent with its findings as it should have been, he said. On Wednesday, the department ordered that dairy cows moving across state lines to be tested for influenza. Dr. Rosemary Sifford, the department's chief veterinarian, said the staff there were working hard to share information as quickly as they can. 'This is considered an emerging disease,' she said. Government leaders are typically cautious, wanting to see more data. But 'given the rapid speed at which this can spread and the devastating illness that it can cause if our leaders are hesitant and don't pull the right triggers at the right time, we will be caught flat-footed once again,' Dr. Bright said.

Access to the 239 genetic sequences will help scientists assess whether the dangerous virus has acquired mutations that might make it easier for it to spread to and among mammals, and whether additional changes have been seen as it moves from cow to cow and herd to herd. In addition to virus sequences from cattle, the trove includes sequences of viruses retrieved from cats, chickens, a skunk, a raccoon, a grackle, a blackbird, and a goose, the agency said. Rick Bright, a pandemic planning consultant who has been vocally critical of the USDA for being slow to share sequence data, noted the disclosure had 'taken a long time.' 'But I'm grateful,' he said of the government's move. 'And eager to see what we can discover.' NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy 'I just hope that data keeps coming,' said Bright, a former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the former head of the Rockefeller Foundation's now-defunct Pandemic Prevention Institute. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, said that at present what has been posted is raw data, which is highly useful, but will take some time to analyze. 'At least now, servers around the world [run by] groups who work on this can start revving up their engines,' he told STAT. Worobey said it was not quickly evident if the sequences were from samples collected across various time points in the outbreak, which has been ongoing for weeks. The USDA announced on March 25 that it had confirmed H5N1 in dairy cows in Texas, a finding that has unsettled scientists who have followed this virus' progression across the globe and into species after species of mammals. Until now, cows have not been among the animals seen to be infected by the virus. Trending Now: As the second surge looms, systems issues not 'weary staff' should be the focus for hospital safety The department initially shared a number of sequences, all of which appeared to be from the original outbreak in Texas. Since then, 32 herds in eight states have been confirmed to have been infected with H5N1. While it is deadly to poultry and to a number of types of mammals, in cows it does not appear to cause severe illness. But milk production declines in infected cows and the milk produced is thick, off-color, and teeming with H5N1 viruses. Farmers have been told to destroy milk from infected cows. While the USDA believes the virus is spreading from cow to cow, it is as yet uncertain how it is transmitting, noting there doesn't appear to be large amounts of virus in the nasal passages of infected animals.

{"id": "457", "title": "Remnants of bird flu virus found in pasteurized milk, FDA says", "date": "2024-04-23", "fulltext": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that samples of pasteurized milk had tested positive for remnants of the bird flu virus that has infected dairy cows. The agency stressed that the material is inactivated and that the findings do not represent actual virus that may be a risk to consumers. Officials added that they're continuing to study the issue. To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe, the FDA said in a statement. The announcement comes nearly a month after an avian influenza virus that has sickened millions of wild and commercial birds in recent years was detected in dairy cows in at least eight states. The Agriculture Department says 33 herds have been affected to date. FDA officials didn't indicate how many samples they tested or where they were obtained. The agency has been evaluating milk during processing and from grocery stores, officials said. Results of additional tests are expected in the next few days to weeks. The PCR lab test the FDA used would have detected viral genetic material even after live virus was killed by pasteurization, or heat treatment, said Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University. There is no evidence to date that this is infectious virus and the FDA is following up on that, Jaykus said. Officials with the FDA and the USDA had previously said milk from affected cattle did not enter the commercial supply. Milk from sick animals is supposed to be diverted and destroyed. Federal regulations require milk that enters interstate commerce to be pasteurized. Because the detection of the bird flu virus known as Type A H5N1 in dairy cattle is new and the situation is evolving, no studies on the effects of pasteurization on the virus have been completed, FDA officials said. But past research shows that pasteurization is very likely to inactivate heat-sensitive viruses like H5N1, the agency added. Matt Herrick, a spokesman for the International Dairy Foods Association, said that time and temperature regulations for pasteurization ensure that the commercial U.S. milk supply is safe. Remnants of the virus have zero impact on human health, he wrote in an email. Scientists confirmed the H5N1 virus in dairy cows in March after weeks of reports that cows in Texas were suffering from a mysterious malady. The cows were lethargic and saw a dramatic reduction in milk production. Although the H5N1 virus is lethal to commercial poultry, most infected cattle seem to recover within two weeks, experts said. To date, two people in U.S. have been infected with bird flu. A Texas dairy worker who was in close contact with an infected cow recently developed a mild eye infection and has recovered. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a Colorado poultry farm. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Science and Educational Media Group.

{"id": "458", "title": "Fragments of Bird Flu Virus Discovered in Milk", "date": "2024-04-23", "fulltext": "The milk poses virtually no risk to consumers, experts said. But the finding suggests that the outbreak in dairy cows is wider than has been known. Federal regulators said on Tuesday that samples of pasteurized milk from around the country had tested positive for inactive remnants of the bird flu virus that has been infecting dairy cows. The viral fragments do not pose a threat to consumers, officials said. 'To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,' the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement. Over the last month, a bird flu virus known as H5N1 has been detected in more than 30 dairy herds in eight states. The virus is also known to have infected one farmworker, whose only symptom was pink eye. Scientists have been critical of the federal response, saying that the Agriculture Department has been too slow to share important data and has not adequately pursued the testing of cattle for the infection. Finding viral fragments in milk from the commercial supply chain is not ideal, but the genetic material poses little risk to consumers who drink milk, said David O'Connor, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 'The risk of getting infected from milk that has viral fragments in it should be nil,' he said. 'The genetic material can't replicate on its own.' Officials did not say how many samples of pasteurized milk had tested positive for viral fragments or where those samples had come from. Those are key questions, experts said. A minority of the samples tested positive, according to two people with knowledge of the data who were not authorized to speak publicly. If the fragments are present in many samples throughout the commercial milk supply, it would suggest that the outbreak is likely to be far more widespread than has been believed. Last week, The New York Times reported that the virus had also been detected in a herd of North Carolina dairy cows that had no symptoms of illness. 'The problem in dairy cows might be much bigger than we know,' Dr. O'Connor said. 'That would be the concern—not that the milk itself would be a risk.' The F.D.A. said that it was studying milk samples from several sources, including infected cows, the milk processing chain and grocery store shelves. Federal officials are still waiting for results from experiments designed to determine whether the milk samples might contain active virus, according to two people familiar with ongoing federal reviews. Those tests take much longer than so-called PCR tests that determine whether there is viral material in the milk supply. Federal officials have repeatedly reassured consumers that the commercial milk supply is safe, noting that dairy producers are required to keep milk from sick animals out of the human food supply. Nearly all of the milk produced on U.S. farms is pasteurized, a process that is designed to kill pathogens with heat. Pasteurization should also inactivate flu viruses, which are known to be fragile and heat-sensitive, experts said. Only recently has the F.D.A. been testing pasteurization's effectiveness on H5N1. The risk of contracting the virus from unpasteurized milk products remains unknown, but regulators have long cautioned consumers that raw milk poses a variety of disease risks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been monitoring flu testing data and flu-related emergency room visits. 'We have not seen anything elevated to date at the local, state or national level,' said Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the agency. The discovery of viral fragments in milk has prompted significant concern in the White House over how to avoid raising undue alarm about the dairy supply, according to people familiar with internal deliberations who were not authorized to speak publicly. Federal officials are expected to address the findings in a news briefing in the coming days. Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, an advocacy organization, said that it would be 'very critical' for officials to clearly communicate the findings and educate consumers about what they mean. Milk from farms is already pooled into thousands of gallons that would greatly dilute any virus present. Pasteurization further slashes levels of the virus present. Soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, helped the federal government plan for a possible bioterrorism attack that might use botulism neurotoxin, a highly lethal pathogen, to contaminate milk. Working with the dairy industry, he and others identified pasteurization conditions that would inactivate the neurotoxin. That experience reassures him that H5N1 is highly unlikely to pose any problems, Dr. Osterholm said. 'With a virus like this, I would have to believe even if you had the highest levels of virus activity you could ever imagine in the actual milk from the udder of an infected cow, it would be diluted millions of times over going into pasteurization.' Ingested milk is also broken down by the body's digestive and immune systems, so 'I wouldn't worry about remnants,' said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, director of the Boston University Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases. 'As long as it's not a live virus, it is unlikely that there's any health risks,' she said. Infected people and cows might carry remnants of viral genetic material long after the active infection has resolved. That is why PCR tests for Covid sometimes produce positive results after a person has recovered from illness. The affected cows seem to have large amounts of virus in their milk, suggesting that it might take some time to become virus-free, Dr. Bhadelia said.

{"id": "459", "title": "Scientists say USDA is sharing too little data too slowly on H5N1 flu", "date": "2024-04-23", "fulltext": "(CNN) - When the US Department of Agriculture announced late Sunday that it had publicly posted new data from its investigation into a bird flu outbreak in cattle, scientists eagerly searched a well-known platform used globally to share the genetic sequences of viruses. The sequences weren't there. As of Tuesday morning, they still aren't. Researchers looking to track the evolution and spread of H5N1 say the information that was posted - raw data on a US server - isn't very useful and is anything but transparent. They also say the government's release of information in the outbreak, which was confirmed in cattle almost a month ago, has been painfully slow. After Sunday's announcement by the USDA, Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and vaccine researcher who led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority from 2016 to 2020, said he immediately called his contacts at the database, called the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, or GISAID, to make sure he wasn't missing something. 'I said Look, just tell me: Do you have data?' and they said 'No,' Bright said. After checking even parts of the database where people can post rough drafts of sequences prior to full public release, Dr. Lucas Freitas, a Brazilian data scientist who is the GISAID curation lead, confirmed there are no new sequences posted by the USDA since its announcement. 'We wouldn't miss it,' said Peter Bogner, founder and president of GISAID. 'H5 is the reason GISAID came about to begin with. It raises antennas.' The highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 has decimated bird populations around the world, and in recent years, has moved into a growing variety of mammals, raising concern that it's a step closer to becoming a virus that can spread efficiently in people. When the USDA confirmed that H5N1 had been detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas on March 25, the news put infectious disease experts on alert, and they were eager to get more information to see how the virus had changed to target a new host. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, says H5N1 has now been found in 32 herds in eight states. But weeks have gone by, and little data on the US outbreak has been shared with the global scientific community. In its notice posted Sunday, APHIS said it had shared 239 genetic sequences from the H5N1 outbreak 'from cattle, cats, chickens, skunk, racoon, grackle, blackbird, and goose.' The agency said it 'routinely publishes' on GISAID, but in the interest of public transparency and 'ensuring the scientific community has access to this information as quickly as possible -' it was 'also rapidly sharing' sequences to a US database maintained by the National Library of Medicine. The announcement suggested to many scientists that the information would be found in GISAID, which has been critical to tracking the evolution of the virus that causes Covid-19 as it moves around the world. Many countries, including the United States, use GISAID to quickly share genetic sequences - the exact order of four chemical building blocks that make up the blueprints of each virus. Instead, the USDA uploaded raw sequencing data, called FASTQ files, to the National Library of Medicine database, which is available to the public. These FASTQ files, however, lack the critical information necessary to help scientists track the evolution of the virus, such as the exact date the sample was collected and what state it came from. Scientists do use raw data when tracking the evolution of a virus, but they also typically use it in concert with the type of information that is typically posted to GISAID: consensus sequences, known as FASTA files, which have been refined and cleared of contamination and mistakes. Consensus sequences typically give more information about where the sample was collected and when, helping researchers better understand how a virus is changing over time. Researchers say it's not clear how recently the samples that are the basis for the raw data were taken. The only dates posted say '2024,' and the locations are only listed as 'USA.' There's no information on how the samples were obtained - whether they come from swabs of an animal's respiratory tract its skin, or somewhere else. In response to emailed questions from CNN, Shilo Weir, a public affairs specialist for USDA, said the agency had posted the raw data to the US server in the interest of speed and said the agency would work quickly to get curated sequences to GISAID. 'APHIS typically posts curated sequence data on the GISAID platform. However, in order to make sequence data public as soon as possible, APHIS uploaded these unanalyzed sequence data files to NCBI,' Weir wrote in the emailed response. 'These sequences will not be curated before posting, but this approach will allow us the most rapid path to posting sequence information. APHIS will continue to work as quickly as possible to publish to GISAID curated files that incorporate and analyze relevant epidemiologic information along with the sequence data,' Weir said. It's also not clear whether the latest release represents all the genomes the agency has. Dr. Michael Worobey, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, said the USDA was making a mistake by not sharing all the information it has as quickly as possible. 'There's a whole community around the world of people like me and my colleagues, who have a lot of experience with this and often can see things or do analyses that might show something that others have missed,' Worobey said. 'You don't want essentially one group to be the only ones looking at the data. You want everyone, all the experts around the world to be able to do that,' Worobey added. Dr. Tom Inglesby, who directs the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, said USDA's public release of the raw data was a step in the right direction, but it didn't go far enough. 'The additional information would be quite useful for the public and for scientists and public health agencies, research organizations to understand all of the data that has been collected so far, what farms have been tested, when they were tested, what the sampling strategy is, overall, what kind of testing is going on now, around the country,' he said. 'Now that we know that there are asymptomatic cows that have tested positive, what's the strategy to understand the extent to which cows are infected that don't have symptoms in other herds? Because I think the most important objective here is to get a full picture of the outbreak.' Influenza viruses change quickly and have caused some of the most devastating pandemics throughout history. 'What we're seeing right now is chapter one of the book that keeps people like me and many infectious disease epidemiologists up at night,' said Dr. Michael Mina, who is chief scientific officer of the telehealth company eMed and an expert in the epidemiology, immunology and spread of infectious disease. The Covid pandemic was bad, but Mina said a pandemic caused by this virus could be worse. 'The genie is not out of the bottle yet, and that's a good thing,' Mina said, but given the potential consequences of letting the virus spread unchecked, 'It's a little bit hard to suggest we could be doing too much right now.' Scientists have followed H5N1 for roughly two decades as it ripped through populations of wild and domestic birds and more recently marine mammals like sea lions, but human-to-human spread after contact with animals has been sporadic and not sustained, suggesting the virus has not mutated enough to become a fully human pathogen. There's been no evidence of person-to-person spread in the current US outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Humans have been infected after contact with animals, however - a chilling reminder that the virus still has us in its sights and requires close monitoring. 'It's so critical that the US government is being as transparent as they can right now, overly transparent, and sharing all of these sequences and all of this data so the world can look at it and make their own risk assessments and start making their own vaccine if they need to in their own countries instead of waiting for the United States to say what's good and what's bad,' said Bright, who is CEO of Bright Global Health in Washington, DC. 'What would we say if this particular virus did get out of control?' Bright said. 'Would we look back on this last two or three months and say: I wish we would have done something else; I wish we would have been more transparent; I wish we would have shared all these sequences so the world can get ready for this?'\"}", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_3": "The Covid pandemic was bad, but Mina said a pandemic caused by this virus could be worse.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 has decimated bird populations around the world, and in recent years, has moved into a growing variety of mammals, raising concern that it's a step closer to becoming a virus that can spread efficiently in people.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Influenza viruses change quickly and have caused some of the most devastating pandemics throughout history.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "Scientists have followed H5N1 for roughly two decades as it ripped through populations of wild and domestic birds and more recently marine mammals like sea lions, but human-to-human spread after contact with animals has been sporadic and not sustained, suggesting the virus has not mutated enough to become a fully human pathogen.", "affirm_why_statement_4": "Humans have been infected after contact with animals, however - a chilling reminder that the virus still has us in its sights and requires close monitoring.", "affirm_why_count": 4, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "The announcement suggested to many scientists that the information would be found in GISAID, which has been critical to tracking the evolution of the virus that causes Covid-19 as it moves around the world.", "affirm_keywords_count": 1, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "human-to-human spread after contact with animals has been sporadic and not sustained, suggesting the virus has not mutated enough to become a fully human pathogen.", "deny_transmissible_count": 1, "deny_why_statement_1": "Human-to-human spread after contact with animals has been sporadic and not sustained, suggesting the virus has not mutated enough to become a fully human pathogen.", "deny_why_statement_2": "There's been no evidence of person-to-person spread in the current US outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "deny_why_count": 2, "deny_keywords_statement_1": "The Covid pandemic was bad, but Mina said a pandemic caused by this virus could be worse.", "deny_keywords_statement_2": "Influenza viruses change quickly and have caused some of the most devastating pandemics throughout history.", "deny_keywords_statement_3": "The announcement suggested to many scientists that the information would be found in GISAID, which has been critical to tracking the evolution of the virus that causes Covid-19 as it moves around the world.", "deny_keywords_count": 3}
{"id": "460", "title": "FDA finds traces of H5N1 bird flu viruses in grocery store milk but says pasteurized dairy products are", "date": "2024-04-23", "fulltext": "(CNN) - The US Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it had detected viral particles of H5N1 avian influenza in milk purchased at grocery stores, but the agency says it still believes that the milk is safe to drink. In an update about an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in cattle, the FDA noted that it believes the viral particles were detected by highly sensitive lab tests and are likely to have been remnants of viruses killed during the pasteurization process. The agency said that it does not think it is likely that the particles would be able to infect people but it is conducting additional tests to be completely sure. The FDA said these egg inoculation tests are 'a gold-standard' for determining whether a virus is still viable and able to infect people. 'To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe. Results from multiple studies will be made available in the next few days to weeks,' the agency said. Dr. Eric Topol, founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the finding of viral particles in milk on grocery store shelves means the outbreak is probably more widespread than we've known. 'The dissemination to cows is far greater than we have been led to believe,' Topol said in an email Tuesday. 'The FDA assurance that the dairy supply is safe is nice, but it's not based on extensive assessment yet, which they acknowledge, and won't engender trust and confidence because it comes in the wake of USDA mishandling,' he added. The US Department of Agriculture confirmed in late March that it had detected highly pathogenic avian influenza in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas, which was the first time a virus that has been decimating bird populations around the globe had shown up in cattle. Since then, infected cows have been confirmed in more than 30 farms across eight states. Scientists have said the USDA is sharing too little information about the virus and too slowly. The infected cows stopped eating as much as they usually did, and their milk became thickened and discolored. Veterinarians running tests on the animals found that the milk was teeming with the virus, although samples from their lungs didn't show much evidence of infection, leading the doctors to believe that the animals' mammary glands were directly infected, perhaps through shared milking equipment. Researchers are still trying to determine how cows initially became infected and how the virus is spreading between animals. Cats that have lived on the same farms as infected cows have died, perhaps after exposure to their milk. The FDA said Tuesday that milk from sick cows is being 'diverted or destroyed,' while milk sold in interstate commerce is being pasteurized, a process that heats it briefly to kill microbes. 'Even if virus is detected in raw milk, pasteurization is generally expected to eliminate pathogens to a level that does not pose a risk to consumer health,' the FDA stated. The agency said 99% of milk in the commercial supply comes from farms that follow the pasteurized milk ordinance, 'which includes controls that help ensure the safety of dairy products.' However, it noted that pasteurization doesn't render milk completely sterile. For that reason, it has been running tests on milk samples collected at grocery stores across the country. It is also collaborating with the food safety group at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA has long recommended that consumers not drink unpasteurized or raw milk because of the possibility that it may harbor germs that can pose serious health risks. So far, efforts to track the spread of the current outbreak have relied on voluntary reporting. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service keeps a list of diseases that are required to be reported in animals. Although avian influenza, or bird flu, is required to be reported in poultry and wild birds, reporting is not required in cattle. 'No one ever thought it was going to be in cows,' said Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's coordinating center for studies on the ecology of influenza at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital. 'You wouldn't even think of an H5N1 in cows being something you'd ever have to worry about, and I think that's where it's fallen through the cracks a little bit.' Not only does the USDA require reporting of H5N1 in poultry, it rewards producers for reporting at the first sign of illness in their flock and financially compensates them for birds and eggs that are destroyed to contain an outbreak. This approach has encouraged farmers to be forthcoming with information, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. There are no such policies in place to encourage reporting in other livestock. Osterholm said his major worry is that the outbreak could spread to pigs, since farms that keep cows often keep other types of animals, too. Flu viruses enter cells through sialic acids, which serve as entry points. Right now, the H5N1 virus hasn't learned to efficiently access the human version of the sialic acid receptor. Pigs have the same sialic acid receptors as both birds and humans in their respiratory tracts. If H5N1 causes a large outbreak in pigs, Osterholm said, it would give the virus a perfect opportunity to learn to attach to human sialic acids. 'Pigs are a more efficient mixing bowl,' said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics, molecular virology and microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. 'The one thing about where we are in Texas is that, in addition to those cattle, Texas is the epicenter of the feral hog population.' 'In the United States, we have 30% of the nation's feral hogs, 2 to 3 million feral hogs, and so that to me is a potential risk, as well,' he said. The USDA said it has encouraged farmers and ranchers to report cases of sick cattle to state animal health officials. But neither cows nor the people who work or live around them are being widely screened for the infection, which would require informed consent. Testing of wastewater in areas with outbreaks is also being discussed. Instead, the CDC is monitoring emergency department data and flu testing data in areas where H5N1 viruses have been detected in dairy cattle for any unusual trends in flu-like illness, flu or conjunctivitis. 'So far, these data remain in expected ranges, and to date, surveillance systems do not show any unusual trends or activity,' according to information in a statement compiled by officials at the CDC.

The genetic data point to a single spillover event that probably occurred in late 2023, Michael Worobey, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Arizona, told STAT on Tuesday. \"The bad news is it looks like this is well entrenched and has been in cattle for a long time and ... probably very, very, very widespread,\" said Worobey, who worked on the analysis with a number of scientists in the U.S. and Europe. He suggested the outbreak needs to be taken more seriously than it has been until now, especially given the amount of exposure humans have with cattle. \"We need to just study the hell out of it for starters ... and see if we can close the gap on what is happening and what we know.\" NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy Though there were reports of a mysterious illness affecting dairy cows in Texas as early as February, the USDA first confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 in dairy cows in that state in late March. Since then, the number of confirmed outbreaks has climbed to 33 herds in eight states. One person a farm worker who developed conjunctivitis has been confirmed to have been infected. The USDA has been unclear about whether these outbreaks are all linked the result of the movement of cattle, farm equipment, or workers or whether there have been multiple spillover events where infected wild birds have transmitted the virus to cows. Last week, it told STAT it could find links between the infected herds in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico; it is also known that cows in the first infected Michigan herd detected had been brought in from Texas. But USDA hasn't been able to draw a line between those outbreaks and others in Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Dakota. The genetic sequences cluster too closely for this to be anything other than a single spillover, Worobey said. \"If it were jumping from bird to cattle over and over again ... I wouldn't think you would just get this same very reduced genetic diversity where each of the internal segments are showing the same pattern.\" Related: H5N1 bird flu virus particles found in pasteurized milk but FDA says commercial milk supply appears safe The prospect of an outbreak that has been underway for months longer than had been previously known is not reassuring to those who follow the dangerous H5N1 virus. \"If that's true, it's been flying under the radar for a really embarrassingly, frustratingly long time,\" Worobey said. \"And we have no idea how much it's spreading asymptomatically and how widespread it is. And we're trying to deal with something long after the horse has bolted.\" Tom Peacock, an influenza virologist at the Pirbright Institute, a British organization that focuses on controlling viral illnesses in animals, concurred with Worobey's read of the data. Related: USDA releases H5N1 bird flu genetic data eagerly awaited by scientists The USDA has previously reported that it believed that virus from an infected cattle herd had found its way into a nearby chicken operation in Michigan. The genetic sequences for cows, poultry, and other infected species that were released by the USDA suggest that hypothesis is correct, Peacock said. \"If you look at all the cattle sequences together, they all cluster, as do the cats and the chickens and the grackles and stuff.\" \"The thing that doesn't fit that picture is the human case,\" he said. The genetic sequence from the human case, which occurred on an unidentified farm in Texas, is sufficiently different from the cattle sequences that it can't be easily linked to them, he said. The differences suggest that the individual was either infected in a separate event maybe not via a cow, but through contact with infected wild birds or that there might have been another line of viruses in cattle early on and it has since died out. \"It's basically too distant a cousin to be connected directly to this outbreak, which either means it's a second spillover or there was an early bifurcation of the cattle sequences,\" Peacock said. The 239 genetic sequences the USDA shared on Sunday did not include what's known as metadata information on where the sample that generated the sequence was taken, what part of the body of the infected animal it was taken from, or when precisely the collection occurred. They simply state \"USA\" and \"2024,\" which limits how well outside scientists can interpret what they are seeing. Peacock said it would have been helpful to know whether any of the cattle sequences had been generated from samples taken on the farm where the infected worker was thought to have been exposed to the virus. But that information is not available. Asked whether the analysis of the genetic data increases his sense of the risk H5N1 poses to humans, Worobey suggested he was uncomfortable with the knowledge that H5N1 seems to be spreading in mammals, calling that unprecedented. Having the virus in a mammalian species with which people have frequent contact gives H5N1 more opportunities to acquire the mutations needed to be able to evolve to be able to infect people, or \"more shots on goal,\" Worobey said. \"That's bad.\"", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "Having the virus in a mammalian species with which people have frequent contact gives H5N1 more opportunities to acquire the mutations needed to be able to evolve to be able to infect people, or 'more shots on goal,' Worobey said.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Having the virus in a mammalian species with which people have frequent contact gives H5N1 more opportunities to acquire the mutations needed to be able to evolve to be able to infect people, or 'more shots on goal,' Worobey said.

Health officials stress that the risk to the public is low and that the U.S. food supply remains safe and stable. \"At this time, there continues to be no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, or that it affects the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,\" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in a range of mammals in recent years, but this is the first time it has been found in cattle, according to federal health and animal agencies. Genetic analysis of the virus does not show that it has changed to spread more easily in people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Agriculture officials in at least 17 states have restricted imports of dairy cattle from states where the virus has been detected, but so far, government agencies say it has had little effect on commercial milk production. Officials say that cows have probably been infected by exposure to wild birds but that cow-to-cow spread \"cannot be ruled out.\" As of April 12, the strain of bird flu that has killed millions of wild birds in recent years had been found in at least 26 dairy herds in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and South Dakota. Farmers are testing cows that show symptoms of infection, including sharply reduced milk supply and lethargy. Animals that show signs or test positive for illness are being separated from other animals on the farms. The animals appear to recover within two weeks. U.S. egg producers are watching the situation closely after bird flu was detected in chickens in Texas and Michigan. Millions of birds have been killed, but the FDA said the risk of affected eggs getting into the retail market or causing infections in humans is low because of federal inspections and other safeguards. \"We firmly believe that pasteurization provides a safe milk supply,\" Tracey Forfa, director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, said last week. The FDA and the CDC are less certain about unpasteurized, or raw, milk sold in many states, saying there is limited information about the possible transmission of the H5N1 virus in such products. So far, no herds linked to raw milk providers have reported cows infected with bird flu, but the agencies recommend that the industry not make or sell raw milk or raw milk cheese products made with milk from cows that show symptoms or that are exposed to infected cows. U.S. health officials have long warned against the risk of foodborne illness tied to raw milk, which the CDC said caused more than 200 outbreaks that sickened more than 2,600 people between 1998 and 2018. Still, raw milk proponents like Mark McAfee, owner of Raw Farm USA in Fresno, Calif., said the outbreak of H5N1 in commercial cows appears to have spurred higher sales of the products, despite federal warnings. Only dairy cows, not beef cattle, have been infected or shown signs of illness to date, agriculture officials said. Eggs that are handled properly and cooked thoroughly are safe to eat, said Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University. \"A lot of people like runny eggs. Personally, if I eat an egg, it's very well cooked,\" she said. Still, Kowalcyk and others cautioned that the situation could change. - Associated Press", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "Genetic analysis of the virus does not show that it has changed to spread more easily in people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in a range of mammals in recent years, but this is the first time it has been found in cattle, according to federal health and animal agencies.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Officials say that cows have probably been infected by exposure to wild birds but that cow-to-cow spread 'cannot be ruled out.'", "affirm_why_statement_3": "The FDA and the CDC are less certain about unpasteurized, or raw, milk sold in many states, saying there is limited information about the possible transmission of the H5N1 virus in such products.", "affirm_why_statement_4": "Still, Kowalcyk and others cautioned that the situation could change.", "affirm_why_count": 4, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_2": "Health officials stress that the risk to the public is low and that the U.S. food supply remains safe and stable.", "deny_transmissible_statement_3": "\"At this time, there continues to be no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, or that it affects the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,\" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said.", "deny_transmissible_statement_4": "The FDA said the risk of affected eggs getting into the retail market or causing infections in humans is low because of federal inspections and other safeguards.", "deny_transmissible_count": 3, "deny_why_statement_1": "Genetic analysis of the virus does not show that it has changed to spread more easily in people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.", "deny_why_count": 1, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "464", "title": "Why we shouldn't panic if bird flu becomes the next pandemic", "date": "2024-04-23", "fulltext": "It's true that the recent spread of bird flu among dairy cows is an \"enormous concern,\" as Jeremy Farrar, the World Health Organization's chief scientist, described it last week. While only two people in the United States have contracted this H5N1 strain of the avian flu (one last year and one this month), wider spread could be catastrophic, given that, in past outbreaks, the disease has killed one of every two people who are infected. But before anyone panics, let's take a step back and look at the facts. Health officials have a plan in the event avian flu becomes the next pandemic. In fact, as Dawn O'Connell, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, told me, the federal government is much better prepared to respond to pandemic influenza than it was for covid-19. To start, it's much easier today to access personal protective equipment such as masks, gowns and goggles through commercial markets than it was before the coronavirus hit. But even if those supply chains are \"pinched,\" O'Connell said, the Strategic National Stockpile has plenty to provide for farms, health-care systems and other affected entities. The stockpile also contains the antiviral medication Tamiflu, which works against seasonal flu and is expected to work well against H5N1. Like antivirals for covid, Tamiflu reduces the chance of an influenza infection becoming severe when taken soon after symptoms emerge. Unlike covid treatments, however, Tamiflu can also be given to close contacts of infected individuals to prevent them from falling ill. O'Connell explained there are tens of millions of courses of Tamiflu available in the national stockpile. The federal government has also funded states to build their own stockpiles, which means \"tens of millions\" more treatments are available. And this is on top of commercially available Tamiflu, which people can buy at pharmacies with a prescription from their doctors. Another key preventive measure is vaccines. O'Connell, who also oversees vaccine-preparedness efforts, explained that the federal government contracts with three manufacturers that can make avian flu vaccines. Each uses the three platforms approved by the Food and Drug Administration to develop the vaccines: egg-based, cell-based and recombinant. That means if one platform doesn't work, or if one company encounters production problems, there are other options. Moreover, because quite a few influenza strains have already been identified, the federal government keeps a library of antigens, which are used in vaccines to trigger an immune response to flu viruses. Every year, for the seasonal flu shot, scientists try to predict which strains will be dominant that fall. They then analyze existing antigens, test them against the strains, and select the closest-matching antigens to make that year's flu vaccine. Two antigens in the library appear to match H5N1, O'Connell said. The federal government also has adjuvants, the component of vaccines needed to help enhance the body's immune response to the shot, ready for the bird-flu shot as well. In fact, the federal government has already developed hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses that are ready to be deployed against the avian H5N1 strain. In addition, they have 10 million doses that need finishing touches, which could be completed within weeks. If more are needed, there are two options. The first is to make more vaccines using the same technology as seasonal vaccines. O'Connell estimates that manufacturers could produce 125 million doses within 130 days. Because the vaccine is a two-dose vaccine, this would only cover a fraction of the U.S. population. The second option would be to pursue mRNA vaccines, which could be made much faster than the traditional platforms. Even if these vaccines end up not being as effective or as durable as traditional ones, they could be a useful first shot that buys time for additional vaccines to be made. Of course, there is a third option, which is to scale up vaccine production now. O'Connell has a good answer as to why this isn't happening: To make hundreds of millions of doses of avian flu vaccines, manufacturers would have to stop producing seasonal flu shots. This would also takes a lot of extra funding from Congress. \"We'd have to be sure that we were in a position that it warrants that,\" she said. With no evidence of human-to-human transmission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has assessed that the risk to humans is low. Therefore, we have not yet reached the point where ramping up vaccine production is necessary.

{"id": "465", "title": "What consumers should know about the milk testing positive for bird flu", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "Federal officials say the risk to the public remains low after the Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that tests of commercially available milk detected traces of bird flu. The announcement comes amid a national outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) among dairy cows that was first confirmed late last month. The disease, which is very contagious and often fatal in avian populations, has spread to herds in at least eight states. At least one person who was in contact with presumably sick animals also caught the virus. But government officials and scientific experts say so far there is no evidence of infectious virus in pasteurized milk. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Jeanne Marrazzo said Wednesday in a call with reporters that tests conducted on retail milk showed that there was genetic material from the virus. Efforts to grow the virus from those samples indicated that the virus was not infectious or 'alive,' Marrazzo said, adding that testing was only conducted on a small set of samples. 'To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,' the FDA said in a statement. If pasteurization inactivates the virus, why is it showing up in milk? Pasteurization has been used in the U.S. for decades to kill harmful bacteria and viruses in milk, but pasteurization may not erase all traces of a virus. Some genetic material may be left behind after the pasteurization process, such as DNA or RNA, the 'instructions' that tell the virus what to do, according to Cornell University food science professor Samuel Alcaine. 'A car gets in an accident. It's no longer functioning. You can't drive it. It doesn't do anything that a car does. But you sift through the rubble and you could still find the instruction manual that tells it how to work,' he said. Alcaine said that's likely what's happening with bird flu in milk: Tests show the virus used to be there, but it's no longer able to cause an infection. The FDA said there haven't been any studies specifically on whether pasteurization inactivates bird flu in cow's milk because bovine infections are so new. However, it added that previous studies have shown that pasteurization is 'very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses, like H5N1' and that pasteurization has inactivated bird flu in eggs, a process that occurs at a lower temperature than for milk. The FDA said it detected bird flu in milk using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests, which 'do not represent actual virus that may be a risk to consumers.' Further evaluation of milk samples will be done using egg inoculation tests, the FDA said, which it called the 'gold standard for determining viable virus.' The agency said it would release the results from multiple studies within days or weeks. Is it still safe to drink milk? 'There are no safety concerns,' Alcaine said of milk with traces of bird flu. 'I'm still buying my milk from my local grocery store.' Federal officials emphasize that any milk from infected cows is supposed to be discarded or destroyed and not enter the human food supply. On top of that, any milk sold via interstate commerce in the U.S. is required to be pasteurized. The FDA has encouraged consumers not to drink raw, unpasteurized milk. But Alcaine said influenza is generally not transmitted through food, and the more pressing concern is protecting people like farm workers, who could come into close physical contact with infected animals.

{"id": "466", "title": "US requires bird flu tests for dairy cows being moved across states", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "Testing of pasteurised milk from stores found genetic traces of H5N1 virus, but fragments do not indicate it contains live virus. Dairy cows being moved across states must be tested for the bird flu, under a federal order issued on Wednesday aimed at containing the spread of the virus across US cattle farms. The clampdown comes after testing of pasteurised milk from grocery store shelves found genetic traces of the H5N1 virus. Health officials said that these fragments of virus do not indicate that the milk contains live virus and that they have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the supply is safe. Donald Prater, acting director of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said: \"We take the current situation very seriously. Based on information currently available, we believe our commercial milk is safe.\" The new federal order requires every lactating cow to be tested and post a negative result before moving to a new state. Michael Watson, an administrator with the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said that laboratories had the capacity for performing tens of thousands of tests a day. Until now, testing was done voluntarily and only in cows with symptoms, but FDA officials suggested that some producers had not been fully cooperative with allowing testing in their herds. Under the new rules, positive tests will trigger additional requirements for officials to investigate, milk from affected cows would be dumped and cows that test positive would be kept in situ for 30 days before being retested. Officials also gave more detailed information about investigations into the potential for milk to contain infectious virus. Genetic traces of H5N1 were found in commercially bought milk in PCR tests. But these tests detect both live and dead virus fragments. Pasteurisation is designed to kill off the most robust bacteria and viruses, so would be expected to do the same for avian flu, but further tests are needed to confirm this is the case. The FDA said it had been trying to see if it could grow virus from milk found to contain evidence of H5N1, which is the gold standard test to see if there is viable virus in a product. \"Pasteurisation is very likely to inactivate viruses like H5N1,\" said Prater, adding that it is a \"new and evolving\" situation. The outbreak, which has spread to herds across eight states, has prompted concern because it is the first time bird flu has spread between cows, and transmission between mammals raises the risk of the virus adapting in a way that could make it spread more easily in humans. So far, one human case has been reported in a Texas farm worker, who has since recovered, and a further 44 people have been monitored after possible exposure. It is not clear how the virus is spreading between cows, but milk is believed to be the primary vector rather than the virus spreading through respiratory infection. \"We believe that the primary transfer is through milk some kind of mechanical transmission,\" said Watson. This could be via milking equipment, people moving between facilities or rodents, he added. \"At this stage we're just speculating,\" he said. \"It could be spilt milk on floors, if a rat was to come into contact with that milk and then move to a different facility or come into contact with a cow or a piece of equipment.\"", "media_outlet": "Guardian", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The outbreak, which has spread to herds across eight states, has prompted concern because it is the first time bird flu has spread between cows, and transmission between mammals raises the risk of the virus adapting in a way that could make it spread more easily in humans.", "affirm_why_count": 1, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_2": "Based on information currently available, we believe our commercial milk is safe.", "deny_transmissible_statement_4": "Pasteurisation is very likely to inactivate viruses like H5N1.", "deny_transmissible_count": 2, "deny_why_statement_1": "Health officials said that these fragments of virus do not indicate that the milk contains live virus and that they have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the supply is safe.", "deny_why_statement_2": "Pasteurisation is designed to kill off the most robust bacteria and viruses, so would be expected to do the same for avian flu, but further tests are needed to confirm this is the case.", "deny_why_statement_3": "\"Pasteurisation is very likely to inactivate viruses like H5N1,\" said Prater, adding that it is a \"new and evolving\" situation.", "deny_why_count": 3, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

The federal order was announced one day after health officials said they had detected inactivated remnants of the virus, known as Type A H5N1, in samples taken from milk during processing and from store shelves. They stressed that such remnants pose no known risk to people or the milk supply. 'The risk to humans remains low,' said Dawn O'Connell of the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. The new order, which goes into effect Monday, requires every lactating cow to be tested and post a negative result before moving to a new state. It will help the agency understand how the virus is spreading, said Michael Watson, an administrator with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. 'We believe we can do tens of thousands of tests a day,' he told reporters. Until now, testing had been done voluntarily and only in cows with symptoms. Avian influenza was first detected in dairy cows in March and has been found in nearly three dozen herds in eight states, according to USDA. It's an escalation of an ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza spread by wild birds. Since the start of the outbreak, more than 90 million birds in U.S. commercial flocks have either died from the virus or been killed to try to prevent spread. Two people in the U.S. — both farmworkers — have been infected with bird flu since the outbreak began. Health officials said 23 people have been tested for bird flu to date and 44 people exposed to infected animals are being monitored. Officials said that samples from a cow in Kansas showed that the virus could be adapting to more animals and they detected H5N1 virus in the lung tissue of a dairy cow that had been culled and sent to slaughter.

{"id": "468", "title": "What to know about the latest bird flu outbreak in the US", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "A poultry facility in Michigan and egg producer in Texas both reported outbreaks of avian flu this week. The latest developments on the virus also include infected dairy cows and the first known instance of a human catching bird flu from a mammal. Although health officials say the risk to the public remains low, there is rising concern, emerging in part from news that the largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S. reported an outbreak. Here are some key things to know about the disease. WHAT ARE EXPERTS SAYING? Dr. Mandy Cohen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency is taking bird flu seriously, but stressed that the virus has already been well studied. 'The fact that it is in cattle now definitely raises our concern level,' Cohen said, noting that it means farmworkers who work with cattle 'and not just those working with birds may need to take precautions. The good news is that it's not a new strain of the virus,' Cohen added. 'This is known to us and we've been studying it, and frankly, we've been preparing for avian flu for 20 years.' WHAT IS BIRD FLU? Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but others chiefly occur in animals. Avian viruses spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry. The bird flu virus drawing attention today 'Type A H5N1' was first identified in 1959. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself. Since 2020, the virus has been spreading among more animal species including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises in scores of countries. In the U.S., this version of the bird flu has been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks. Nationwide, tens of millions of chickens have died from the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading. Last week, U.S. officials said it had been found in livestock. As of Tuesday, it had been discovered in dairy herds in five states Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE GET BIRD FLU? This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. In the past two decades, nearly 900 people have been diagnosed globally with bird flu and more than 460 people have died, according to the World Health Organization. There have been only two cases in the U.S., and neither were fatal. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. This week, Texas health officials announced that a person who had been in contact with cows had been diagnosed with bird flu. Their only reported symptom was eye redness. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF BIRD FLU? Symptoms are similar to that of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people don't have noticeable symptoms, but others develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia. CAN IT SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE? The vast majority of infected people have gotten it directly from birds, but scientists are on guard for any sign of spread among people. There have been a few instances when that apparently happened most recently in 2007 in Asia. In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home. U.S. health officials have stressed that the current public health risk is low and that there is no sign that bird flu is spreading person to person. WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT? While it's too early to quantify the potential economic impact of a bird flu outbreak, many of these latest developments are concerning, particularly the transmission of the virus from one species to another, said Darin Detwiler, a food safety and policy expert at Northeastern University. 'We don't have a magic forcefield, an invisible shield that protects land and water runoff from impacting other species,' Detwiler said. 'There is a concern in terms of how this might impact other markets, the egg market, the beef market.' If the outbreak is not quickly contained, consumers could ultimately see higher prices, and if it continues to spread, some industries could experience 'reputational strain,' possibly affecting the export industry, Detwiler added. The egg industry already is experiencing some tightening of supply following detections of bird flu late in 2023 and in early January, coupled with the busy Easter season, where Americans typically consume an average of 3 billion eggs, said Marc Dresner, a spokesperson for the American Egg Board. Still, even with the outbreak in Texas and the nearly 2 million birds that were killed there, Dresner said there are an estimated 310 million egg laying hens in the U.S. and wholesale egg prices are down about 25% from a February peak. ___ This story was initially published on April 3.

{"id": "469", "title": "More cows are being tested and tracked for bird flu. Here's what that means", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand and stop the growing outbreak. So far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people. The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Starting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested with negative results before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order. Here's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation: WHY IS THIS OUTBREAK SO UNUSUAL? This strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska. The virus was discovered in ruminants goats and then dairy cows in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years. When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation, said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Flu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said. HOW LONG HAS BIRD FLU BEEN SPREADING IN COWS? Scientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow. Finding remnants of the virus in milk on the market suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized, said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota. Under pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week. The data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona. Since then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said. And then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said. The genetic evidence is as clear as could be, Worobey said. Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations. WHAT DO SCIENTISTS SAY ABOUT EFFORTS TO TRACK THE OUTBREAK? Several experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start. We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on, said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school. Worobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said. That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is, he said. More testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said. Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system, Aliota said. It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences. HOW BIG A RISK DOES BIRD FLU POSE FOR PEOPLE? Scientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon. While the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk. Also, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said. So far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms. WHAT ARE SCIENTISTS' CONCERNS FOR THE FUTURE? David O'Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning. There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we're not there, he said. As with a tornado watch, you wouldn't change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening. Worobey said this is the kind of outbreak that we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has. He said ambitious screening is needed to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.

{"id": "470", "title": "Bird Flu Outbreak in Cattle May Have Begun Months Earlier Than Thought", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "A single spillover, from a bird to a cow, led to the infections, a review of genetic data has found. The bird flu outbreak in American dairy cattle may have begun in January, or even as early as December, a new analysis of genetic data suggests. The Department of Agriculture announced in late March that dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas had tested positive for the virus, called H5N1. It has since reported cases in dozens of herds in eight states. On Tuesday, federal health officials said they had discovered fragments of H5N1 in milk samples obtained at various sites across the nation. The fragments pose no threat to consumers, the officials said. It is unclear exactly how the cows became infected, but the most likely source is feces or other secretions from a wild bird infected with the virus. Scientists in the United States and elsewhere have criticized federal agencies for withholding key information about the outbreaks, including genetic sequences of the virus from infected cows, The New York Times reported on Friday. The data may hold valuable clues to the evolution of the virus and the extent of the outbreak. On Sunday, the department published 239 genetic sequences, but it omitted some details regarding the locations from which they were obtained and the dates. Still, the information is enough to glean that a single spillover event months ago, from bird to cow, set off the outbreak, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. Dr. Worobey said he worked late into Monday night and early Tuesday morning analyzing the genetic information. He found that the sequences all carried the same set of mutations that allow the virus to infect mammals, which would be unlikely had the virus jumped from birds to cows more than once. He said that this really does just look like a single introduction. H5N1 is highly lethal in birds, but so far has led to mostly mild symptoms in cattle and in one farmworker in Texas who became infected. Infected dairy cows seem to carry large amounts of virus in their milk, which turns thick and yellowish. But the Department of Agriculture has released little information on other aspects of the outbreak, including how long cows remain ill and how long it takes them to clear the virus from their bodies, said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, director of the Boston University Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases. We just don't know enough about the natural history of bird flu in cows, she said. Federal scientists are just beginning to analyze more samples from cows without symptoms to learn whether the outbreak may be more widespread than initially thought. If this really is something that's been going on for this long, it seems quite plausible that it's moved already out of the U.S., Dr. Worobey said. Canada imports cattle from the United States, he noted. Some farmers in Texas had been reporting sick cows since at least February. Cows are not usually infected with this type of influenza, and federal officials spent weeks trying to identify the cause of the outbreak. But rather than research each potential pathogen, officials could have turned to a technique called metagenomic sequencing, in which samples can be tested for nearly all known pathogens at once. That technique is more expensive but would save valuable time in situations like this, Dr. Worobey said. I think that's one of the real lost opportunities here, he said. Just the fact that we don't have eyes on these things around the world, and even in the U.S., we keep getting caught with our bathing suit off when the tide goes out.

{"id": "471", "title": "Dairy Cows Transported Between States Must Now Be Tested for Bird Flu", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "Since a new form of bird flu arrived in 2022, federal officials have sought to reassure Americans that the threat to the public remained low. The Biden administration on Wednesday said that it would begin requiring dairy cows moving across state lines to be tested for bird flu, which has been spreading in herds for months. The new policy is part of a growing effort to stamp out the spread of a virus that federal health officials have sought to reassure Americans poses little risk to people so far. The new order, issued by the Department of Agriculture, says that lactating cows must test negative for influenza A viruses, a class that includes bird flu, before they are transported. The owners of herds with positive tests will need to provide data on the movements of the cattle to help investigators trace the disease. The testing will help protect the livestock industry, limit the spread of the virus and better understand this disease, Mike Watson, a senior Department of Agriculture official, told reporters in a press briefing Wednesday morning. Since a highly contagious form of bird flu was detected in the United States in 2022, federal officials have sought to reassure Americans that the threat to the public remained low, even as the virus infected a growing number of mammals. Federal regulators on Tuesday announced that inactive viral fragments had been found in pasteurized milk, a suggestion that the virus was likely spreading much more widely among cattle than previously known. Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on Wednesday that there were no changes in the genetic makeup of the virus that would allow it to spread easily among people. So far, Dr. Shah said, states have been monitoring 44 people who were exposed to the virus and are being monitored for infection. As of Wednesday, the outbreak had spread to 33 herds in eight states, according to the U.S.D.A. But just one human infection has been reported, in a dairy worker in Texas who had direct contact with sick cows. The case was mild. Federal officials on Wednesday also sought to downplay the severity of the findings of the Food and Drug Administration in recent days that inactive viral fragments had been found in pasteurized milk, including some from grocery shelves. Don Prater, an F.D.A. official, told reporters on Wednesday that regulators were conducting more advanced tests to determine whether any milk contained live virus. The agency would publish data in the coming days on the milk tests, he said. The U.S.D.A. order will require laboratories and state veterinarians to report any positive tests from cattle to the agency. Mr. Watson said that the department would be able to process tens of thousands of tests each day, with results reported after one to three days. The agency will now reimburse dairies for testing cows without symptoms as well as those being moved. Dr. Shah, the C.D.C. official, said that the federal government was relying on local officials and health workers to communicate with dairy producers and their workers, including veterinarians who have close relationships with people who might be hesitant to open up to strangers. There may be owners that are reluctant to work with public health, to say nothing of individual workers who may be reluctant to sit down with somebody who identifies themselves as being from the government in some way, Dr. Shah said. It is still not clear when the bird flu outbreak began, but an analysis of genetic data suggests that wild birds might have passed the pathogen to cows as early as December. Cows were not typically thought to be susceptible to bird flu, and it was not until late March that federal officials announced that the virus had been detected in sick cows in Texas and Kansas. The U.S.D.A. order came after public health experts and dairy producers had criticized the Biden administration for the scope of its investigation into the cow outbreak and the lack of widespread testing. While testing more cows is critical, so is reducing the risk of infection among dairy workers regularly exposed to fresh milk now thought to contain extensive virus, said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University. If a worker were to get splashed in the nose or eyes and become infected, that human infection would give the virus new opportunities to adapt and start spreading among people, she said. Federal health officials said on Wednesday that they had reminded states that they could request protective equipment from the national stockpile. But Dr. Lakdawala said the risks of worker infections were already serious enough that farms should universally implement the use of face shields. She said other steps, like a two-week stay-at-home order for cows, could also obviate the need for even more economically disruptive measures. Troy Sutton, a virologist at Penn State University, said the emergence of the bird flu in cattle had intensified efforts to understand the virus.

{"id": "472", "title": "This May Be Our Last Chance to Halt Bird Flu in Humans, and We Are Blowing It", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "The outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza among U.S. dairy cows, first reported on March 25, has now spread to at least 33 herds in eight states. On Wednesday, genetic evidence of the virus turned up in commercially available milk. Federal authorities say the milk supply is safe, but this latest development raises troubling questions about how widespread the outbreak really is. So far, there is only one confirmed human case. Rick Bright, an expert on the H5N1 virus who served on President Biden's coronavirus advisory board, told me this is the crucial moment. 'There's a fine line between one person and 10 people with H5N1,' he said. 'By the time we've detected 10, it's probably too late to contain. That's when I told him what I'd heard from Sid Miller, the Texas commissioner for agriculture. He said he strongly suspected that the outbreak dated back to at least February. The commissioner speculated that then as many as 40 percent of the herds in the Texas Panhandle might have been infected. Dr. Bright fell silent, then asked a very reasonable question: 'Doesn't anyone keep tabs on this?' The H5N1 outbreak, already a devastating crisis for cattle farmers and their herds, has the potential to turn into an enormous tragedy for the rest of us. But having spent the past two weeks trying to get answers from our nation's public health authorities, I'm shocked by how little they seem to know about what's going on and how little of what they do know is being shared in a timely manner. How exactly is the infection transmitted between herds? The United States Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all say they are working to figure it out. According to many public health officials, the virus load in the infected cows' milk is especially high, raising the possibility that the disease is being spread through milking machines or from aerosolized spray when the milking room floors are power washed. Another possible route is the cows' feed, owing to the fairly revolting fact that the U.S. allows farmers to feed leftover poultry bedding material — feathers, excrement, spilled seeds — to dairy and beef cattle as a cheap source of additional protein. Alarmingly, the U.S.D.A. told me that it has evidence that the virus has also spread from dairy farms back to poultry farms 'through an unknown route.' Well, one thing that travels back and forth between cattle farms and chicken farms is human beings. They can also travel from cattle farms to pig farms, and pigs are the doomsday animals for human influenza pandemics. Because they are especially susceptible to both avian and human flu, they make for good petri dishes in which avian influenza can become an effective human virus. The damage could be vast. The U.S.D.A. also told me it doesn't know how many farmers have tested their cattle and doesn't know how many of those tests came up positive; whatever testing is being done takes place at the state level or in private labs. Just Wednesday, the agency made it mandatory to report all positive results, a long overdue step that is still 'without the negative results alongside them' insufficient to give us a full picture. Also on Wednesday, the U.S.D.A. made testing mandatory for dairy cattle that are being moved from one state to another. It says mandatory testing of other herds wouldn't be 'practical, feasible or necessarily informative' because of 'several reasons, ranging from laboratory capacity to testing turnaround times.' The furthest the agency will go is to recommend voluntary testing for cattle that show symptoms of the illness — which not all that are infected do. Dr. Bright compares this to the Trump administration's approach to Covid-19: If you don't test, it doesn't exist. As for the F.D.A., it tells me it hasn't completed specific tests to confirm that pasteurization would make milk from infected cows safe, though the agency considers it 'very likely' based on extensive testing for other pathogens. (It is not yet clear whether the elements of the H5N1 virus that recently turned up in milk had been fully neutralized.) That testing should have been completed by now. In any case, unpasteurized milk remains legal in many states. Dr. Bright told me that 'this is a major concern, especially given recent infections and deaths in cats that have consumed infected milk.' Making matters worse, the U.S.D.A. failed to share the genomes from infected animals in a timely manner, and then when it shared the genomes did so in an unwieldy format and without any geographic information, causing scientists to tear their hair out in frustration. All this makes catching potential human cases so urgent. Dr. Bright says that given a situation like this, and the fact that undocumented farmworkers may not have access to health care, the government should be using every sophisticated surveillance technique, including wastewater testing, and reporting the results publicly. That is not happening. The C.D.C. says it is monitoring data from emergency rooms for any signs of an outbreak. By the time enough people are sick enough to be noticed in emergency rooms, it is almost certainly too late to prevent one. So far, the agency told me, it is aware of only 23 people who have been tested. That tiny number is deeply troubling. (Others may be getting tested through private providers, but if negative, the results do not have to be reported.) On the ground, people are doing the best they can. Adeline Hambley, a public health officer in Ottawa, Mich., told me of a farm whose herd had tested positive. The farm owner voluntarily handed over the workers' cellphone numbers, and the workers got texts asking them to report all potential symptoms. Lynn Sutfin, a public information officer in the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, told me that response rates to those texts and other forms of outreach can be as high as 90 percent. That's heartening, but it's too much to expect that a poor farmworker afraid of stigma, legal troubles and economic loss will always report even mild symptoms and stay home from work as instructed. It's entirely possible that we'll get lucky with H5N1 and it will never manage to spread among humans. Spillovers from animals to humans are common, yet pandemics are rare because they require a chain of unlucky events to happen one after the other. But pandemics are a numbers game, and a widespread animal outbreak like this raises the risks. When dangerous novel pathogens emerge among humans, there is only a small window of time in which to stop them before they spiral out of control. Neither our animal farming practices nor our public health tools seem up to the task. There is some good news: David Boucher, at the federal government's Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, told me that this virus strain is a close match for some vaccines that have already been formulated and that America has the capacity to manufacture and potentially distribute many millions of doses, and fairly quickly, if it takes off in humans. That ability is a little like fire insurance — glad it exists, but by the time it comes into play your house has already burned down. I'm sure the employees of these agencies are working hard, but the message they are sending is, 'Trust us — we are on this.' One troubling legacy of the coronavirus pandemic is that there was too much attention on telling the public how to feel — to panic or not panic — rather than sharing facts and inspiring confidence through transparency and competence. And four years later we have an added layer of polarization and distrust to work around. In April 2020, the Trump administration ousted Dr. Bright from his position as the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the agency responsible for fighting emerging pandemics. In a whistle-blower complaint, he alleged this happened after his early warnings against the coronavirus pandemic were ignored and as retaliation for his caution against unproven treatments favored by Donald Trump.

{"id": "473", "title": "How Bird Flu Is Shaping People�s Lives", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. For the past couple of years, scientists have watched with growing concern as a massive outbreak of avian flu, also known as H5N1 bird flu, has swept through bird populations. Recently in the U.S., a farm worker and some cattle herds have been infected. I spoke with my colleague Katherine J. Wu, who covered the virus' spread in North America, about the risk of human infection and how, for animals, this has already been a pandemic many times over. First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic: * Welcome to the TikTok meltdown. * The Republicans who want American carnage * Columbia has resorted to pedagogy theater. Not a Five-Alarm Fire Lora Kelley: How does this bird-flu outbreak compare with previous ones? Katherine J. Wu: When we're considering the toll on nonhuman animals, this is the largest, most deadly H5N1 outbreak that has been recorded in North America. It has been unfolding slowly for about two and a half years now, but it's become a gargantuan wave at this point. Lora: Wow—how alarmed are you by that? Katherine: I'm medium concerned—and I have been medium concerned for a couple of years now. It's difficult to gauge the amount of alarm to feel, because it's so unprecedented. Still, most H5N1 outbreaks in the past have totally fizzled without much consequence, especially in this part of the world. I am worried because so many species have been getting sick. A huge number of wild birds have been infected, including species that haven't been affected in the past. And we've seen these massive outbreaks in domesticated chickens, which are packed together in farms. Avian flu is known to be a bird problem. Beyond that, we've been seeing these outbreaks in mammals for a couple of years now, which is more concerning because, of course, we are also mammals. Humans seem to be potentially susceptible to infection, but at the same time, it would take quite a lot for this to become another big human-flu pandemic. Lora: Should we be concerned about getting sick? Katherine: People should be vigilant and paying attention to the news. But right now, as you and I are talking, there is still not a huge risk to people. You don't get a pandemic unless you have a pathogen that spreads very, very easily among people, and there's no evidence so far that this virus has mutated to that point. There have been some human cases globally so far, but it's a very small number. They seem to have been cases where someone was highly exposed to the virus in domesticated animals. People got sick, but they didn't pass it to someone else. I'm definitely not saying that person-to-person transmission can't happen eventually, but there's a pretty big chasm between someone getting infected and someone being able to efficiently pass the virus on. It is concerning that we continue to see more mammal species affected by H5N1, including species that have a lot of close contact with humans. But this is not a five-alarm fire so far. Lora: How will people's lives be affected? Katherine: The virus has already affected our lives. Egg prices went completely bonkers in 2022 and early 2023, and over the course of this outbreak, more than 90 million domestic poultry have died. It's not that all of those birds got sick—when this virus breaks out on chicken farms, it's generally considered good practice to cull the chickens to halt the spread. Still, when you have that many chickens dying, egg prices are going to go up. We're probably not on track to see that with cows anytime soon. Even though this virus has now been detected in dairy cows, they aren't getting wildly sick, and transmission doesn't seem as efficient. I don't think we're going to be in a situation where we're killing all of our dairy cows and no one can get milk. Lora: The FDA announced yesterday that genetic evidence of this bird-flu virus had been found in samples of pasteurized milk. Is it still safe to drink milk? Katherine: So far, the answer is: generally, yes, if it's been pasteurized. Pasteurization is a process by which milk is treated with heat so that it will kill a whole bunch of pathogens, including bacteria and viruses, and H5N1 is thought to be vulnerable to this. Also, researchers have been working to test cows so they can figure out which ones are sick. Only milk from healthy cows is authorized to enter the general food supply, though the trick will be finding all the cows that are actually infected. For now, the main ways that this virus will affect us will be indirect. Lora: Is there anything that can be done to curb the spread among wild animals? Katherine: For the animal world, this has already been a pandemic many times over. It has been truly devastating in that respect. So many wild birds, sea lions, seals, and other creatures have died, and it's difficult to see how people can effectively intervene out in nature. There have been very few cases in which endangered animals have received vaccines because there's a real possibility that their populations could be 100 percent wiped out by this virus. For most other animals in the wild, there's not a lot that can be done, except for people to pay attention to where the virus is spreading. The hope is that most animal populations will be resilient enough to get through this and develop some form of immunity. Lora: Responses to COVID became very politicized. How might the aftermath of those mitigation measures shape how people respond to this virus, especially if it becomes a greater threat to humans? Katherine: We're so fresh off the worst days of COVID that if people were asked to buckle down or get a new vaccine, I suspect that a lot of them would be like, Not again. There is still a lot of mitigation fatigue, and many people are sick of thinking about respiratory viruses and taking measures to prevent outbreaks. And, certainly, people have lost a lot of trust in public health over the past four years. That said, H5N1 is still a flu, and people are familiar with that type of virus. We have a long history of using flu vaccines, and the government has experience making a pandemic vaccine, keeping that stockpile, and getting it out to the public. That gives me hope that at least some people will be amenable to taking the necessary preventative measures, so any potential bird-flu outbreak among humans would not turn into COVID 2.0.

Prices have increased 2.5 percent over the past year, down from increases as high as 7 percent during the early pandemic. Rents are high but stabilizing. The cost of groceries is ticking up, not surging, and some goods, such as eggs, are actually getting cheaper. But American consumers are still stretching to afford one big-ticket item: their cars.

{"id": "474", "title": "US government will require more testing, tracking of bird flu in dairy cows", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "(CNN) - The US Department of Agriculture said Wednesday that it is issuing a federal order to require more testing and reporting of H5N1 influenza, more commonly known as bird flu, in dairy cows. The USDA had previously required reporting of H5N1 influenza in poultry and wild birds, but producers were not required to let the government know if cows tested positive - a factor the USDA admitted had hampered its ability to investigate the spread of the current outbreak in cattle. Since cases were confirmed in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas in late March, 33 farms in eight states have identified cases. The new order is part of a slate of measures the government is taking to address H5N1 flu, which has been devastating to bird populations and recently begun to infect an increasing number of mammals, potentially bringing it a step closer to being able to spread efficiently between people. The USDA said at a multiagency news conference Wednesday that the new order would help it get more information on the growing outbreak. \"There has been a little bit of reluctance for some of the producers to allow us to gather information from their farms,\" said Dr. Michael Watson, administrator of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or APHIS. \"With the federal order going into place, this is going to really help us address any gaps that might exist.\" The order will require that dairy cattle moving between states be tested for avian flu or any type of influenza A before they can travel.

{"id": "475", "title": "Massive amounts of H5N1 vaccine would be needed if there� a bird flu pandemic. Can we make enough?", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "The unsettling reality of H5N1 bird flu circulating in dairy cow herds in multiple parts of the United States is raising anxiety levels about whether this dangerous virus, which has haunted the sleep of people who worry about influenza pandemics for more than 20 years, could be on a path to acquiring the ability to easily infect people. To be clear, there is no evidence that this is currently the case—the sole confirmed human case reported in Texas three weeks ago was in a farm worker who had contact with cattle. There is no way to predict if the virus will acquire the capacity to spread between people, or when and under what conditions it would make that fateful leap if it does. But the first signs that H5N1 or any new flu virus was starting to spread from person to person would trigger a race to produce massive amounts of vaccine to try to mitigate the damage a flu pandemic might be expected to cause. While the 2009 H1N1 pandemic is estimated to have killed about a quarter-million people worldwide—severe flu seasons sometimes kill more—the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic is believed to have killed between 50 million and 100 million people, many times more than Covid-19. The good news: The world makes a lot of flu vaccine and has been doing it for decades. Regulatory agencies have well-oiled systems to allow manufacturers to update the viruses the vaccines target without having to seek new licenses. The United States even has some H5 vaccine in a stockpile that it believes would offer protection against the version of the H5N1 virus infecting dairy cattle, though there would not be nearly enough doses for the entire country. Related: USDA releases H5N1 bird flu genetic data eagerly awaited by scientists. The bad news: The current global production capacity isn’t close to adequate to vaccinate a large portion of the world’s population in the first year of a pandemic. And batches of flu vaccine, often (though not always) produced in hen’s eggs, take months to produce. The Covid pandemic saw vaccine manufacturers around the world pump out unprecedented amounts of vaccine in an extraordinarily short period of time. By February 2022, 14 months after vaccination efforts began, it was estimated that 11 billion doses of vaccine had been produced and delivered. Could that record be matched—broken?—if H5N1 starts a pandemic? Would the profound inequity of the Covid vaccine distribution, which had affluent countries awash with doses while low-income countries waited for supplies, be remedied or repeated? Experts STAT interviewed suggested that in some respects, the world is better positioned to produce pandemic flu vaccines, if the need arises. But a number warned that assuming the successes of Covid vaccine production would automatically influence the speed and scale of pandemic flu vaccine production would be unwise. “You just have a different [production] system for flu vaccines than we developed on the fly for Covid,” said Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, better known as CEPI, an international organization tasked with spurring development of medical countermeasures for diseases that can cause epidemics and pandemics. “And the … system that we developed for Covid can’t just be repurposed for flu.” Let’s explore some of the ways the world is perhaps better prepared than it was in the past, and some of the snarls that could slow efforts to protect against a dangerous pandemic. What the need would be: To gain protection against seasonal flu, most people get vaccinated with one dose of vaccine. Young children who’ve never been vaccinated against flu are an exception; kids ages 6 months to 8 years must get two doses of vaccine, at least four weeks apart, the first time they are vaccinated. Why? Because they are considered to be “naive” to influenza, and their immune systems need to be primed (introduced to flu viruses) and then boosted. Anyone over age 8 is likely to have encountered flu before; they’ve already been primed. One dose is sufficient to acquaint immune systems to the evolved versions of previously encountered seasonal flu viruses. But with a brand-new flu virus—and H5N1 definitely falls into that category for humans—everyone will be naive. So the assumption of pandemic planners is that everyone would need two doses of vaccine in the first season of vaccinating against H5N1. (During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the new virus was distantly related to one that had circulated for much of the previous century, and one dose was adequate for protection. There’s no expectation that would be true with an H5 pandemic.) That math is daunting: The 8.1 billion people worldwide times two is 16.2 billion doses. Babies under the age of 6 months aren’t vaccinated against flu—their immune systems aren’t yet sufficiently developed for it to be effective—so that number would be a bit lower. But there’s always waste in vaccine delivery, so the 16 billion probably isn’t far off.

Speaking of kids, there’s a dynamic at play with H5N1 that wasn’t seen in the Covid pandemic, one that adds to the complexity of vaccinating the planet in a flu pandemic. The vast majority of Covid deaths were in older adults; there were relatively few deaths in children. But flu infections are hardest on older adults and little kids. In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it is estimated that nearly 1,300 children under the age of 17 died, a high toll when compared to a typical flu season. And 2009 was mild, in pandemic terms. Furthermore, kids amplify the transmission of flu in communities, Hatchett said, noting the fall wave of the 2009 pandemic in the U.S. started in late summer, when southern states went back to school. A really bad pandemic could change public opinion rapidly, but at present it seems unlikely there would be much appetite for closing schools to slow spread of a new flu virus. School closures are one of the most reviled of the containment measures that were used in the Covid pandemic. “The disease is different. It behaves differently. It has different mortality patterns and different transmission patterns. And we would be in a setup because we’d be coming out of Covid with a Covid mindset and Covid biases that would jeopardize our ability to do the right thing if there were a flu pandemic,” Hatchett said. So while the United States waited into 2022 before starting to vaccinate children against Covid—and some countries didn’t vaccinate children at all—kids will be in the pool of people who need to be vaccinated when the next flu pandemic hits. What the current production capacity is: An assessment of market capacity published by the World Health Organization in January estimated that the combined global supply was 1.2 billion trivalent doses of flu vaccine, which target three flu virus strains at a time. During a pandemic, the vaccine made would target a single virus, the new one. So, in theory, 1.2 billion vaccine doses could become 3.6 billion vaccine doses. More than 85% of those doses are made by seven producers, the WHO analysis said, and over 95% of seasonal vaccine doses are used in high- and upper-middle income countries, which will almost certainly have first dibs on pandemic vaccines. More on this later. Back to the math. How much vaccine would each person need? The 3.6 billion doses would be enough for 1.8 billion people. But that’s only if the same amount of vaccine used to protect against seasonal flu viruses would protect against H5N1. And there we run into another problem. Research done in the mid-2000s found that H5N1 is poorly immunogenic in people; it doesn’t trigger a strong immune response unless it’s administered in large amounts, or is given with a boosting compound known as an adjuvant that broadly stimulates the immune system. In a seasonal flu shot, each component contains 15 micrograms of antigen or vaccine. In that study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, it took two doses of 90 micrograms—12 times the amount used to protect against a strain in the seasonal vaccine—to induce what’s thought to be a protective response in just over half of the volunteers. In a world where need will outstrip supply, that’s a wholly unworkable dosage. In the years since, multiple studies have been conducted to see whether adjuvants could lower the amount of antigen needed and stretch supplies. They do. Some studies have even suggested fractional doses, with an adjuvant, could be effective. For example, CSL Seqirus, which supplies flu vaccine to the U.S. market and has a licensed pandemic H5N1 vaccine in the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS), showed that 7.5 micrograms, with an adjuvant, would generate what’s thought to be a protective response in a portion of adults. The studies were small, so the range of the estimates is broad, but between 28% and 64% of volunteers ages 18 through 64 and 17% to 57% of volunteers ages 65 and older developed what is thought to be a protective level of antibodies from the 7.5 microgram shot. Related: Why a leading bird flu expert isn’t convinced that the risk H5N1 poses to people has declined. But not all flu vaccine manufacturers use or have proprietary adjuvants. CSL Seqirus and GSK do; Sanofi, a major producer of flu vaccines, currently does not. And the global supply of adjuvants could be a bottleneck in any effort to vaccinate the world against H5N1, experts say. “I would be very curious to know what the global production capacity for the relevant adjuvants that we have data for would be. And I suspect it would be vastly insufficient to what is needed,” Hatchett said. The U.S. has stores of adjuvants in the NPIVS, said David Boucher, director of infectious diseases preparedness and response for the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. How quickly could the U.S. respond? The United States has been doing active pandemic preparedness work for at least the past two decades. It understood that domestic production of flu vaccine would be critical in a pandemic, when borders might close to exports if a situation became dire. (Witness India’s refusal to export Covid vaccines in spring 2021 when it was hit with a huge wave of cases.) The government incentivized development of flu vaccine manufacturing and fill-and-finish operations in the U.S. The country, through ASPR, has worked with flu vaccine manufacturers to develop and test batches of H5N1 vaccines targeting different versions of the virus. H5N1 vaccine has already been tested in children, which will help speed availability for a group that is typically at the end of the testing list. (Manufacturers are reluctant to test vaccines in children until they have lots of adult safety data.) There are currently four types of H5N1 vaccine in the NPIVS, said Boucher. Analysis of the viruses they are based on and the viruses from the cattle outbreaks suggests that two of the stockpiled vaccines are sufficiently close, genetically, to be useful, should this version of the virus take off, the WHO and the CDC have stated. “We have right now two candidate vaccine viruses that are very well matched to the current virus from those we have,” Boucher said. About 10 million doses are being stored in bulk, and “hundreds of thousands” of doses have already been placed in vials. That’s a start. But with two doses needed per person, it would not go very far. Boucher said decisions on who the first doses would go to have yet to be made. Those vaccines haven’t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the agency has a fast-track process for updating flu vaccines, and a lot of recent experience with emergency authorization of pandemic vaccines. It can make this happen fast. “Some fraction” of the doses in the filled vials could be available within weeks, Boucher said, depending on how quickly the regulatory process went. And while the bulk antigen was being put into vials, large-scale manufacturing would kick into gear. He estimated that tens of millions of doses could be manufactured over a four- or five-month period. An ASPR spokesperson later put the figure at about 125 million doses. (Remember, 125 million doses would be enough to vaccinate 62.5 million people, about a fifth of the U.S. population.) Kathleen Neuzil, a longtime influenza vaccine researcher at the University of Maryland who takes over as director of the Fogarty International Center at the National Institutes of Health in early May, studied one of the two stockpiled vaccines that Boucher mentioned. It is based on an H5N8 virus and has the same key component as H5N1. (The major target of a flu vaccine is the hemagglutinin protein on the viruses’ surface, the H in a strain’s name.) Her group tested blood from people vaccinated with it against a virus related to the ones that have been seen in cows, which come from a subgroup of H5N1 known as 2.3.4.4b. Although the vaccine targets a 2.3.4.4c virus—a slightly different clade—the researchers saw good antibody responses in people who had received two 15-microgram doses of the vaccine, with adjuvant. “We had tested this H5N8 vaccine that’s in the stockpile to that strain, and it had pretty good cross reactivity if you use an adjuvant,” Neuzil told STAT. Would the stockpiled vaccine protect us, if H5 triggers a pandemic? Two vaccine and pandemic preparedness experts who used to work for the FDA recently questioned how useful the stockpiled vaccine would be, in an opinion piece in STAT. “Let’s say that by a miracle that it really is a good match, that it’s protective and all that. It’s available in such limited numbers it’s just not meaningful for the response,” Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at FDA and former member of the National Security Council, said in an interview. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said it would be prudent to remember the vaccine experience of the 2009 pandemic when making projections about how effective the stockpiled vaccine might be against a virus that evolves to be able to spread from person to person. A study of how well the vaccine worked then showed good protection for young people but no discernible protection for older adults. “You had the strain in the vaccine. And you still saw a relative lack of protection that you would expect to have with a closely matched virus,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how long it takes to produce additional doses, if they are needed. Making a new type of flu vaccine requires manufacturers to learn how to grow large volumes of the viruses. Some viruses grow better than others; sometimes it takes time to learn how to optimize growth. In 2009, manufacturers initially struggled to produce adequate supply of viruses, delaying rollout of the vaccines. In fact, though tens of millions of Americans were vaccinated against H1N1 in 2009, the fall wave of that pandemic—when the vast majority of U.S. cases occurred—had already largely subsided by the time vaccine doses were available in substantial numbers. (Source: The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, the University of Minnesota) Could mRNA vaccines be a wild card? During the Covid pandemic, messenger RNA vaccines—which are quicker to make because they don’t require growing supplies of virus—hit the market with incredible speed. But it’s not clear what role mRNA vaccines would play in a flu pandemic, if one were to occur soon. Both Pfizer and Moderna, the major mRNA players, are developing flu vaccines they hope to combine with Covid shots in a bid to boost flagging sales of the latter and grab a share of the pretty saturated seasonal flu vaccine market. Both have reported that for influenza A—H5N1 belongs to that large flu family—their vaccines appeared to induce immune responses similar to those seen generated by traditional flu vaccines. Moderna is currently testing an H5N1 vaccine, from the 2.3.4.4b subset of viruses, in people. That trial began last summer. But the trial’s listing in the Clinicaltrials.gov database is cagey about the dosages Moderna is testing, calling them simply dose number 1, 2 and 3. Christopher Ridley, Moderna’s vice president of communications, said the detail was obscured for “competitive reasons.” Given how likely it is for mRNA vaccines to induce unpleasant side effects, especially at higher doses, and given how poorly immunogenic H5N1 viruses are, finding a sweet spot—an mRNA H5 vaccine that would be both effective and tolerable to take—could take some work. Hatchett thinks that regulators will want more data before they embrace mRNA vaccines as a solution in a flu pandemic—though he and others have noted that in a true crisis, “all bets are off.” “My intuition would be that we are still in a vulnerable period when it’s not just an instant solution,” he said of the mRNA option. “I think if we make the proper investments, we could very soon get to the point where we know what the dose needs to be and have mRNA vaccines against avian strains as part of our arsenal and scale it quickly. I just don’t think we’ve worked that through yet.” Trending Now: H5N1 bird flu virus particles found in pasteurized milk but FDA says commercial milk supply appears safe. Boucher said ASPR is looking to add mRNA H5N1 vaccine to the stockpile, having recently issued a request for proposals from manufacturers. It is still assessing the submissions it generated, he said. Seth Berkley, who stepped down last summer after 12 years as CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, raised other questions about mRNA as an option for a pandemic flu response, noting that with the Covid mRNA vaccines, the protection against any infection waned quickly and the vaccines needed to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures, which made them impractical for parts of the world. “But if you were to say, we want to make flu vaccines for the world, would that be mRNA technology? Or … wouldn’t you want a vaccine, probably adjuvanted, that would take a little longer to make, but might be inexpensive and easy to produce and give longer immunity?” Berkeley mused. “We don’t know, but those are the questions that will have to get asked, and they didn’t get asked in Covid because of the emergency we were in.” Will lower-income countries have to wait yet again? In 2009, the Obama administration announced it would donate 10% of the U.S. stocks of vaccine, as they rolled off the manufacturing line, starting after high-risk people in the country were vaccinated. Hatchett was one of the people tasked with running that program. Other countries were persuaded to join, and the WHO led an effort to redistribute vaccine to countries that could not buy their way into the vaccine purchasing lines. Eventually, Hatchett said, about 200 million doses were donated, but by the time they were available, the pandemic had subsided. When the program was wound down in October of 2010, about 80 million doses had been distributed. Fast forward to the Covid pandemic. Nearly 2 billion doses of Covid vaccine were distributed through COVAX, an entity set up by the WHO, Gavi, CEPI, and UNICEF (the United Nation’s Children’s Fund) to try to secure vaccine for countries boxed out of the market. And still, vaccine distribution was hugely inequitable. That fact was part of the inspiration for the ongoing efforts to come up with an international pandemic accord that would try to ensure vaccines, drugs, and other medical essentials are more fairly distributed in the next pandemic. Those efforts have struggled to reach a consensus acceptable to all parties. People who know the flu vaccine market think the dynamics may not be vastly different in the next pandemic than they were in the last two. “I would say even today, it’s true that the countries with the manufacturing capacity will be the countries with the early access to these vaccines,” Neuzil cautioned. An in-depth analysis of global seasonal and pandemic flu vaccine production capacity, led by the WHO and based on 2019 data, showed that low- and middle-income countries made up 38% of the world’s population, but produced 2% of seasonal influenza vaccine. There was no flu vaccine production in Africa, and a Moderna plan to build an mRNA vaccine production facility there was recently shelved, a move the company ascribed to the sharp drop in sales of its Covid vaccine. Hatchett said a problem that existed in 2009 was the fact that high-income countries that bought seasonal flu vaccine had provisions in their contracts that gave them first or early access to pandemic vaccine, if the need arose.

{"id": "476", "title": "Watch: What we know about traces of H5N1 bird flu found in pasteurized milk", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "Genetic evidence of the H5N1 bird flu virus was found in grocery store milk in the United States this week, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The news follows the discovery that the avian flu has been detected in dairy cows. But what do traces of virus in pasteurized milk mean for consumers? In this video, STAT explains what is known about the safety of milk on grocery shelves. But the first signs that H5N1 or any new flu virus was starting to spread from person to person would trigger a race to produce massive amounts of vaccine to try to mitigate the damage a flu pandemic might be expected to cause. While the 2009 H1N1 pandemic is estimated to have killed about a quarter-million people worldwide, severe flu seasons sometimes kill more; the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic is believed to have killed between 50 million and 100 million people, many times more than Covid-19. The good news: The world makes a lot of flu vaccine and has been doing it for decades. Regulatory agencies have well-oiled systems to allow manufacturers to update the viruses the vaccines target without having to seek new licenses. The United States even has some H5 vaccine in a stockpile that it believes would offer protection against the version of the H5N1 virus infecting dairy cattle, though there would not be nearly enough doses for the entire country. Related: USDA releases H5N1 bird flu genetic data eagerly awaited by scientists. The bad news: The current global production capacity isn’t close to adequate to vaccinate a large portion of the world’s population in the first year of a pandemic. And batches of flu vaccine, often (though not always) produced in hen’s eggs, take months to produce. The Covid pandemic saw vaccine manufacturers around the world pump out unprecedented amounts of vaccine in an extraordinarily short period of time. By February 2022, 14 months after vaccination efforts began, it was estimated that 11 billion doses of vaccine had been produced and delivered. Could that record be matched or broken if H5N1 starts a pandemic? Would the profound inequity of the Covid vaccine distribution, which had affluent countries awash with doses while low-income countries waited for supplies, be remedied or repeated? Experts STAT interviewed suggested that in some respects, the world is better positioned to produce pandemic flu vaccines, if the need arises. But a number warned that assuming the successes of Covid vaccine production would automatically influence the speed and scale of pandemic flu vaccine production would be unwise. “You just have a different [production] system for flu vaccines than we developed on the fly for Covid,” said Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, better known as CEPI, an international organization tasked with spurring development of medical countermeasures for diseases that can cause epidemics and pandemics. “And the … system that we developed for Covid can’t just be repurposed for flu.” Let’s explore some of the ways the world is perhaps better prepared than it was in the past, and some of the snarls that could slow efforts to protect against a dangerous pandemic. What the need would be: To gain protection against seasonal flu, most people get vaccinated with one dose of vaccine. Young children who’ve never been vaccinated against flu are an exception; kids ages 6 months to 8 years must get two doses of vaccine, at least four weeks apart, the first time they are vaccinated. Why? Because they are considered to be “naive” to influenza, and their immune systems need to be primed (introduced to flu viruses) and then boosted. Anyone over age 8 is likely to have encountered flu before; they’ve already been primed. One dose is sufficient to acquaint immune systems to the evolved versions of previously encountered seasonal flu viruses. But with a brand-new flu virus—and H5N1 definitely falls into that category for humans—everyone will be naive. So the assumption of pandemic planners is that everyone would need two doses of vaccine in the first season of vaccinating against H5N1. (During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the new virus was distantly related to one that had circulated for much of the previous century, and one dose was adequate for protection. There’s no expectation that would be true with an H5 pandemic.) That math is daunting: The 8.1 billion people worldwide times two is 16.2 billion doses. Babies under the age of 6 months aren’t vaccinated against flu—their immune systems aren’t yet sufficiently developed for it to be effective—so that number would be a bit lower. But there’s always waste in vaccine delivery, so the 16 billion probably isn’t far off.

Speaking of kids, there’s a dynamic at play with H5N1 that wasn’t seen in the Covid pandemic, one that adds to the complexity of vaccinating the planet in a flu pandemic. The vast majority of Covid deaths were in older adults; there were relatively few deaths in children. But flu infections are hardest on older adults and little kids. In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it is estimated that nearly 1,300 children under the age of 17 died, a high toll when compared to a typical flu season. And 2009 was mild, in pandemic terms. Furthermore, kids amplify the transmission of flu in communities, Hatchett said, noting the fall wave of the 2009 pandemic in the U.S. started in late summer, when southern states went back to school. A really bad pandemic could change public opinion rapidly, but at present it seems unlikely there would be much appetite for closing schools to slow the spread of a new flu virus. School closures are one of the most reviled of the containment measures that were used in the Covid pandemic. “The disease is different. It behaves differently. It has different mortality patterns and different transmission patterns. And we would be in a setup because we’d be coming out of Covid with a Covid mindset and Covid biases that would jeopardize our ability to do the right thing if there were a flu pandemic,” Hatchett said. So while the United States waited into 2022 before starting to vaccinate children against Covid—and some countries didn’t vaccinate children at all—kids will be in the pool of people who need to be vaccinated when the next flu pandemic hits. What the current production capacity is: An assessment of market capacity published by the World Health Organization in January estimated that the combined global supply was 1.2 billion trivalent doses of flu vaccine, which target three flu virus strains at a time. During a pandemic, the vaccine made would target a single virus, the new one. So, in theory, 1.2 billion vaccine doses could become 3.6 billion vaccine doses. More than 85% of those doses are made by seven producers, the WHO analysis said, and over 95% of seasonal vaccine doses are used in high- and upper-middle-income countries, which will almost certainly have first dibs on pandemic vaccines. More on this later. Back to the math. How much vaccine would each person need? The 3.6 billion doses would be enough for 1.8 billion people. But that’s only if the same amount of vaccine used to protect against seasonal flu viruses would protect against H5N1. And there we run into another problem. Research done in the mid-2000s found that H5N1 is poorly immunogenic in people; it doesn’t trigger a strong immune response unless it’s administered in large amounts, or is given with a boosting compound known as an adjuvant that broadly stimulates the immune system. In a seasonal flu shot, each component contains 15 micrograms of antigen or vaccine. In that study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, it took two doses of 90 micrograms—12 times the amount used to protect against a strain in the seasonal vaccine—to induce what’s thought to be a protective response in just over half of the volunteers. In a world where need will outstrip supply, that’s a wholly unworkable dosage. In the years since, multiple studies have been conducted to see whether adjuvants could lower the amount of antigen needed and stretch supplies. They do. Some studies have even suggested fractional doses, with an adjuvant, could be effective. For example, CSL Seqirus, which supplies flu vaccine to the U.S. market and has a licensed pandemic H5N1 vaccine in the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS), showed that 7.5 micrograms, with an adjuvant, would generate what’s thought to be a protective response in a portion of adults. The studies were small, so the range of the estimates is broad, but between 28% and 64% of volunteers ages 18 through 64 and 17% to 57% of volunteers ages 65 and older developed what is thought to be a protective level of antibodies from the 7.5 microgram shot. Related: Why a leading bird flu expert isn’t convinced that the risk H5N1 poses to people has declined. But not all flu vaccine manufacturers use or have proprietary adjuvants. CSL Seqirus and GSK do; Sanofi, a major producer of flu vaccines, currently does not. And the global supply of adjuvants could be a bottleneck in any effort to vaccinate the world against H5N1, experts say. “I would be very curious to know what the global production capacity for the relevant adjuvants that we have data for would be. And I suspect it would be vastly insufficient to what is needed,” Hatchett said. The U.S. has stores of adjuvants in the NPIVS, said David Boucher, director of infectious diseases preparedness and response for the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. How quickly could the U.S. respond? The United States has been doing active pandemic preparedness work for at least the past two decades. It understood that domestic production of flu vaccine would be critical in a pandemic, when borders might close to exports if a situation became dire. (Witness India’s refusal to export Covid vaccines in spring 2021 when it was hit with a huge wave of cases.) The government incentivized development of flu vaccine manufacturing and fill-and-finish operations in the U.S. The country, through ASPR, has worked with flu vaccine manufacturers to develop and test batches of H5N1 vaccines targeting different versions of the virus. H5N1 vaccine has already been tested in children, which will help speed availability for a group that is typically at the end of the testing list. (Manufacturers are reluctant to test vaccines in children until they have lots of adult safety data.) There are currently four types of H5N1 vaccine in the NPIVS, said Boucher. Analysis of the viruses they are based on and the viruses from the cattle outbreaks suggests that two of the stockpiled vaccines are sufficiently close, genetically, to be useful, should this version of the virus take off, the WHO and the CDC have stated. “We have right now two candidate vaccine viruses that are very well matched to the current virus from those we have,” Boucher said. About 10 million doses are being stored in bulk, and “hundreds of thousands” of doses have already been placed in vials. That’s a start. But with two doses needed per person, it would not go very far. Boucher said decisions on who the first doses would go to have yet to be made. Those vaccines haven’t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the agency has a fast-track process for updating flu vaccines, and a lot of recent experience with emergency authorization of pandemic vaccines. It can make this happen fast. “Some fraction” of the doses in the filled vials could be available within weeks, Boucher said, depending on how quickly the regulatory process went. And while the bulk antigen was being put into vials, large-scale manufacturing would kick into gear. He estimated that tens of millions of doses could be manufactured over a four- or five-month period. An ASPR spokesperson later put the figure at about 125 million doses. (Remember, 125 million doses would be enough to vaccinate 62.5 million people, about a fifth of the U.S. population.) Kathleen Neuzil, a longtime influenza vaccine researcher at the University of Maryland who takes over as director of the Fogarty International Center at the National Institutes of Health in early May, studied one of the two stockpiled vaccines that Boucher mentioned. It is based on an H5N8 virus and has the same key component as H5N1. (The major target of a flu vaccine is the hemagglutinin protein on the viruses’ surface, the H in a strain’s name.) Her group tested blood from people vaccinated with it against a virus related to the ones that have been seen in cows, which come from a subgroup of H5N1 known as 2.3.4.4b. Although the vaccine targets a 2.3.4.4c virus—a slightly different clade—the researchers saw good antibody responses in people who had received two 15-microgram doses of the vaccine, with adjuvant. “We had tested this H5N8 vaccine that’s in the stockpile to that strain, and it had pretty good cross reactivity if you use an adjuvant,” Neuzil told STAT. Would the stockpiled vaccine protect us, if H5 triggers a pandemic? Two vaccine and pandemic preparedness experts who used to work for the FDA recently questioned how useful the stockpiled vaccine would be, in an opinion piece in STAT. “Let’s say that by a miracle that it really is a good match, that it’s protective and all that. It’s available in such limited numbers it’s just not meaningful for the response,” Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at FDA and former member of the National Security Council, said in an interview. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said it would be prudent to remember the vaccine experience of the 2009 pandemic when making projections about how effective the stockpiled vaccine might be against a virus that evolves to be able to spread from person to person. A study of how well the vaccine worked then showed good protection for young people but no discernible protection for older adults. “You had the strain in the vaccine. And you still saw a relative lack of protection that you would expect to have with a closely matched virus,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how long it takes to produce additional doses, if they are needed. Making a new type of flu vaccine requires manufacturers to learn how to grow large volumes of the viruses. Some viruses grow better than others; sometimes it takes time to learn how to optimize growth. In 2009, manufacturers initially struggled to produce adequate supply of viruses, delaying rollout of the vaccines. In fact, though tens of millions of Americans were vaccinated against H1N1 in 2009, the fall wave of that pandemic—when the vast majority of U.S. cases occurred—had already largely subsided by the time vaccine doses were available in substantial numbers. (Source: The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, the University of Minnesota) Could mRNA vaccines be a wild card? During the Covid pandemic, messenger RNA vaccines—which are quicker to make because they don’t require growing supplies of virus—hit the market with incredible speed. But it’s not clear what role mRNA vaccines would play in a flu pandemic, if one were to occur soon. Both Pfizer and Moderna, the major mRNA players, are developing flu vaccines they hope to combine with Covid shots in a bid to boost flagging sales of the latter and grab a share of the pretty saturated seasonal flu vaccine market. Both have reported that for influenza A—H5N1 belongs to that large flu family—their vaccines appeared to induce immune responses similar to those seen generated by traditional flu vaccines. Moderna is currently testing an H5N1 vaccine, from the 2.3.4.4b subset of viruses, in people. That trial began last summer. But the trial’s listing in the Clinicaltrials.gov database is cagey about the dosages Moderna is testing, calling them simply dose number 1, 2 and 3. Christopher Ridley, Moderna’s vice president of communications, said the detail was obscured for “competitive reasons.” Given how likely it is for mRNA vaccines to induce unpleasant side effects, especially at higher doses, and given how poorly immunogenic H5N1 viruses are, finding a sweet spot—an mRNA H5 vaccine that would be both effective and tolerable to take—could take some work. Hatchett thinks that regulators will want more data before they embrace mRNA vaccines as a solution in a flu pandemic—though he and others have noted that in a true crisis, “all bets are off.” “My intuition would be that we are still in a vulnerable period when it’s not just an instant solution,” he said of the mRNA option. “I think if we make the proper investments, we could very soon get to the point where we know what the dose needs to be and have mRNA vaccines against avian strains as part of our arsenal and scale it quickly. I just don’t think we’ve worked that through yet.” Trending Now: H5N1 bird flu virus particles found in pasteurized milk but FDA says commercial milk supply appears safe. Boucher said ASPR is looking to add mRNA H5N1 vaccine to the stockpile, having recently issued a request for proposals from manufacturers. It is still assessing the submissions it generated, he said. Seth Berkley, who stepped down last summer after 12 years as CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, raised other questions about mRNA as an option for a pandemic flu response, noting that with the Covid mRNA vaccines, the protection against any infection waned quickly and the vaccines needed to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures, which made them impractical for parts of the world. “But if you were to say, we want to make flu vaccines for the world, would that be mRNA technology? Or … wouldn’t you want a vaccine, probably adjuvanted, that would take a little longer to make, but might be inexpensive and easy to produce and give longer immunity?” Berkeley mused. “We don’t know, but those are the questions that will have to get asked, and they didn’t get asked in Covid because of the emergency we were in.” Will lower-income countries have to wait yet again? In 2009, the Obama administration announced it would donate 10% of the U.S. stocks of vaccine, as they rolled off the manufacturing line, starting after high-risk people in the country were vaccinated. Hatchett was one of the people tasked with running that program. Other countries were persuaded to join, and the WHO led an effort to redistribute vaccine to countries that could not buy their way into the vaccine purchasing lines. Eventually, Hatchett said, about 200 million doses were donated, but by the time they were available, the pandemic had subsided. When the program was wound down in October of 2010, about 80 million doses had been distributed. Fast forward to the Covid pandemic. Nearly 2 billion doses of Covid vaccine were distributed through COVAX, an entity set up by the WHO, Gavi, CEPI, and UNICEF (the United Nation’s Children’s Fund) to try to secure vaccine for countries boxed out of the market. And still, vaccine distribution was hugely inequitable. That fact was part of the inspiration for the ongoing efforts to come up with an international pandemic accord that would try to ensure vaccines, drugs, and other medical essentials are more fairly distributed in the next pandemic. Those efforts have struggled to reach a consensus acceptable to all parties. People who know the flu vaccine market think the dynamics may not be vastly different in the next pandemic than they were in the last two. “I would say even today, it’s true that the countries with the manufacturing capacity will be the countries with the early access to these vaccines,” Neuzil cautioned. An in-depth analysis of global seasonal and pandemic flu vaccine production capacity, led by the WHO and based on 2019 data, showed that low- and middle-income countries made up 38% of the world’s population, but produced 2% of seasonal influenza vaccine. There was no flu vaccine production in Africa, and a Moderna plan to build an mRNA vaccine production facility there was recently shelved, a move the company ascribed to the sharp drop in sales of its Covid vaccine. Hatchett said a problem that existed in 2009 was the fact that high-income countries that bought seasonal flu vaccine had provisions in their contracts that gave them first or early access to pandemic vaccine, if the need arose. When H1N1 emerged, “all of the vaccine that could be produced in Europe was absorbed,” he said. “And I suspect those contingent purchase contracts are probably still in place, and probably you would have the exact same phenomenon again.”", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "Could that record be matched or broken if H5N1 starts a pandemic?", "affirm_transmissible_statement_3": "But a number warned that assuming the successes of Covid vaccine production would automatically influence the speed and scale of pandemic flu vaccine production would be unwise.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_4": "But with a brand-new flu virus—and H5N1 definitely falls into that category for humans—everyone will be naive.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_5": "So the assumption of pandemic planners is that everyone would need two doses of vaccine in the first season of vaccinating against H5N1.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_6": "Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said it would be prudent to remember the vaccine experience of the 2009 pandemic when making projections about how effective the stockpiled vaccine might be against a virus that evolves to be able to spread from person to person.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_7": "But it’s not clear what role mRNA vaccines would play in a flu pandemic, if one were to occur soon.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 6, "affirm_why_statement_1": "But the first signs that H5N1 or any new flu virus was starting to spread from person to person would trigger a race to produce massive amounts of vaccine to try to mitigate the damage a flu pandemic might be expected to cause.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "But with a brand-new flu virus—and H5N1 definitely falls into that category for humans—everyone will be naive.

{"id": "477", "title": "USDA orders H5N1 testing of some dairy cows to limit spread of bird flu", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture moved to try to limit spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus among dairy cattle on Wednesday, issuing a federal order that will require an animal to test negative for the virus before it can be moved across state lines. It also requires laboratories and state veterinarians to report to the USDA any animals that have tested positive for H5N1 or any other influenza A virus. In addition, farms that move cattle across state lines and have animals that test positive for H5N1 or any influenza A virus will be required to open their books to investigators, so they can trace movement of cattle from infected herds. But the first signs that H5N1 or any new flu virus was starting to spread from person to person would trigger a race to produce massive amounts of vaccine to try to mitigate the damage a flu pandemic might be expected to cause. While the 2009 H1N1 pandemic is estimated to have killed about a quarter-million people worldwide severe flu seasons sometimes kill more the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic is believed to have killed between 50 million and 100 million people, many times more than Covid-19. The good news: The world makes a lot of flu vaccine and has been doing it for decades. Regulatory agencies have well-oiled systems to allow manufacturers to update the viruses the vaccines target without having to seek new licenses. The United States even has some H5 vaccine in a stockpile that it believes would offer protection against the version of the H5N1 virus infecting dairy cattle, though there would not be nearly enough doses for the entire country. Related: USDA releases H5N1 bird flu genetic data eagerly awaited by scientists The bad news: The current global production capacity isn’t close to adequate to vaccinate a large portion of the world’s population in the first year of a pandemic. And batches of flu vaccine, often (though not always) produced in hen’s eggs, take months to produce. The Covid pandemic saw vaccine manufacturers around the world pump out unprecedented amounts of vaccine in an extraordinarily short period of time. By February 2022, 14 months after vaccination efforts began, it was estimated that 11 billion doses of vaccine had been produced and delivered. Could that record be matched broken? if H5N1 starts a pandemic? Would the profound inequity of the Covid vaccine distribution, which had affluent countries awash with doses while low-income countries waited for supplies, be remedied or repeated? Experts STAT interviewed suggested that in some respects, the world is better positioned to produce pandemic flu vaccines, if the need arises. But a number warned that assuming the successes of Covid vaccine production would automatically influence the speed and scale of pandemic flu vaccine production would be unwise. “You just have a different [production] system for flu vaccines than we developed on the fly for Covid,” said Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, better known as CEPI, an international organization tasked with spurring development of medical countermeasures for diseases that can cause epidemics and pandemics. “And the … system that we developed for Covid can’t just be repurposed for flu.” Let’s explore some of the ways the world is perhaps better prepared than it was in the past, and some of the snarls that could slow efforts to protect against a dangerous pandemic. What the need would be To gain protection against seasonal flu, most people get vaccinated with one dose of vaccine. Young children who’ve never been vaccinated against flu are an exception; kids ages 6 months to 8 years must get two doses of vaccine, at least four weeks apart, the first time they are vaccinated. Why? Because they are considered to be “naive” to influenza, and their immune systems need to be primed (introduced to flu viruses) and then boosted. Anyone over age 8 is likely to have encountered flu before; they’ve already been primed. One dose is sufficient to acquaint immune systems to the evolved versions of previously encountered seasonal flu viruses. But with a brand-new flu virus and H5N1 definitely falls into that category for humans everyone will be naive. So the assumption of pandemic planners is that everyone would need two doses of vaccine in the first season of vaccinating against H5N1. (During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the new virus was distantly related to one that had circulated for much of the previous century, and one dose was adequate for protection. There’s no expectation that would be true with an H5 pandemic.) That math is daunting: The 8.1 billion people worldwide times two is 16.2 billion doses. Babies under the age of 6 months aren’t vaccinated against flu their immune systems aren’t yet sufficiently developed for it to be effective so that number would be a bit lower. But there’s always waste in vaccine delivery, so the 16 billion probably isn’t far off.

Speaking of kids, there’s a dynamic at play with H5N1 that wasn’t seen in the Covid pandemic, one that adds to the complexity of vaccinating the planet in a flu pandemic. The vast majority of Covid deaths were in older adults; there were relatively few deaths in children. But flu infections are hardest on older adults and little kids. In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it is estimated that nearly 1,300 children under the age of 17 died, a high toll when compared to a typical flu season. And 2009 was mild, in pandemic terms. Furthermore, kids amplify the transmission of flu in communities, Hatchett said, noting the fall wave of the 2009 pandemic in the U.S. started in late summer, when southern states went back to school. A really bad pandemic could change public opinion rapidly, but at present it seems unlikely there would be much appetite for closing schools to slow spread of a new flu virus. School closures are one of the most reviled of the containment measures that were used in the Covid pandemic. “The disease is different. It behaves differently. It has different mortality patterns and different transmission patterns. And we would be in a setup because we’d be coming out of Covid with a Covid mindset and Covid biases that would jeopardize our ability to do the right thing if there were a flu pandemic,” Hatchett said. So while the United States waited into 2022 before starting to vaccinate children against Covid and some countries didn’t vaccinate children at all kids will be in the pool of people who need to be vaccinated when the next flu pandemic hits. What the current production capacity is An assessment of market capacity published by the World Health Organization in January estimated that the combined global supply was 1.2 billion trivalent doses of flu vaccine, which target three flu virus strains at a time. During a pandemic, the vaccine made would target a single virus, the new one. So, in theory, 1.2 billion vaccine doses could become 3.6 billion vaccine doses. More than 85% of those doses are made by seven producers, the WHO analysis said, and over 95% of seasonal vaccine doses are used in high- and upper-middle income countries, which will almost certainly have first dibs on pandemic vaccines. More on this later. Back to the math. How much vaccine would each person need? The 3.6 billion doses would be enough for 1.8 billion people. But that’s only if the same amount of vaccine used to protect against seasonal flu viruses would protect against H5N1. And there we run into another problem. Research done in the mid-2000s found that H5N1 is poorly immunogenic in people; it doesn’t trigger a strong immune response unless it’s administered in large amounts, or is given with a boosting compound known as an adjuvant that broadly stimulates the immune system. In a seasonal flu shot, each component contains 15 micrograms of antigen or vaccine. In that study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, it took two doses of 90 micrograms 12 times the amount used to protect against a strain in the seasonal vaccine to induce what’s thought to be a protective response in just over half of the volunteers. In a world where need will outstrip supply, that’s a wholly unworkable dosage. In the years since, multiple studies have been conducted to see whether adjuvants could lower the amount of antigen needed and stretch supplies. They do. Some studies have even suggested fractional doses, with an adjuvant, could be effective. For example, CSL Seqirus, which supplies flu vaccine to the U.S. market and has a licensed pandemic H5N1 vaccine in the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS), showed that 7.5 micrograms, with an adjuvant, would generate what’s thought to be a protective response in a portion of adults. The studies were small, so the range of the estimates is broad, but between 28% and 64% of volunteers ages 18 through 64 and 17% to 57% of volunteers ages 65 and older developed what is thought to be a protective level of antibodies from the 7.5 microgram shot. Related: Why a leading bird flu expert isn’t convinced that the risk H5N1 poses to people has declined But not all flu vaccine manufacturers use or have proprietary adjuvants. CSL Seqirus and GSK do; Sanofi, a major producer of flu vaccines, currently does not. And the global supply of adjuvants could be a bottleneck in any effort to vaccinate the world against H5N1, experts say. “I would be very curious to know what the global production capacity for the relevant adjuvants that we have data for would be. And I suspect it would be vastly insufficient to what is needed,” Hatchett said. The U.S. has stores of adjuvants in the NPIVS, said David Boucher, director of infectious diseases preparedness and response for the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. How quickly could the U.S. respond? The United States has been doing active pandemic preparedness work for at least the past two decades. It understood that domestic production of flu vaccine would be critical in a pandemic, when borders might close to exports if a situation became dire. (Witness India’s refusal to export Covid vaccines in spring 2021 when it was hit with a huge wave of cases.) The government incentivized development of flu vaccine manufacturing and fill-and-finish operations in the U.S. The country, through ASPR, has worked with flu vaccine manufacturers to develop and test batches of H5N1 vaccines targeting different versions of the virus. H5N1 vaccine has already been tested in children, which will help speed availability for a group that is typically at the end of the testing list. (Manufacturers are reluctant to test vaccines in children until they have lots of adult safety data.) There are currently four types of H5N1 vaccine in the NPIVS, said Boucher. Analysis of the viruses they are based on and the viruses from the cattle outbreaks suggests that two of the stockpiled vaccines are sufficiently close, genetically, to be useful, should this version of the virus take off, the WHO and the CDC have stated. “We have right now two candidate vaccine viruses that are very well matched to the current virus from those we have,” Boucher said. About 10 million doses are being stored in bulk, and “hundreds of thousands” of doses have already been placed in vials. That’s a start. But with two doses needed per person, it would not go very far. Boucher said decisions on who the first doses would go to have yet to be made. Those vaccines haven’t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the agency has a fast-track process for updating flu vaccines, and a lot of recent experience with emergency authorization of pandemic vaccines. It can make this happen fast. “Some fraction” of the doses in the filled vials could be available within weeks, Boucher said, depending on how quickly the regulatory process went. And while the bulk antigen was being put into vials, large-scale manufacturing would kick into gear. He estimated that tens of millions of doses could be manufactured over a four- or five-month period. An ASPR spokesperson later put the figure at about 125 million doses. (Remember, 125 million doses would be enough to vaccinate 62.5 million people, about a fifth of the U.S. population.) Kathleen Neuzil, a longtime influenza vaccine researcher at the University of Maryland who takes over as director of the Fogarty International Center at the National Institutes of Health in early May, studied one of the two stockpiled vaccines that Boucher mentioned. It is based on an H5N8 virus and has the same key component as H5N1. (The major target of a flu vaccine is the hemagglutinin protein on the viruses’ surface, the H in a strain’s name.) Her group tested blood from people vaccinated with it against a virus related to the ones that have been seen in cows, which come from a subgroup of H5N1 known as 2.3.4.4b. Although the vaccine targets a 2.3.4.4c virus a slightly different clade the researchers saw good antibody responses in people who had received two 15-microgram doses of the vaccine, with adjuvant. “We had tested this H5N8 vaccine that’s in the stockpile to that strain, and it had pretty good cross reactivity if you use an adjuvant,” Neuzil told STAT. Would the stockpiled vaccine protect us, if H5 triggers a pandemic? Two vaccine and pandemic preparedness experts who used to work for the FDA recently questioned how useful the stockpiled vaccine would be, in an opinion piece in STAT. “Let’s say that by a miracle that it really is a good match, that it’s protective and all that. It’s available in such limited numbers it’s just not meaningful for the response,” Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at FDA and former member of the National Security Council, said in an interview. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said it would be prudent to remember the vaccine experience of the 2009 pandemic when making projections about how effective the stockpiled vaccine might be against a virus that evolves to be able to spread from person to person. A study of how well the vaccine worked then showed good protection for young people but no discernible protection for older adults. “You had the strain in the vaccine. And you still saw a relative lack of protection that you would expect to have with a closely matched virus,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how long it takes to produce additional doses, if they are needed. Making a new type of flu vaccine requires manufacturers to learn how to grow large volumes of the viruses. Some viruses grow better than others; sometimes it takes time to learn how to optimize growth. In 2009, manufacturers initially struggled to produce adequate supply of viruses, delaying rollout of the vaccines. In fact, though tens of millions of Americans were vaccinated against H1N1 in 2009, the fall wave of that pandemic when the vast majority of U.S. cases occurred had already largely subsided by the time vaccine doses were available in substantial numbers. (Source: The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, the University of Minnesota) Could mRNA vaccines be a wild card? During the Covid pandemic, messenger RNA vaccines which are quicker to make because they don’t require growing supplies of virus hit the market with incredible speed. But it’s not clear what role mRNA vaccines would play in a flu pandemic, if one were to occur soon. Both Pfizer and Moderna, the major mRNA players, are developing flu vaccines they hope to combine with Covid shots in a bid to boost flagging sales of the latter and grab a share of the pretty saturated seasonal flu vaccine market. Both have reported that for influenza A H5N1 belongs to that large flu family their vaccines appeared to induce immune responses similar to those seen generated by traditional flu vaccines. Moderna is currently testing an H5N1 vaccine, from the 2.3.4.4b subset of viruses, in people. That trial began last summer. But the trial’s listing in the Clinicaltrials.gov database is cagey about the dosages Moderna is testing, calling them simply dose number 1, 2 and 3. Christopher Ridley, Moderna’s vice president of communications, said the detail was obscured for “competitive reasons.” Given how likely it is for mRNA vaccines to induce unpleasant side effects, especially at higher doses, and given how poorly immunogenic H5N1 viruses are, finding a sweet spot an mRNA H5 vaccine that would be both effective and tolerable to take could take some work. Hatchett thinks that regulators will want more data before they embrace mRNA vaccines as a solution in a flu pandemic though he and others have noted that in a true crisis, “all bets are off.” “My intuition would be that we are still in a vulnerable period when it’s not just an instant solution,” he said of the mRNA option. “I think if we make the proper investments, we could very soon get to the point where we know what the dose needs to be and have mRNA vaccines against avian strains as part of our arsenal and scale it quickly. I just don’t think we’ve worked that through yet.” Trending Now: H5N1 bird flu virus particles found in pasteurized milk but FDA says commercial milk supply appears safe Boucher said ASPR is looking to add mRNA H5N1 vaccine to the stockpile, having recently issued a request for proposals from manufacturers. It is still assessing the submissions it generated, he said. Seth Berkley, who stepped down last summer after 12 years as CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, raised other questions about mRNA as an option for a pandemic flu response, noting that with the Covid mRNA vaccines, the protection against any infection waned quickly and the vaccines needed to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures, which made them impractical for parts of the world. “But if you were to say, we want to make flu vaccines for the world, would that be mRNA technology? Or … wouldn’t you want a vaccine, probably adjuvanted, that would take a little longer to make, but might be inexpensive and easy to produce and give longer immunity?” Berkeley mused. “We don’t know, but those are the questions that will have to get asked, and they didn’t get asked in Covid because of the emergency we were in.” Will lower-income countries have to wait yet again? In 2009, the Obama administration announced it would donate 10% of the U.S. stocks of vaccine, as they rolled off the manufacturing line, starting after high-risk people in the country were vaccinated. Hatchett was one of the people tasked with running that program. Other countries were persuaded to join, and the WHO led an effort to redistribute vaccine to countries that could not buy their way into the vaccine purchasing lines. Eventually, Hatchett said, about 200 million doses were donated, but by the time they were available, the pandemic had subsided. When the program was wound down in October of 2010, about 80 million doses had been distributed. Fast forward to the Covid pandemic. Nearly 2 billion doses of Covid vaccine were distributed through COVAX, an entity set up by the WHO, Gavi, CEPI, and UNICEF (the United Nation’s Children’s Fund) to try to secure vaccine for countries boxed out of the market. And still, vaccine distribution was hugely inequitable. That fact was part of the inspiration for the ongoing efforts to come up with an international pandemic accord that would try to ensure vaccines, drugs, and other medical essentials are more fairly distributed in the next pandemic. Those efforts have struggled to reach a consensus acceptable to all parties. People who know the flu vaccine market think the dynamics may not be vastly different in the next pandemic than they were in the last two. “I would say even today, it’s true that the countries with the manufacturing capacity will be the countries with the early access to these vaccines,” Neuzil cautioned. An in-depth analysis of global seasonal and pandemic flu vaccine production capacity, led by the WHO and based on 2019 data, showed that low- and middle-income countries made up 38% of the world’s population, but produced 2% of seasonal influenza vaccine. There was no flu vaccine production in Africa, and a Moderna plan to build an mRNA vaccine production facility there was recently shelved, a move the company ascribed to the sharp drop in sales of its Covid vaccine. Hatchett said a problem that existed in 2009 was the fact that high-income countries that bought seasonal flu vaccine had provisions in their contracts that gave them first or early access to pandemic vaccine, if the need arose. When H1N1 emerged, “all of the vaccine that could be produced in Europe was absorbed,” he said. “And I suspect those contingent purchase contracts are probably still in place, and probably you would have the exact same phenomenon again.”", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "But with a brand-new flu virus and H5N1 definitely falls into that category for humans everyone will be naive.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_3": "Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said it would be prudent to remember the vaccine experience of the 2009 pandemic when making projections about how effective the stockpiled vaccine might be against a virus that evolves to be able to spread from person to person.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 2, "affirm_why_statement_1": "But the first signs that H5N1 or any new flu virus was starting to spread from person to person would trigger a race to produce massive amounts of vaccine to try to mitigate the damage a flu pandemic might be expected to cause.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "But with a brand-new flu virus and H5N1 definitely falls into that category for humans everyone will be naive.

{"id": "478", "title": "Traces of bird flu virus have been found in milk. What's going on? Is dairy safe?", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "Fragments of the virus that causes bird flu have been found in samples of pasteurized milk, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday, but officials aren't concerned about danger to humans from drinking store-bought milk at this time. Officials told reporters on Wednesday that the milk tested positive for presence of the virus, but the results do not indicate that the virus is currently infectious, as the pasteurization process works to inactivate viruses. The initial positive samples came from a limited number of tests done by researchers on milk at grocery stores. Federal agencies are now doing their own, more robust tests. The FDA said it is conducting further analysis on the positive samples, and is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state partners to investigate. \"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" Donald Prater, the acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA, told reporters. On Wednesday, officials announced a new federal order that will require all dairy cattle to be tested for bird flu before being transported across state lines. Any cows that test positive will have to wait 30 days and retest before being moved, said administrator for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Michael Watson. The avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has recently infected herds of dairy cows in several states, including Texas, Kansas and Michigan. Herds in New Mexico and Idaho are presumed infected, officials said. Both the FDA and the USDA said the current commercial milk supply is safe because of the pasteurization process and the \"diversion or destruction of milk from sick cows.\" The agency pledged to take the situation seriously and release results from multiple studies in the coming days or weeks. What is bird flu? Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a disease that's caused by an avian influenza Type A virus infection, according to the CDC. The disease primarily spreads through contact with infected birds, which can infect their respiratory tract and intestines, according to the CDC. Infected birds can shed viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces. Bird flu is very contagious among birds, and some of the viruses can sicken or kill certain domesticated species, including chickens, ducks and turkeys. Is anyone at risk from drinking milk? Pasteurized milk, which makes up 99% of milk produced on dairy farms and sold in stores, is treated to make sure any viruses in the milk are dead. Experts say drinking this kind of milk is safe, even if fragments of bird flu have been found in some samples. However, raw milk does not receive this treatment. Is raw milk safe to drink? The FDA says people should not drink raw milk. The agency also says the dairy industry shouldn't manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including cheese made with raw milk, from any cows showing symptoms of illness or exposed to other cows that have bird flu. How did virus fragments get into milk? While the pasteurization process is designed to make milk safe by inactivating viruses, it doesn't destroy the virus fragments. \"It's important to understand that fragments, such as genetic material, of those pathogens can still be found in pasteurized milk,\" Prater said. Still, \"pasteurization is very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses, like H5N1 in milk from cows and other species.\" Officials said Wednesday that current studies on how effectively pasteurization kills off bird flu virus are underway, but the process has proven effective in similarly acting viruses for decades, and thermal inactivation has been successful at inactivating bird flu in eggs, which occurs at a lower temperature than in milk. The FDA and its partners are testing samples of milk from store shelves and conducting further analysis on any that show they have bird flu virus to ensure that the virus fragments are inactive, Prater said. Those results will be available in the coming days, he said. What is pasteurization? Named after the scientist Louis Pasteur, pasteurization is a treatment process that applies heat to liquids for short amounts of time, according to the Virginia Department of Health. The process destroys pathogenic microorganisms in some foods and beverages that can cause spoilage and prolongs storage time. Pasteurization was adopted by the FDA as a public health measure to kill dangerous bacteria and viruses, and largely eliminates the risk of getting sick from milk. In 1987, the FDA prohibited the interstate sale of raw, or unpasteurized milk. Can humans get bird flu? There have been a few cases of humans being infected with various strains of bird flu, usually through close contact with sick or dead animals. But experts say the risk to humans is currently low because the disease has not mutated to spread person-to-person. There have been two human cases in the U.S. tied to this strain of bird flu. Among them: On April 1, Texas health officials said a person became infected with bird flu after close contact with infected cows. The CDC said the only symptom reported by the patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis. Public health officials told reporters that 23 people have been tested for bird flu during the current outbreak among cattle and 44 people are being actively monitored after suspected exposure. Officials say risk to public health remains low. The CDC says most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said \"we have not observed changes to the virus' genetic makeup that would suggest an enhanced the ability to spread to humans or among humans.\" \"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, previously told USA TODAY. \"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\" Contributing: Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY.", "media_outlet": "USA Today", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "But experts say the risk to humans is currently low because the disease has not mutated to spread person-to-person.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "\"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, previously told USA TODAY.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_3": "\"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\"", "affirm_transmissible_count": 3, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Experts say the risk to humans is currently low because the disease has not mutated to spread person-to-person.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said 'we have not observed changes to the virus' genetic makeup that would suggest an enhanced the ability to spread to humans or among humans.'", "affirm_why_statement_3": "Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, previously told USA TODAY.

{"id": "479", "title": "Bird flu virus in grocery milk shows wider reach", "date": "2024-04-24", "fulltext": "Viral fragments of bird flu have been identified in samples of milk taken from grocery store shelves in the United States, a finding that does not necessarily suggest a threat to human health but indicates the avian flu virus is more widespread among dairy herds than previously thought, according to two public health officials and a public health expert who was briefed on the issue. The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it had been testing milk samples throughout the dairy production process and confirmed the detection of viral particles in some of the samples, but it declined to provide details. The presence of genetic fragments of the virus in milk is not unexpected. Pasteurization typically works to inactivate pathogens, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. It generally does not remove genetic material, Nuzzo said, but typically renders pathogens unable to cause harm to people. The greater concern, however, is that it's showing up in a lot more samples, meaning the infection is more widespread in dairy herds than we thought, said one public health official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share information not yet made public. In a four-page statement, the FDA said some of the samples collected have indicated the presence of the bird flu virus based on testing that detects viral particles but does not distinguish whether they are active or dead. The finding of virus does not mean that the sample contains an intact, infectious pathogen, the agency's statement said. Additional laboratory testing is underway to grow the virus in cells and in fertilized eggs, the latter being the gold standard for sensitive detection of active, infectious virus, the FDA said. Importantly, additional testing is required to determine whether intact pathogen is still present and if it remains infectious, which determines whether there is any risk of illness associated with consuming the product, the FDA statement said. FDA officials said results are expected in the next few days to weeks. To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe, the agency said in its statement. Officials and experts did not have additional details about the number of milk samples that were positive for particles of bird flu or where the samples originated. Although this strain of avian flu has been circulating for more than 20 years, its leap into cows is of substantial concern, surprising even longtime observers of the virus. More than two dozen livestock herds in at least eight states have been infected with avian flu since March 25, prompting investigations by federal and state officials. For weeks, key federal agencies have expressed confidence in the safety of the commercial milk supply, including pasteurized products sold at grocery stores. The FDA has highlighted data showing pasteurization inactivates other viruses and pointed to studies showing that the pasteurization process for eggs - which occurs at a lower temperature than what is used for milk - deactivates the highly pathogenic avian influenza. The International Dairy Foods Association, which represents the nation's dairy manufacturing and marketing industry, said that viral fragments are nothing more than evidence that the virus is dead. Milk and milk products produced and processed in the United States are among the safest in the world, spokesman Matt Herrick wrote in an email, adding that viral fragments are simply indicative of pasteurization doing its job effectively and protecting our commercial milk supply. In recent weeks, multiple experts expressed confidence that the pasteurization process ensures there is no threat to the safety of the nation's milk supply but said the federal government should still perform tests to confirm that is the case. Flu is a fairly wimpy virus, meaning it is fairly readily inactivated, said Richard J. Webby, a virologist at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. But that's something that has to be tested. One case of avian flu has been reported in a Texas farmworker in recent weeks, only the second human case ever of bird flu in the United States. So far, the virus has not acquired the ability to spread efficiently in people. But as it is able to jump from animal to animal, prospects increase for it mutating to cause sustained person-to-person transmission - a development that could fuel a pandemic.

{"id": "481", "title": "One in Five Milk Samples Nationwide Shows Genetic Traces of Bird Flu", "date": "2024-04-25", "fulltext": "There is no evidence that the milk is unsafe to drink, scientists say. But the survey result strongly hints that the outbreak may be widespread. Federal regulators have discovered fragments of bird flu virus in roughly 20 percent of retail milk samples tested in a nationally representative study, the Food and Drug Administration said in an online update on Thursday. Samples from parts of the country that are known to have dairy herds infected with the virus were more likely to test positive, the agency said. Regulators said that there is no evidence that this milk poses a danger to consumers or that live virus is present in the milk on store shelves, an assessment public health experts have agreed with. But finding traces of the virus in such a high share of samples from around the country is the strongest signal yet that the bird flu outbreak in dairy cows is more extensive than the official tally of 33 infected herds across eight states. 'It suggests that there is a whole lot of this virus out there,' said Richard Webby, a virologist and influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Dr. Webby said that he believed it was still possible to eradicate the virus, which is known as H5N1, from the nation's dairy farms. But it will be difficult to design effective control measures without knowing the scope of the outbreak, he said. The findings also raise questions about how the virus has evaded detection and where else it might be silently spreading. Some scientists have criticized the federal testing strategy as too limited to reveal the true extent of viral spread. Until Wednesday, when the Department of Agriculture announced mandatory testing of dairy cows moving across state lines, testing of cows had been voluntary and primarily focused on cows with obvious symptoms. As of Wednesday, just 23 people had been tested for the virus, while 44 people were being monitored after exposure to it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A widespread outbreak in cows would pose a greater risk to farm workers, the dairy industry and public health more broadly. Sustained spread among cows would give the virus more opportunities to acquire mutations that make it more transmissible among humans. The F.D.A. did not provide details on Thursday regarding the number or sources of the samples. 'You'd want to go not just to the places you knew there was activity and cows—you'd want to go to places where at least there's no reported bird flu,' Dr. Webby said. Experts believe that the process of pasteurization, in which milk is briefly heated, should inactivate this bird flu virus, which is known as H5N1. 'And when you destroy the virus, it's going to release genetic material,' said Samuel Alcaine, a microbiologist and food scientist at Cornell University. The genetic fragments left behind are not capable of causing infection. 'It's not surprising to find them in milk,' he added. 'It doesn't mean that the milk is not safe.' Federal officials are still conducting the time-intensive tests required to determine whether any viable virus remains in the milk after pasteurization. Scientists have said that prospect is very unlikely. Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a news briefing Wednesday that some federally sponsored researchers had tested for live virus in retail milk but had not found any, a sign that pasteurization had killed the virus before the milk reached grocery shelves. Dr. Marrazzo cautioned that while the results were a small sample, the findings were 'welcome news.' 'To really understand the scope here, we need to wait for the F.D.A. efforts,' she said. Finding traces of the virus in 20 percent of commercial milk samples does not mean that 20 percent of the nation's dairy herds are infected, experts cautioned. 'It's too early to try to do that back-of-the-napkin kind of calculation,' Dr. Alcaine said. Milk from several farms is typically pooled. If the virus turns up in lots of milk samples drawn from one pool, it could mean that many cows are infected—or that a smaller number of infected cows are shedding large quantities of virus, Dr. Alcaine said. Even in the latter case, however, a 20 percent positivity rate would suggest far more than 33 herds are infected, he noted. In the Wednesday news briefing, Dr. Donald A. Prater, the acting director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, pointed to the novelty of the research effort. No studies have ever been completed on the effects of pasteurization on the bird flu virus in milk, he said. Regulators were examining milk at various points in the commercial supply chain, he added, including milk on grocery shelves, as well as studying potential differences among milk products, such as those between whole milk and cream, Dr. Prater said.", "media_outlet": "NYTimes", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Sustained spread among cows would give the virus more opportunities to acquire mutations that make it more transmissible among humans.", "affirm_why_count": 1, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "Regulators said that there is no evidence that this milk poses a danger to consumers or that live virus is present in the milk on store shelves, an assessment public health experts have agreed with.", "deny_transmissible_statement_3": "Scientists have said that prospect is very unlikely.", "deny_transmissible_count": 2, "deny_why_statement_1": "Experts believe that the process of pasteurization, in which milk is briefly heated, should inactivate this bird flu virus, which is known as H5N1.", "deny_why_statement_2": "The genetic fragments left behind are not capable of causing infection.", "deny_why_statement_3": "Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a news briefing Wednesday that some federally sponsored researchers had tested for live virus in retail milk but had not found any, a sign that pasteurization had killed the virus before the milk reached grocery shelves.", "deny_why_count": 3, "deny_keywords_count": 0}

{"id": "483", "title": "Early tests of H5N1 prevalence in milk suggest U.S. bird flu outbreak in cows is widespread", "date": "2024-04-25", "fulltext": "Andrew Bowman, a veterinary epidemiologist at Ohio State University, had a hunch. He had been struck by the huge amounts of H5N1 virus he'd seen in milk from cows infected with the bird flu and thought that at least some virus was getting off of farms and going downstream into store shelves. He knew the Food and Drug Administration was working on its own national survey of the milk supply. But he was impatient. So he and a graduate student went on a road trip: They collected 150 commercial milk products from around the Midwest, representing dairy processing plants in 10 different states, including some where herds have tested positive for H5N1. Genetic testing found viral RNA in 58 samples, he told STAT. The researchers expect additional lab studies currently underway to show that those samples don’t contain live virus with the capability to cause human infections, meaning that the risk of pasteurized milk to consumer health is still very low. But the prevalence of viral genetic material in the products they sampled suggest that the H5N1 outbreak is likely far more widespread in dairy cows than official counts indicate. So far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported 33 herds in eight states have tested positive for H5N1. “The fact that you can go into a supermarket and 30% to 40% of those samples test positive, that suggests there’s more of the virus around than is currently being recognized,” said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who has been analyzing the samples at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., where he heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy Earlier this week, the FDA announced that its effort had found evidence of the H5N1 virus in samples of milk purchased from store shelves, but it provided no detailed results. On Thursday, during an online symposium hosted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the FDA disclosed a high-level readout from the agency’s investigation. Results returned Thursday morning showed PCR-positive milk in 20% of samples, “maybe with some preponderance for areas with known herds,” said Donald Prater, acting director of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. He did not say how many samples the FDA had analyzed or from what geographic area. The testing by PCR polymerase chain reaction turned up only genetic traces of the virus, not evidence that it’s alive or infectious. The FDA has been adamant that H5N1, which is heat-sensitive, is very likely killed through the process of pasteurization. The agency is still assessing those samples for viral viability by attempting to grow virus from milk found to contain RNA from H5N1. The FDA plans to release results of those studies in the coming days. On Wednesday, Jeanne Marrazzo, the new director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told reporters that a team of NIAID-funded researchers had early data to suggest that pasteurization does appear to be effective. The team that produced that data the St. Jude and OSU groups told STAT that it has so far analyzed four samples of store-bought milk that had tested positive via PCR for H5N1 genetic material. “We’ve done the viral growth assays to see if we can recover any virus from them and we can’t,” Webby said.

{"id": "484", "title": "U.S. requires more cows tested for bird flu", "date": "2024-04-25", "fulltext": "Dairy cows must be tested for bird flu before moving across state lines, under a federal order issued Wednesday, as evidence mounts that the virus is more widespread than feared among cows in the United States. Biden administration officials said the move is meant to contain transmission of the virus known as H5N1 and to reduce the threat to livestock, but they maintained that the risk to humans remains low. The trajectory of the outbreak has drawn public health concerns because it marks the first time bird flu has moved to cows. The virus is far more disruptive to the poultry industry, killing chickens and forcing mass culling of flocks. It generally causes mild or no sickness in cows. But greater transmission in mammals, particularly one regularly exposed to people, increases the risk that the virus could evolve to the point that it spreads more easily in humans. An order issued by the U.S. Agriculture Department that takes effect Monday requires every lactating dairy cow to be tested before moving across state lines. Cows carrying the virus would have to wait 30 days and test negative before being moved, officials said. Positive test results would trigger additional requirements for herd owners to disclose information, including the movement of animals, to aid epidemiologic investigations, and for laboratories and state veterinarians to report cases to the USDA. 'Requiring positive test reporting will help USDA better understand this disease and testing before interstate movement will limit the spread of the virus,' Mike Watson, administrator of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told reporters. 'This is an evolving situation, and we are treating it seriously and with urgency,' he said. The testing mandate could help overcome reluctance from some milk producers to allow testing in their herds, Watson said. The cost of mandatory testing would be reimbursed by the agency. Watson said federal officials are also working with state counterparts to potentially expand testing of cows when they are moved within a state. The nation has roughly 8 million lactating cows, according to estimates, though it's unclear how often they are moved across state lines. Watson did not provide an estimate for how many cows would be tested under the new order, though he described it as a 'significant number.' He said labs have enough capacity to handle the increase and turn around results within days. The National Milk Producers Federation, an industry group, called the USDA's testing order 'appropriate.' 'Dairy farmers stand ready to take a proactive approach to ensuring that we better understand the spread of the virus, do what we can to limit that spread, and ensure the health of our animals and workers,' Gregg Doud, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement. Voluntary testing protocols for cows, limited until now to those with symptoms, has drawn criticism from public health experts. They say the true toll of the virus is probably larger than official tallies confirming avian flu in dairy cows in eight states, as well as one human case in a Texas farmworker. That person has recovered. 'We are only really starting to understand the extent of it now,' said Angela Rasmussen, principal research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. 'The testing requirements are very warranted because certainly there are economic incentives for producers to not test.' Testing uncovered fragments of the virus in milk sold at grocery stores, another sign that the virus is more prevalent in cows than official tallies show, including in asymptomatic cows. Federal officials stressed that existing research suggests pasteurization of milk and other milk products such as ice cream and cheese renders the virus unable to infect humans. Additional reviews, including the virus's presence in other dairy products such as cream, are underway, with some results expected within days or weeks. 'We have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,' said Don Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration. He also cautioned, 'We also know that assessments can change as we learn more, and we will be transparent about any changes based on emerging data.'", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "But greater transmission in mammals, particularly one regularly exposed to people, increases the risk that the virus could evolve to the point that it spreads more easily in humans.", "affirm_why_count": 1, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "Biden administration officials said the move is meant to contain transmission of the virus known as H5N1 and to reduce the threat to livestock, but they maintained that the risk to humans remains low.", "deny_transmissible_statement_3": "'We have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,' said Don Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration.", "deny_transmissible_count": 2, "deny_why_statement_1": "Federal officials stressed that existing research suggests pasteurization of milk and other milk products such as ice cream and cheese renders the virus unable to infect humans.", "deny_why_count": 1, "deny_keywords_count": 0}
{"id": "485", "title": "American cows now have bird flu, too �ut it� time for planning, not panic", "date": "2024-04-26", "fulltext": "This is not a repeat of the Covid pandemic. Yet global governments should follow the US and prepare a response. Avian flu, or H5N1, is making headlines in the United States. The past few years have seen concerning signs of it spreading across the world—whether in chickens in Britain, sea lions in Peru, or Caspian seals in Russia. This time, it has been confirmed in American cows, and the World Health Organization has warned that the risk of it spreading to humans is of enormous concern. While it is early days, the hypothesis is that in late 2023, a single cow was infected by coming into contact with infected birds' faeces, or having infected dead birds in its feed. This began cow-to-cow transmission, and potentially even cow-to-bird transmission. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also confirmed one human case of H5N1 in a farm worker, which could either represent cow-to-human (not seen before) or bird-to-human transmission. Since being identified in late March this year (meaning it was spreading for months among cattle unnoticed), the virus has been confirmed in 33 herds in eight states. Given how infectious H5N1 is (the R number can be as high as 100 among birds—meaning each infected bird could infect 100 others—and is still unknown for cows), and the fact cows are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, it's likely that the spread is much farther across the country, and has perhaps reached outside the US to importers of US cattle. The US Food and Drug Administration also noted that it had found traces of the virus in roughly one in five commercially bought milk samples through PCR testing, which detects both live and dead virus fragments. Further testing is being done by the FDA to confirm that pasteurisation kills the virus; early research has found that live virus could not be grown from the milk. The risk to the general population is still considered low, given H5N1 does not appear to transmit from human to human. Those most at risk are farm and poultry workers close to infected animals who get the virus in their eyes, nose or mouth, or inhale droplets at close range. However, the confirmed mammal-to-mammal transmission in the US is concerning to researchers given the potential for further mutations through intermediaries, such as cows, cats or pigs. If mutations enable human-to-human spread, avian flu would become the top priority for governments around the world. The fatality rate is estimated by the World Health Organization at 52%, including young people. The US government is preparing for this scenario with a testing, treatment and vaccine plan. They confirmed this week in a press briefing that Tamiflu, a flu antiviral, is seen to be an effective treatment and is being stockpiled. Two candidate vaccines, which have been stockpiled in the US, also look well matched to this strain. We also know (all too well) that respiratory viruses spread rapidly and are very hard to contain without restrictive measures. But this is a totally different situation to SARS-CoV-2, when it took a year to develop testing, treatments and vaccines for a novel virus—we are much better prepared. The infected cows across the pond have not triggered a UK government briefing or response yet, given that it is seen so far as a US problem, and we import our beef largely from the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands. Unlike poultry, where even one infected bird results in the culling of the entire flock, there's no talk of killing infected cows. They can cost up to $2,500 each, are largely symptom-free, and there's resistance from farmers to having their herds tested given the impact on their business and sales. There is no simple answer for how to contain the virus in cattle, and resolve the tension between human health imperatives and the agricultural industry. In addition, the medical world and veterinary community are notoriously bad at communicating and working together. Prof Rebecca Katz, co-author of The Outbreak Atlas, said: \"This is a perfect example of the importance of operationalising One Health [a unified approach to optimising the health of humans, animals and ecosystems] and collaborations between the animal and human health sectors.\" The main message is there's no need to panic, and this is not a repeat of the Covid-19 pandemic. H5N1 spreading mammal-to-mammal marks a step-change in the development of the disease, and there is an increased risk for humans in close contact with farms in the US. Even if it does spread into humans, the US government seems to be ahead of the curve in preparing a response plan to limit the impact on lives and livelihoods. But other governments would be wise to take heed and plan for all scenarios.

{"id": "486", "title": "Early test results show pasteurized milk with traces of H5N1 virus isn't infectious, FDA says", "date": "2024-04-26", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Early tests of pasteurized milk — purchased at grocery stores in areas with cows that have tested positive for H5N1 influenza or bird flu — suggest that it is not infectious and wouldn't be able to make people sick, the US Food and Drug Administration said Friday. The FDA has been testing samples of pasteurized milk in which traces of the H5N1 virus have been detected, inoculating fertilized eggs with samples of the milk and waiting to see whether the virus can grow. Egg inoculation tests like these are considered the 'gold-standard' for determining whether live virus is present, the FDA said. Results of some of those egg inoculation tests are coming in, and the agency said they are reassuring. Additionally, tests of infant and toddler formula made with powdered milk did not detect any traces of the H5N1 virus. 'These results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,' the FDA said in an update Friday. On Thursday, the agency said that about 1 out of 5 milk samples it has tested from grocery stores has tested positive for gene fragments from the virus. The FDA said it found more positive samples near areas where herds are known to be infected, but it didn't say specifically where the milk samples had tested positive. The FDA explained that finding traces of the H5N1 virus in milk doesn't necessarily mean it would make someone sick. Most milk in the United States is pasteurized, or heated briefly, to kill pathogens. That process has been shown to kill viruses like H5N1, but the agency says it is doing additional tests to make sure that still holds true in this instance. 'To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe. Results from multiple studies will be made available in the next few days to weeks,' the agency said. Dr. Eric Topol, founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the finding of viral particles in milk on grocery store shelves means the outbreak is probably more widespread than we've known. 'The dissemination to cows is far greater than we have been led to believe,' Topol said in an email Tuesday. 'The FDA assurance that the dairy supply is safe is nice, but it's not based on extensive assessment yet, which they acknowledge, and won't engender trust and confidence because it comes in the wake of USDA mishandling,' he added. The US Department of Agriculture confirmed in late March that it had detected highly pathogenic avian influenza in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas, which was the first time a virus that has been decimating bird populations around the globe had shown up in cattle. Since then, infected cows have been confirmed in more than 30 farms across nine states. Scientists have said the USDA is sharing too little information about the virus and too slowly. The infected cows stopped eating as much as they usually did, and their milk became thickened and discolored. Veterinarians running tests on the animals found that the milk was teeming with the virus, although samples from their lungs didn't show much evidence of infection, leading the doctors to believe that the animals' mammary glands were directly infected, perhaps through shared milking equipment. Researchers are still trying to determine how cows initially became infected and how the virus is spreading between animals. Cats that have lived on the same farms as infected cows have died, perhaps after exposure to their milk. The FDA said Tuesday that milk from sick cows is being 'diverted or destroyed,' while milk sold in interstate commerce is being pasteurized, a process that heats it briefly to kill microbes. 'Even if virus is detected in raw milk, pasteurization is generally expected to eliminate pathogens to a level that does not pose a risk to consumer health,' the FDA stated. The agency said 99% of milk in the commercial supply comes from farms that follow the pasteurized milk ordinance, 'which includes controls that help ensure the safety of dairy products.' However, it noted that pasteurization doesn't render milk completely sterile. For that reason, it has been running tests on milk samples collected at grocery stores across the country. It is also collaborating with the food safety group at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA has long recommended that consumers not drink unpasteurized or raw milk because of the possibility that it may harbor germs that can pose serious health risks. So far, efforts to track the spread of the current outbreak have relied on voluntary reporting. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service keeps a list of diseases that are required to be reported in animals. Although avian influenza, or bird flu, is required to be reported in poultry and wild birds, reporting is not required in cattle. 'No one ever thought it was going to be in cows,' said Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's coordinating center for studies on the ecology of influenza at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital. 'You wouldn't even think of an H5N1 in cows being something you'd ever have to worry about, and I think that's where it's fallen through the cracks a little bit.' Not only does the USDA require reporting of H5N1 in poultry, it rewards producers for reporting at the first sign of illness in their flock and financially compensates them for birds and eggs that are destroyed to contain an outbreak. This approach has encouraged farmers to be forthcoming with information, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. There are no such policies in place to encourage reporting in other livestock. Osterholm said his major worry is that the outbreak could spread to pigs, since farms that keep cows often keep other types of animals, too. Flu viruses enter cells through sialic acids, which serve as entry points. Right now, the H5N1 virus hasn't learned to efficiently access the human version of the sialic acid receptor. Pigs have the same sialic acid receptors as both birds and humans in their respiratory tracts. If H5N1 causes a large outbreak in pigs, Osterholm said, it would give the virus a perfect opportunity to learn to attach to human sialic acids. 'Pigs are a more efficient mixing bowl,' said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics, molecular virology and microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. 'The one thing about where we are in Texas is that, in addition to those cattle, Texas is the epicenter of the feral hog population.' 'In the United States, we have 30% of the nation's feral hogs, 2 to 3 million feral hogs, and so that to me is a potential risk, as well,' he said. The USDA said it has encouraged farmers and ranchers to report cases of sick cattle to state animal health officials. But neither cows nor the people who work or live around them are being widely screened for the infection, which would require informed consent. Testing of wastewater in areas with outbreaks is also being discussed. Instead, the CDC is monitoring emergency department data and flu testing data in areas where H5N1 viruses have been detected in dairy cattle for any unusual trends in flu-like illness, flu or conjunctivitis. 'So far, these data remain in expected ranges, and to date, surveillance systems do not show any unusual trends or activity,' according to information in a statement compiled by officials at the CDC. CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said that 23 people with exposures to H5N1 had been tested, including one person in Texas who previously tested positive.

{"id": "487", "title": "Cattle testing for H5N1 bird flu will be more limited than USDA initially announced", "date": "2024-04-26", "fulltext": "New federal rules aimed at limiting the spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus among dairy cattle go into effect Monday, but detailed guidance documents released Friday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture reveal its mandatory testing order is less stringent than initially described. While that is easing concerns from farmers and veterinarians about the economic and logistical burden of testing, it leaves questions about how effective the testing program will be at containing additional outbreaks. 'More testing is better,' said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of Brown University's Pandemic Center. 'But in many ways this policy is very leaky in terms of how much virus it will allow to move. And because we still don't know what's driving transmission between cows, we should not pin our hopes on this policy making a major dent in the infections we're seeing.' On Wednesday, the USDA issued a federal order requiring farms to ensure lactating dairy cows test negative before being moved across state lines. Laboratories and state veterinarians also must report to the USDA any animals that have tested positive for H5N1 or any other influenza A virus. The guidance issued Friday narrowed the scope of that order. It says farmers only have to test up to 30 animals in a given group. The guidance does not say how farmers should determine which 30 animals to test in larger groups that are being readied to be moved. The USDA did not respond to STAT's questions about the rationale for the 30-animal cap. Jamie Jonker, chief scientific officer for the National Milk Producers Federation, said the group supports the testing program as an important step in response to the outbreak, one that dairy farmers are ready to take 'as part of their responsibility to ensure the safety of their animals and the milk supply.' While pragmatic, researchers who spoke to STAT were split on whether the policy will be effective. Anice Lowen, an influenza researcher at Emory University School of Medicine, told STAT via email that the approach is likely sufficient to detect an H5N1-positive herd. 'I think this approach is reasonable,' she said. Related: USDA orders H5N1 testing of some dairy cows to limit spread of bird flu Nuzzo had concerns, however, that in very large herds, like those around 500 or more, infected animals could be missed. In herds where outbreaks have occurred, only somewhere between 5% to 15% of cows have presented with clinical symptoms, Terry Lehenbauer, a bovine disease epidemiologist and director of the Veterinary Medicine Teaching and Research Center at UC Davis, told STAT. 'My general experience would suggest that there are not a lot of lactating cattle that get shipped interstate on a regular basis, so we're probably looking at fairly small numbers of animals that will be required,' he said. The federal order is in recognition of epidemiological evidence that the virus is spreading between cows in affected herds and between herds as cattle are moved. As of April 26, H5N1 outbreaks have been confirmed in 34 dairy herds in nine states, with the first outbreak in Colorado reported Friday. But analysis of viral genomes from cows infected with H5N1, combined with evidence that genetic traces of the virus have been found broadly in milk in grocery stores, indicate that the outbreak is much more widespread. The risk of infection from ingesting milk is believed to be very low because pasteurization should kill the virus. Academic researchers did not find any live virus in a small study of commercial milk products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is conducting its own, much larger study on the viability of virus in milk, results from which are expected in the coming days. On Friday, the FDA issued an update saying that tests of several samples of retail powdered infant and toddler formula were negative, indicating no presence of H5N1 viral fragments or whole virus. It provided no details on the quantity tested. Related: Watch: What we know about traces of H5N1 bird flu found in pasteurized milk Because farmers are required to divert milk from sick animals out of the national food supply, the traces of H5N1 in grocery store products indicates that asymptomatic animals may also be shedding the virus. In an FAQ posted online Thursday, the USDA confirmed that cows without signs of illness can still test positive for virus, acknowledging it had found H5N1 in the lungs of an asymptomatic cow in an affected herd. Under the new rules, cows that are to be moved between states must have samples collected and tested no more than a week prior to transport. A licensed or accredited veterinarian has to collect the samples between 3 and 10 milliliters of milk per animal taken from each of the four teats. That's very important, the USDA noted, because there have been reports of infected animals having virus in only one teat. A strange feature of H5N1's jump from birds into cows is that the virus seems to have developed an affinity for mammary tissue. Samples from sick cows show the highest levels of virus not in their noses but in their milk, suggesting that udders seem to be where H5N1 migrates to or infects. Trending Now: Early tests of H5N1 prevalence in milk suggest U.S. bird flu outbreak in cows is widespread The USDA order does not apply to beef cattle or non-lactating dairy cattle, including calves, due to their lower risk profile, according to the guidance. But influenza researchers told STAT that not enough yet is known about the risks to non-lactating animals to leave them out. 'Testing such cattle destined to move between states would not only guard against interstate spread of the virus, it would give important insight into the susceptibility of non-lactating animals,' Lowen said. Thijs Kiuken, a professor of comparative pathology in the Department of Viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, is particularly concerned about the potential for milk from infected cows to harm calves. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has encouraged farmers to discard milk from H5N1-positive cows, but if that's not possible and farmers intend to feed calves with that milk, they should first heat it to kill any viruses and bacteria. Newborn calves need to consume colostrum, the antibody-rich milk cows produce in the first few days after birth, in order to start building their immune systems to ward off all the microbial threats that exist on a farm. Without it, calves often quickly succumb to infection. If a farmer doesn't know that a cow has H5N1 because it's not showing symptoms, calves could inadvertently be consuming the virus. The reason that has Kiuken worried is because of a cluster of fatal H5N1 cases in baby goats, reported in Minnesota in March. Genomic analyses showed they likely contracted the virus from a backyard poultry flock that had been depopulated due to H5N1 days before the goats were born. The animals had shared the same enclosure, including a water source that was likely contaminated. According to a report the USDA made to the World Organisation for Animal Health, five goats died from multi-organ disease, including neurological symptoms, and the virus was later found in some of the animals' brains. 'Because we don't know the extent of this virus in dairy herds in North America,' Kiuken said, 'I would expect there will be neurologically affected calves turning up sometime. My prediction is that if it has not already happened, that young dairy calves on affected farms will be found with severe highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 infection.'

{"id": "488", "title": "Fractured U.S. bird flu response has echoes of early covid", "date": "2024-04-26", "fulltext": "Federal agencies with competing interests are slowing the country's ability to track and control an outbreak of highly virulent bird flu that for the first time is infecting cows in the United States, according to government officials and health and industry experts. The response has echoes of the early days of 2020, when the coronavirus began its deadly march around the world. Today, some officials and experts express frustration that more livestock herds aren't being tested for avian flu, and that when tests and epidemiological studies are conducted, results aren't shared fast enough or with enough detail. They fear that the delays could allow the pathogen to move unchecked - and potentially acquire the genetic machinery needed to spread swiftly among people. One dairy worker in Texas has already fallen ill amid the outbreak, the second U.S. case ever of this type of bird flu. Officials and experts said the lack of clear and timely updates by some federal agencies responding to the outbreak recall similar communication missteps at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. They point, in particular, to a failure to provide more details publicly about how the H5N1 virus is spreading in cows and about the safety of the milk supply. 'This requires multiple agencies to coordinate and communicate internally, but most importantly externally, which doesn't seem to be happening due to different cultures, priorities, legal responsibilities, scientific expertise, and agility,' said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who writes a weekly infectious-diseases newsletter and has closely tracked the avian flu outbreak. 'Mix that in with the usual challenges of scientific uncertainty, complexity and, quite frankly global pressure, and you got yourself an utterly, unacceptable mess.' A senior administration official said there have been 'no competing interests.' The White House's Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy is coordinating the outbreak response with relevant agencies 'that are working quickly and methodically.' The government is 'committed to sharing results as soon as possible,' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 'This work is an urgent priority as we work to ensure the continued effectiveness of the federal-state milk safety system and reinforce [the Food and Drug Administration's] current assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,' the administration official said. Until Wednesday, testing for H5N1 in dairy herds was voluntary and limited to cows with certain symptoms. The number of tests per farm was limited, too. That protocol provoked sharp criticism from public health experts. With growing evidence that the virus is more widespread than feared among cows, the U.S. Agriculture Department announced Wednesday that lactating dairy cows must be tested for bird flu before moving across state lines, starting Monday. Responsibility for monitoring and containing the outbreak is divided among three agencies. USDA leads the investigation into the virus in cows, the FDA oversees food safety, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is monitoring risks to people. Agencies have given individual updates on their parts of the outbreak investigation, but Wednesday marked the first time since bird flu was detected in cows four weeks ago that CDC, FDA and USDA, along with other agencies, held a news briefing jointly. On Thursday, government scientists shared detailed data at a webinar hosted by the Association of State and Territorial State Health Officials. For weeks, key federal agencies have expressed confidence in the safety of the commercial milk supply, including pasteurized products sold at grocery stores. But it was two weeks before the FDA responded directly to The Washington Post's questions about whether the agency was testing milk on grocery store shelves for H5N1. On Tuesday, the agency confirmed that viral particles had been found 'in some of the samples,' but it declined to provide details. On Wednesday, an FDA official confirmed fragments were found in milk on shelves but declined to say how many samples the agency has tested, how many had virus fragments and where the milk originated. The testing does not indicate whether genetic traces of the virus are active or dead. During the Thursday webinar, Donald A. Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said early results showed 1 of 5 samples had viral fragments, 'maybe with some preponderance for areas with known [infected dairy] herds.' He did not say how many samples were tested, or from what parts of the country. Additional tests must be done to check whether the virus is infectious. Even with these results, the agency has seen nothing to change its assessment that the commercial milk supply remains safe, Prater said. Officials are seeking answers to other key questions: They want to know whether the virus is spreading among cows through mechanical means, such as milking equipment, as evidence suggests, or through the air, which would be more dangerous and lead to more sustained spread. They are also interested in knowing how long livestock will shed virus in their milk once they have recovered from an infection. And, crucially, they will seek to ascertain the risks for human exposure and whether protocols are in place at the state level if additional people test positive. The investigation 'involves different types of samples, different types of studies and really being methodical about how we're approaching answers to those questions around things like ensuring safety of the food supply,' said one senior government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal policy discussions. 'We're not trying to pull the fire alarm here and suggest that there's more of a risk to people than exists,' said another federal health official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. The key to the outbreak resides with the cows. Public health officials and industry experts say the USDA should be doing broader testing to paint a clearer picture of the scale of the outbreak. The government has been too slow in sharing genetic information and epidemiological studies, they said. More routine testing on herds and even other animals would reduce the risk of spreading the virus to other cattle and poultry farms, public health experts and veterinarians have said. 'Given this is a novel outbreak, testing needs to be done widely and rapidly, investigators need to be on affected farms, and scientists and policymakers need to be bringing it all together to set a coordinated plan of action,' Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said in an email last week. Inglesby was the White House testing czar during the Biden administration's coronavirus response. 'This isn't just about protecting U.S. agricultural interests,' said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. 'This is about protecting human health, protecting farmworkers that may be in harm's way and preventing another pandemic from happening.' Nearly three dozen livestock herds in eight states have been infected in the last month. The virus has also spread from dairy farms to poultry farms and infected barn cats. Epidemiologists fear that indicates cows can pass the virus to birds, and possibly other animals, broadening the potential for spread. Scientists who performed genetic analyses of virus taken from infected animals say the tests suggest the outbreak may have been occurring for longer and across more of the United States than previously thought. Michael Worobey, a University of Arizona virologist who led a team of scientists who analyzed 239 genetic sequences released Sunday by the USDA, said the evolutionary tree of the virus 'resoundingly indicates that this outbreak had a single origin and that it had been circulating under our noses for months before it was noticed.' 'The concerning thing was it meant that all of these outbreaks in at least eight different states traced back to a common ancestor that had been around probably since late 2023 and that meant that this outbreak almost certainly has its tendrils all across the U.S. and perhaps beyond,' Worobey said. Scientists trying to piece together the outbreak's genesis said the USDA was too slow in sharing critical genetic data initially, and when 'a big dump' of 239 genetic sequences arrived Sunday, it was not comprehensive. 'Like what samples they are coming from, when exactly they were collected and where exactly they were collected,' said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and principal research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. Public health and veterinary experts say they also want more epidemiological data - including information on the movement of animals, their feed sources and how many workers are on-site - to understand how and where the virus is circulating. Beth Thompson, South Dakota's state veterinarian and president of the National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials, said such information needs to be shared quickly. 'It's like if you just rip one page out of a chapter in a book and hand it to the states, that isn't the whole chapter,' Thompson said. 'We need all of the information to be given back to us.' The lack of more aggressive testing of livestock and transparent data-sharing has frustrated officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, according to another federal health official and a public health expert who were briefed on the response. USDA officials may be constrained by their mission to promote new markets for farmers and protect animal health and welfare, said an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 'They're just twisting themselves into knots because they've got two missions that are, in this instance, pointing in different directions,' the administration official said. The official suggested the agency is operating at a level of urgency closer to a 4 when it should be a 10, the official said. Not true, said USDA spokeswoman Marissa Perry. 'USDA's top priority is containing this emerging animal health issue,' Perry said. While H5N1 is typically fatal in poultry, the disease in infected cows has been relatively mild, and animals have recovered in a week to 10 days, according to agriculture officials. The biggest challenge so far has been identifying farms willing to share samples, said Rosemary Sifford, the USDA's chief veterinary officer. The agency has been testing sick and healthy cows in affected herds, and in recent days began testing in unaffected herds, she said in an interview last week. The virus appears to be spreading in cows that are producing milk 'and the place that those animals are most closely congregated, have the most contact, would be as they're moving through the milking parlor,' Sifford said. 'We are not seeing this virus moving outside the lactating herd.' This strain of avian flu has been circulating for more than 20 years, but its leap into cows is of significant concern, surprising even longtime observers of the virus. While avian flu has infected humans - especially in Asia - the virus has yet to prove able to spread efficiently in people. But the more the virus jumps animal to animal, the greater the chance mutations will emerge that allow sustained person-to-person transmission, the required next step for a pandemic. State health officials have tested at least 23 people; only the dairy worker in Texas, who has since recovered, was confirmed positive. Ongoing surveillance of emergency department visits and flu testing results in regions with bird flu have not identified any unusual or concerning patterns, the CDC's principal deputy director, Nirav Shah, said Wednesday. The risk to the public from bird flu remains low. For dairy farmers, the potential impact on their business is top of mind. 'Lots of farms aren't raising their hands to be tested because they don't want to be known as having an infected herd,' said Keith Poulsen, director of the veterinary diagnostic lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Jamie Jonker, chief science officer for the National Milk Producers Federation, described as appropriate the USDA announcement on testing and interstate movement. But milk producers are waiting for the USDA's detailed guidance to know how many tests may need to be performed on milk cows, estimated to number about 8 million, Jonker said. The testing mandate could help overcome reluctance from some milk producers to allow testing in their herds, the USDA's Mike Watson said Wednesday. The cost of mandatory testing would be reimbursed by the agency. A wide swath of federal agencies are mobilizing in the event the highly pathogenic virus evolves. At highest risk are farmworkers, who, like many in the agriculture sector, are undocumented or do not wish to interact with the government, Shah said. In an emergency call three weeks ago with state health and lab officials, Shah laid out a detailed list of operational questions state officials needed to answer to prepare for potential exposures in people. 'What nurse and what epidemiologist have you trained up to do this? Do you have the [nasal] swabs ready? Do they know how to approach that conversation in a culturally competent and linguistically competent manner? Is the lab ready to go?'

{"id": "489", "title": "Federal Officials Find No Live Bird Flu Virus in Initial Milk Tests", "date": "2024-04-26", "fulltext": "The early results suggest that pasteurization is killing the H5N1 virus in milk, something that regulators were not certain of. Federal regulators on Friday said that they had not yet discovered live bird flu virus in the first batch of retail milk samples they tested, a reassuring indication that the milk on store shelves remains safe despite an outbreak of the virus among dairy cows. In an online update, the Food and Drug Administration said an initial set of tests looking for live virus, not just genetic fragments, suggested that the pasteurization process was effectively neutralizing the pathogen. \"These results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the F.D.A. wrote in the update, adding that the testing efforts were ongoing. Officials also tested infant and toddler formula, which incorporate powdered dairy, and did not find the virus, the agency wrote. The F.D.A. embarked on a national survey of milk samples shortly after an outbreak of the bird flu virus, called H5N1, was discovered among dairy cows. Government scientists have been testing 297 samples of retail dairy products from 38 states, a swath of the country that covers regions far beyond the nine states known to have infected herds. The first type of testing regulators conducted, a form of polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is relatively speedy, but it picks up only genetic traces of the virus and does not tell researchers whether the live pathogen is present. On Thursday, the F.D.A. said that those tests showed that roughly one in five retail milk samples nationwide contained fragments of bird flu virus, suggesting it was spreading among cows much more widely than previously known. The samples containing genetic fragments are subsequently tested for live bird flu virus, which, if present, might represent a widespread health threat. The test for live virus, called egg inoculation, is the most sensitive of its kind, but it takes time. The process involves injecting a portion of the milk product into chicken eggs, waiting for the virus to grow in the egg and then looking for signs of an infection. Chicken eggs are efficient vessels for growing flu viruses; even scarce amounts will thrive there. For that reason, the F.D.A.'s new results strongly suggest that the tested samples did not contain infectious virus and that pasteurization is working, scientists said. The negative results reported on Friday came from a \"limited set of geographically targeted samples,\" according to the F.D.A. Officials did not specify where the samples had come from. \"The answer at this point seems pretty conclusive that pasteurized milk is safe,\" said Samuel Scarpino, a professor of the practice in health sciences at Northeastern University. \"The fact that it's coming back negative is really strong evidence that, at least in the samples they tested, there's no live virus.\" Raw milk is never safe to drink, experts say, and it poses additional risks amid the bird flu outbreak in cattle. Almost all milk produced on U.S. farms is pasteurized, a process that kills pathogens with heat. Flu viruses are known to be fragile and sensitive to heat. Scientists stressed that the federal government would need to test more milk samples and keep testing them as the outbreak continues. Some faulted officials for not acting sooner. \"The F.D.A. should have run these tests six weeks ago, when we first heard about it,\" Dr. Scarpino said, referring to the outbreak among cattle. Dr. Scarpino also urged the government to conduct egg inoculation experiments with milk containing varying concentrations of viral genetic material. Those tests, he said, could offer reassurance that even pasteurized milk containing copious amounts of genetic fragments remained safe to drink. In addition to pasteurization, other existing safety procedures require that the milk of obviously symptomatic cows be kept from the commercial supply. While more studies are needed, Dr. Scarpino said, \"You start to layer these things on top of each other, and it becomes vanishingly unlikely there's actually going to be a problem.\" Andrew Bowman, a veterinary epidemiologist at Ohio State University who has been studying 150 retail milk samples he gathered around the Midwest, said that the F.D.A. findings mirrored the results from ongoing tests he was conducting for live virus.

{"id": "490", "title": "As bird flu spreads in cows, here are 4 big questions scientists are trying to answer", "date": "2024-04-27", "fulltext": "On Friday, Colorado became the latest state to detect the bird flu virus spreading in dairy cattle. It follows revelations earlier in the week that viral fragments are turning up in retail milk. Still, scientists don't view this as an immediate threat to human health. Genetic material is not the same as infectious virus and pasteurization is expected to inactivate the virus in milk, but the findings speak to the broader uncertainty about the extent of the spread. \"There's so many critical things that we still need to know to get a better perspective on how bad this is, or maybe it's not so bad,\" says Dr. Rick Bright, a virologist and the former head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Federal health agencies started sharing more details publicly this week, but Bright says there's still not enough transparency. \"It's the void that just leaves everyone nervous,\" he says. Other scientists say the reality is that there are still many unresolved questions about this outbreak, given how novel it is. \"There's a couple big unknowns at this point,\" says Louise Moncla, a virologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. Here's what scientists who are tracking the virus still want to know: How widespread is the virus in dairy cattle? That's still far from clear. While the official tally shows it's been detected in nine states and just over 30 herds, the actual number could be much larger. First of all, there hasn't been widespread testing in cattle. The fact that viral material is now being found in retail milk suggests \"this virus is probably spread around quite a bit,\" says Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee. On Thursday, the FDA said that preliminary results from nationwide samples of retail milk indicate about one in five samples are positive for viral traces. A survey of retail milk in the Midwest found 58 out of 150 samples were positive, according to Andrew Bowman at the Ohio State University. Webby discovered this himself when he went to the store to grab a carton of milk, which he intended to use as a negative control in his work on H5N1. To his surprise, even that ended up being positive (unfazed, he kept the milk). Currently the virus has only been detected in a tiny fraction of dairy herds in the U.S., but it's hard to know the significance of that finding when you don't also have details on the overall number of cattle tested, says Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Centers for Health Security. \"Those are kind of basic questions that would really help get us more ground truth quickly,\" he says. The USDA has just taken some new steps that could offer a better picture of the outbreak. There will be mandatory reporting of positive tests in cattle and a requirement that dairy cattle test negative for the virus before they move across state lines. Potentially complicating the picture: Some unknown number of cattle could be shedding the virus without showing obvious symptoms. Federal health officials have confirmed this. \"We don't know how many animals have this,\" says Alexis Thompson, a veterinarian at Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. \"There has been very little sampling done. We don't know how many [sick] animals we have. We don't know how many asymptomatic animals we have. That testing has not been done.\" Because milk from sick cows is supposed to be discarded, this could help explain how remnants of the virus entered the milk supply. If it turns out there are lots of animals shedding the virus and not symptomatic, the outbreak could be \"substantially larger\" than we realize, says Inglesby. \"To get to the bottom of that, we would need to do surveillance testing in places that don't already have clear outbreaks.\" Does the milk testing positive on retail shelves contain infectious virus? So far, it doesn't appear that way, but scientists who are studying this possibility acknowledge it's too soon to say that with absolute certainty. The PCR testing that has found evidence of viral fragments in the milk on grocery store shelves doesn't actually tell you whether or not it's \"live\" virus, meaning whether it's capable of replicating. This form of testing is extraordinarily sensitive and detects small pieces of genetic material, says Lee-Ann Jaykus, a food microbiologist at North Carolina State University. \"There's evidence that that milk at one point in time may have had virus associated with it, but there is no evidence that that virus would be infectious, at least with the information we currently have,\" she says. Pasteurizing milk can knock out bacteria and viruses; however, it doesn't erase every trace of those germs. Federal health officials have stressed that avian influenza doesn't stand up well to the high temperatures and past research on pasteurization indicates \"it's very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses like H5N1 in milk from cows.\" \"We've seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" said Don Prater from the Food and Drug Administration. Research on pasteurization in eggs, which happens at a lower temperature than milk, shows that the process inactivates the bird flu virus. Jaykus and other scientists agree that finding viral material doesn't necessarily suggest an immediate threat to human health. \"It's really important to sort of not get out of control about fear of consuming milk,\" says Jaykus. There is an important caveat though: There has been no direct research on how pasteurizing cow milk affects bird flu virus. Those studies are taking place right now. Early experiments on a small number of samples suggest there is no viable virus in these positive samples, said Jeanne Marrazzo, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Webby, who looked at samples of milk sent by Bowman, says they tried to grow the virus in cultured cells and embryonated chicken eggs — two places where flu loves to grow — and found that it did not reproduce. \"It's pretty good evidence,\" he says, \"We could never say there's none, but we could say if it's there, it's at a very, very, very low level.\" Jaykus says even if the milk did happen to have a small amount of infectious virus, \"there just isn't evidence that that is a transmission route for flu.\" Rick Bright, on the other hand, has more concerns about the milk. \"It's a small inconvenience for me not to drink milk until we have more data,\" he says, \"It doesn't mean that I think everyone should stop drinking milk. It's a personal risk assessment.\" He says the key question is how much virus is in the milk, and whether that changes if more cows get sick and more virus enters the milk supply. \"The higher the viral load in the milk, the more difficult it is for pasteurization to work completely,\" he says. \"If they show at this point there's no viable virus in the milk, that's a point in time. And what's going to be really critical is that the FDA continues to monitor this.\" How exactly is the virus spreading? For weeks, the leading theory has been that the primary route of spread is through the milk. This is where high concentrations of the virus are being found. This general idea was affirmed again this week by Mike Watson with the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, who said the evidence still points to some form of \"mechanical transmission.\" Virus could be spread on \"milking equipment,\" by \"individuals moving from facility to facility,\" and via rodents that come in contact with milk and then move around, he said. Federal health officials and scientists believe the virus has moved with lactating cattle from one herd to another. But how it's getting from one cow to another on a given farm \"is a key missing piece of knowledge,\" says Webby. Genetic sequencing indicates that there was likely a single introduction from birds into cattle, which then resulted in further spread among cattle, says Moncla, who has been analyzing the genomic data. \"A lot of these cattle sequences are quite similar to each other, suggesting that there's almost certainly some degree of cattle-to-cattle transmission going on,\" she says. Moncla says it's hard to say exactly how long the virus has been spreading through dairy cattle, although some scientists have suggested it may have been circulating for many months, even earlier than February. The USDA has also noted another concerning development — that there have been some instances of the virus moving from domesticated poultry to cattle. \"The degree of transmission, combined with the fact that we're likely missing cases in cattle, leads to a bit of concern,\" says Moncla. What is the risk to humans as the virus keeps spreading? First the reassuring news: Even with all these cows being infected, there has only been one documented human infection during the current outbreak in dairy cattle. That person, a dairy worker in Texas, had conjunctivitis. This week, federal health officials reiterated that the overall risk to the general public remains low, in part because \"we have not observed changes to the virus's genetic makeup that would suggest an enhanced ability to spread to humans or among humans,\" said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the CDC. So far, states have tested 23 people for avian flu and have monitored 44 people who were considered exposed and at risk for infection, he said. Generally, cases of bird flu are rare in humans and it takes a big dose of virus — for example through direct contact while slaughtering poultry — to get infected. Since 2022, there have been 26 human cases of H5N1 virus infection reported worldwide. Webby says it is possible that cows don't put that much \"pressure on the virus to change,\" which could be one reason scientists haven't seen alarming mutations in the samples collected. \"I don't think the needle has moved at all\" in terms of human risk, he says. Of course, the perennial fear is that the virus could mutate while in cows, or an intermediary animal, and then find its way into humans. Scientists have documented some mutations in bird flu when it has spread in other mammals. But previous research has shown there needs to be a host of changes — most of all, the virus would have to evolve a way to bind to receptors in the upper airway of humans — to become a pandemic threat. When it comes to cattle, the CDC's Sonja Olsen says they still aren't sure if it's the exposure to raw milk on the farms that's the primary risk to humans. \"We don't know if it's [surface] transmission. We don't know if there's aerosolization of the milk.\" Dr. Bright says the CDC should be conducting antibody studies on dairy workers to see if human cases have escaped detection, rather than waiting for cases to show up in the emergency room. \"I am going to keep my radar up,\" he says. \"If this were to get out of hand, we have to be prepared to respond really quickly. And I'm not quite sure we're fully ready to respond if we needed to.\" Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit NPR. Copyright © 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

{"id": "491", "title": "Bird flu virus has been spreading in US cows for months, RNA reveals", "date": "2024-04-27", "fulltext": "Genomic analysis suggests that the outbreak probably began in December or January, but a shortage of data is hampering efforts to pin down the source. A strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza has been silently spreading in US cattle for months, according to preliminary analysis of genomic data. The outbreak is likely to have begun when the virus jumped from an infected bird into a cow, probably around late December or early January. This implies a protracted, undetected spread of the virus, suggesting that more cattle across the United States, and even in neighbouring regions, could have been infected with avian influenza than currently reported. These conclusions are based on swift and summary analyses by researchers, following a dump of genomic data by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) into a public repository earlier this week. But to scientists' dismay, the publicly released data do not include critical information that would shed light on the outbreak's origins and evolution. Researchers also express concern that the genomic data wasn't released until almost four weeks after the outbreak was announced. Speed is especially important for fast-spreading respiratory pathogens that have the potential to spark pandemics, says Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatician at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. The cattle outbreak is not expected to allow the virus to gain the ability to spread between people, but researchers say it is important to be vigilant. 'In an outbreak response, the faster you get data, the sooner you can act,' says Martha Nelson, a genomic epidemiologist at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in Bethesda, Maryland. Nelson adds that with every week that goes by, the window for controlling the outbreak narrows. 'Whether we're not too late, to me, that's kind of the million dollar question.' Single spillover Federal officials announced on 25 March that a highly pathogenic bird-flu strain had been detected in dairy cows. The USDA has since confirmed infections with the strain, named H5N1, in 34 dairy herds in nine states. In late March and early April, the USDA posted a handful of viral sequences from cows sampled in Texas and a sequence from a human case, on the widely used repository GISAID. On 21 April, the USDA posted more sequencing data on the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), a repository maintained by the NCBI. The latest upload included some 10 gigabytes of sequencing information from 239 animals, including cows, chickens and cats, says Karthik Gangavarapu, a computational biologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, who processed the raw data. How countries are using genomics to help avoid a second coronavirus wave Analysis of the genomes suggests that the cattle outbreak probably began with a single introduction from wild birds in December or early January. 'It's good news that there's only been one jump that we can discern so far. But bad news, in many ways that it has been spreading for probably several months already,' says Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, who has analysed the genomes. 'This virus is clearly transmitting among cows in some way,' says Louise Moncla, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, who has studied the genomic data. Nelson, who is analysing the data, says she was most surprised by the extent of the genetic diversity in the virus infecting cattle, which indicates that the virus has had months to evolve. Among the mutations are changes to a viral-protein section that scientists have linked to possible adaptation to spread in mammals, she says. The data also show occasional jumps back from infected cows to birds and cats. 'This is a multi-host outbreak,' says Nelson. A single jump, many months ago, is 'the most reliable conclusion you can make,' based on the available data, says Eric Bortz, a virologist at the University of Alaska Anchorage. But an important caveat is that it isn't clear what percentage of infected cows the samples represent, he says. Fill in the blank That's only one of many data gaps. Scientists lack information about each sample's precise collection date and the state where it was collected. Such gaps are 'very abnormal,' Nelson says. The missing 'metadata' make it harder to answer many open questions, such as how the virus is transmitted between cows and herds, and make it tricky to pin down exactly when the virus jumped to cows. These insights could help to control further viral spread, and protect workers on cattle farms 'who can least afford to be exposed,' says Worobey. Worobey, Gangavarapu and their colleagues are now racing to analyse some metadata uncovered through online sleuthing by Florence Débarre, an evolutionary biologist at the French national research agency CNRS in Paris. Gangavarapu says dates and geographic information for 152 of the 239 samples have been extracted from a USDA presentation posted on YouTube on 26 April. Real-time flu tracking Researchers also want more swabbing of cattle and wild birds to gain more insights into the outbreak's exact origin and to decipher another puzzle. The genomic data reveal that the viral genome sequenced from the infected person does not include some of the signature mutations observed in the cattle. 'That is a mystery to everyone,' says Nelson. One possibility is that the person was infected by a separate viral lineage, which infected cattle that have not been swabbed. Another less likely scenario, which can't be ruled out, says Nelson, is that the person was infected directly from a wild bird. 'It raises just a whole slew of questions about what black box of samples we are missing.' Shilo Weir, a public affairs specialist at the USDA, says the agency decided to post the unanalysed sequence data on the SRA to make it public as soon as possible.

{"id": "492", "title": "USDA says it is testing beef for H5N1 bird flu virus", "date": "2024-04-29", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Food safety officials say they are testing beef, including ground beef from grocery stores, for the presence of the H5N1 bird flu virus that's spreading in dairy cattle. The United States Department of Agriculture said on Monday that it is conducting three separate beef safety studies. The agency is sampling ground beef purchased at grocery stores in states where dairy cattle have tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus. It is also taking samples of muscle tissue from sick cows that have been culled from their herd. Finally, they're conducting cooking studies, which will inoculate ground beef with a 'virus surrogate' and cook it to different temperatures to see how much virus is killed under each heat setting. The move comes as one country, Colombia, placed restrictions on beef and beef products coming from US states where dairy herds have tested positive for avian influenza. The US Beef Export Foundation said the restrictions 'have no scientific basis.' The US is the largest supplier of beef to Colombia, accounting for about $40 million last year, the foundation said. The USDA is testing beef with polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, testing, a highly sensitive lab test that can pick up even traces of inert genetic material from the virus, if any is present. Any positive samples will be further evaluated for live virus, USDA said. 'USDA is confident that the meat supply is safe. USDA has a rigorous meat inspection process' and 'multiple safeguards in place to protect consumers,' the agency said in a statement sent to media outlets on Monday. 'We recommend consumers properly handle raw meats and cook to a safe internal temperature,' which kills bacteria and viruses in meat, the agency added.", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_count": 0, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "USDA is confident that the meat supply is safe.

{"id": "493", "title": "There� never a good time to drink raw milk. But now� a really bad time as bird flu infects cows", "date": "2024-04-29", "fulltext": "Scientists who know about the types of pathogens — E. coli and Salmonella among them — that can be transmitted in raw milk generally think drinking unpasteurized milk is a bad idea. But right now, they believe, the danger associated with raw milk may have gone to a whole new level. “If I were in charge, for the moment I would forbid the selling of raw milk,” said Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, who has done research on H5N1 and the damage it inflicts for about two decades. H5N1 bird flu has been circulating in dairy cow herds in multiple parts of the country, likely for months now. Testing of milk from infected cows shows the virus is present in concentrations that have taken scientists by surprise. They worry that if a raw-milk consumer inadvertently drank milk from infected cows, the results could be bad — potentially really bad. “I absolutely wouldn’t go anywhere near raw milk in terms of consuming it,” said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., whose laboratories have been involved in testing to see if evidence of H5N1 RNA can be found in commercially purchased milk — it can — and whether live virus can be grown from pasteurized milk containing H5N1 RNA. So far it looks like the answer to that question is no. FURTHER READING Deeper look: H5N1 bird flu Genetic analysis suggests the H5N1 flu virus outbreak in cows likely started earlier than originally thought. Video explainer: Traces of the avian flu virus have been found in grocery store milk. Here's what we know about pasteurization, the H5N1 virus, and consumer safety. In a widespread bird flu pandemic, could the world produce enough H5N1 vaccine to protect the entire population? A look at lessons in preparedness from Covid-19. STAT First Opinion essay: Humans have no natural immunity to the H5N1 virus. The discovery of avian flu in U.S. cattle is a wake-up call to action. While the Food and Drug Administration bans the interstate sale and distribution of raw milk, rules surrounding its use in an individual state are set by the state legislature. Some ban the sale of raw milk for human consumption; others allow it under a variety of circumstances. (A state-by-state rundown is here.) Kuiken said his concern about the risk that infected raw milk poses is not so much that the practice might somehow help the virus to mutate in ways that would allow it to spread easily to and among people — in other words, trigger a pandemic. But he believes it would likely seriously sicken people who drink raw milk from an H5N1-infected cow. Reports of the amount of virus present in infected udders is higher than anything he’s seen in studies where he’s experimentally infected animals with H5N1 to chart the illness the virus wreaked, Kuiken said. Jürgen Richt, a veterinarian and director of the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases at Kansas State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, spoke with a note of disbelief in his voice about the amount of dead viruses or viral particles being found in commercial milk that tested positive for the virus. “From [results] I have seen, I wouldn’t want to drink raw milk,” Richt said. “And I wouldn’t feed it to my cats, nor my dogs, nor my calves, if I’m on a farm.” The FDA is urging consumers not to drink raw milk or eat raw milk cheeses. That is a position the agency has long held, because of the other health risks these products hold, but it has re-emphasized it in the current context. It has also recommended the dairy industry not “manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including raw milk cheese, made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those infected with avian influenza viruses or exposed to those infected with avian influenza viruses.” Kuiken said he is less concerned about raw milk cheeses, saying the various processes involved in cheesemaking are “not conducive to survival of infectious virus.” He did suggest, though, that raw milk cheesemakers could be at risk, if they were inadvertently using milk laced with H5N1 virus. Related: Cattle testing for H5N1 bird flu will be more limited than USDA initially announced Whether herds owned by farmers who sell raw milk have been infected by the virus isn’t publicly known. While authorities and scientists believe outbreaks are occurring over a much broader swathe of the country than has been detected, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has only confirmed infections of 33 herds in nine states — Texas, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Idaho, Ohio, South Dakota, North Carolina, and Colorado. It has not given any details about the operations on which infected animals were found. But the USDA has admitted some farmers have been refusing to test their animals. And analysis of the genetic sequences of viruses retrieved from cows combined with evidence of H5N1 RNA in commercial milk found in a number of U.S. markets — the FDA said Thursday that about 1 in 5 samples tested for H5N1 from across the country have been positive — bolster the argument that this has been going on for longer than has been recognized and likely involves far more herds than have tested positive. The testing of commercial milk was done by polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. In PCR testing, the concentration of a pathogen is estimated by how many cycles the test has to run to find it. The lower the cycle threshold — known as a “Ct value” — the higher the concentration. Anything with a cycle threshold of 29 or lower is considered a strongly positive result. Some milk testing has shown a Ct value of below 10, Kuiken said. Webby, who is also the director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals (located at St. Jude), said drinking raw milk that is infected with H5N1 could deliver a whopping dose of virus to a person’s system — enough to trigger a fatal infection in lab studies where small animals are experimentally infected with H5N1. “Of course, we don’t know what a lethal dose, or even infectious dose, is in humans. But it makes absolutely no sense to me that you’d want to try,” he said. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy We think of flu viruses as pests that plague our upper and sometimes lower respiratory tracts, causing congestion, sneezing, fever, coughing, and in some cases triggering pneumonia. Because of their biology, the influenza A viruses that routinely transmit among people — H1N1 and H3N2 — are effectively limited to infecting the cells in the respiratory tract, said Florian Krammer, an influenza virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. But H5N1 has more tricks up its sleeve than seasonal flu viruses do; it can infect organs other than the lungs. Kuiken noted that the virus has been seen to move into the liver, the central nervous system and the brain, among other tissues. He saw the latter when he experimentally infected cats in the mid-2000s. Similar results were seen when baby goats were infected with the virus on a Minnesota farm in March. Ten of the kids died; necropsies on five of them showed virus in the brains and other organs. Many of the animal species infected in the wild have been reported to sustain damage outside of the respiratory tract. It’s believed these animals — bears, raccoons, seals, foxes, and a raft of other mammals — became infected by eating sick or dead wild birds or poultry infected with the virus. “So many, many species, they get a brain infection and brain disease, not a pulmonary disease,” Kuiken said. “In some cases the disease is missed because people are expecting pneumonia. If the animal is found dead, they don’t see the neurologic signs, and they forget to test the brain.” Human infection with flu occurs when people breathe viruses emitted by others into their upper respiratory tracts. But the shared real estate of the top of the respiratory and gastric tracts make it impossible to rule out the possibility that ingestion of food or drink that contained high levels of viable H5N1 virus could trigger infection, scientists said. Krammer said there are several mechanisms that could come into play. “You could get infection of cells in the upper respiratory tract that could go down and cause lower respiratory tract infection. There could be a route where it’s really going to the olfactory bulb,” he said, going from there to the brain. “And there’s the other option that it really makes it through the stomach … and then you start an infection from the mid gut.” Krammer said he thought that last option was unlikely; he thinks stomach acids would inactivate the virus. But Kuiken doesn’t believe that’s necessarily true, referring to his study of H5N1 in cats. Milk acts as a buffer, he said. “It’s the perfect fluid for [virus] reaching the intestine in an infectious state.” Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the WHO’s department of epidemic and pandemic preparedness, pointed to another outbreak, involving another virus and another animal species — the MERS coronavirus, which spreads to people from camels — as an example of where ingestion of virus-laced milk may have triggered infection of a respiratory disease. Some cases of MERS were traced to the drinking of raw camel’s milk, Van Kerkhove said, though she noted it wasn’t generally possible to tease out whether it was the drinking of the milk or the act of milking that led to the infections. (Influenza viruses and coronaviruses belong to different families.) She acknowledged that some people take comfort from the notion that stomach acids would kill H5N1, but said it is important to look for evidence-based answers. The experts STAT spoke to for this story said it would also be prudent for public health authorities looking for possible human cases of H5N1 to cast their net broadly, given that ingestion of the virus might trigger symptoms not typically associated with influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it is monitoring emergency room data for unusual cases of flu and for conjunctivitis. (There has only been one confirmed case associated with the dairy cow outbreaks to date, a farm worker in Texas who had conjunctivitis.) “I think that’s why it’s also important to look out for all kinds of weird syndromes that might come up in the areas where there is more exposure and people have more exposure to dairy cattle,” Krammer said. “It could be neurological. It could be basically conjunctivitis. It could be more traditional respiratory infections. But also, something new could come up.” “In a way, we think we know H5, but the cow trick was completely new and we don’t know what the virus would do when it goes into humans. Maybe it does something very unexpected. There’s just not enough data to say anything conclusive. So I think people should just be watchful,” he said. Richt agreed. “Expect the unexpected.

{"id": "494", "title": "Bird flu explained: How it spreads, milk and egg safety and more", "date": "2024-04-29", "fulltext": "After a dairy worker in Texas was infected with a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, disease trackers worry the recent outbreak among cattle could develop into a larger threat. Federal officials are now requiring lactating dairy cows to test negative for the virus before moving across state lines. The risk to the general public remains low, but experts are concerned about the possibility of the H5N1 virus evolving and more easily spreading from birds to other mammals. Here's what to know about bird flu, its symptoms and treatment, and its risk to humans and pets. What is bird flu? Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, birds of prey and waterfowl, but also domestic birds such as poultry. In the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in more than 9,000 wild birds and has affected more than 82 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks since early 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, avian influenza viruses can survive for long periods in cold temperatures on surfaces such as farm equipment, which allows them to spread from farm to farm. Can humans catch bird flu? It is rare, but humans can become infected with bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds—whether the birds are dead or alive—or with surfaces that may have been contaminated by an infected bird's saliva or feces. Although the virus has been detected in wild mammals such as red foxes, raccoons, opossums and skunks—probably from eating infected wild birds—experts said the virus poses a low risk to humans. Two human cases have been reported in the United States, including the case in Texas, which the CDC announced Monday. The first case was in 2022, when a person in Colorado with direct exposure to poultry tested positive for the same strain. Infections could range from mild cases such as conjunctivitis—an eye infection that could occur after handling contaminated material and then touching the eyes—to more serious but rare respiratory infections, experts said. The virus typically doesn't infect the human respiratory tract, because humans don't have the receptors in their throats, noses or upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current bird flu strain. A person would need to breathe in a large amount of the virus—by sweeping up and inhaling infected fecal matter deep into the lungs, for example—to develop a respiratory infection from the virus, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. \"In those circumstances, the virus can initiate an infection in an occasional human and quickly develop into influenza pneumonia,\" he said, and then \"the fatality rate is very high.\" Is it safe to drink milk and eat cheese and yogurt? Federal agencies are reassuring the public about the nation's dairy supply after the bird flu was recently found in dairy cows and viral fragments were discovered in milk sold at grocery stores. Experts say the mere presence of viral particles is not surprising and does not mean people can get infected by consuming products containing them. Since milk products are pasteurized, \"there continues to be no concern about the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,\" the Food and Drug Administration said in a notice on its website. That applies to other dairy products, including cheese, yogurt and ice cream, but officials are doing additional studies to see if there are any differences with other milk products containing viral fragments. Only milk from healthy animals is authorized to be distributed into interstate commerce for humans to consume, the agency said, adding that \"pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza.\" That means there hasn't been much impact on the country's supply of milk or the cost of dairy products. Can you get bird flu from eating chicken or eggs? No. Humans cannot become infected by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs. However, according to the CDC, \"uncooked poultry and poultry products (like blood) could have been the source of a small number of bird flu virus infections in people in Southeast Asia.\" The CDC advises that \"it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States.\" Still, on commercial farms, Cardona said infected poultry—and other chickens or turkeys that are exposed to those infected poultry—are typically killed to protect the U.S. food supply. \"It's good to know that they don't make it into any food products,\" she said. \"They don't even make it into your pet food.\" What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans? Some people who are infected may not experience symptoms, according to the CDC. Others may have mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis or flu-like symptoms—fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, fatigue and, in more serious cases involving pneumonia, trouble breathing. The symptoms of bird flu depend on the strain of the virus with which each person becomes infected. The strains that have caused most of the human infections in the past 25 years are H5N1 and H7N9, the CDC said. Bird flu infection is diagnosed in a lab, usually by swabbing someone's nose and throat. How is it treated? People who contract bird flu are typically treated with supportive care and, in serious cases, with ventilators to help them breathe. There are also antiviral medications that are effective at treating the current strains, Schaffner said. Is there a bird flu vaccine for humans? Yes, there are vaccines for the bird flu. But they would need to be tested to determine whether they are a match for this specific strain. Vaccine manufacturing would then need to be scaled up and mass-produced. Can bird flu kill humans? Yes, it can be fatal, mainly when the virus gets into the lungs and causes influenza pneumonia, but that is rare. According to the World Health Organization, between January 2003 and February 2024, 887 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 were reported globally from 23 countries. Of those who were infected, there were 462 deaths. While these numbers might seem scary, experts caution that the risk to the general public is low and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Could bird flu become the next pandemic? Each time there is a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, it triggers concerns that the virus could mutate to infect humans more readily and start spreading from person to person. That happened with swine flu in 2009, when pigs became simultaneously infected with avian influenza and human influenza. The two viruses exchanged their genetic material inside the pigs, allowing the bird flu to use the genetic blueprint from the human flu to spread among people. Such a pandemic cannot be predicted because this exchange of genetic material is a random event. \"If anything, the odds are against it,\" Schaffner said, noting that bird flu strains are circulating all the time and do not pose a risk to humans. Although the strain has infected some mammals—including mink, causing an outbreak at a Spanish farm in October 2022—that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to pick up the capacity to spread to humans,\" he said. Can dogs and cats catch bird flu? Dogs have contracted avian influenza strains in the past, said Carol Cardona, chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota. But because the family dog or cat is not typically in contact with infected birds like wild animals are, their risk is low, she said. Still, experts warned against letting dogs or cats eat dead birds for a variety of health reasons. \"If you are keeping your cat indoors and you're keeping your dog on a leash, I don't see any reason that you would be expecting to see an infection,\" Cardona said. What about my backyard chickens? People who own their chickens should be vigilant, experts said. Backyard chickens could come into contact with wild birds either directly or through their bodily secretions, putting them at risk for potential infection. Experts recommended keeping backyard chickens inside an enclosure to keep them away from any migratory birds that may be carrying the disease. Chickens that become infected may become unusually quiet, stop producing eggs or produce fewer of them and develop respiratory symptoms and diarrhea before they start dying. People who have backyard chickens should take precautions and avoid touching infected chickens or their eggs, or contaminated surfaces, experts said. Does risk vary by state or country? Some locations have been more affected than others, but there is no place that is entirely risk-free, said Munir Iqbal, head of the avian influenza virus group at the Pirbright Institute in England. \"The virus is very much endemic now in wild birds, and the wild birds are going all around the world, so therefore the threat to the poultry has become constant and unpredictable,\" Iqbal said. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was first identified in geese in Guangdong, China, in 1996. It spread widely in Asia between 2003 and 2005, mutating into different strains that have since caused periodic outbreaks around the world. Can birds be vaccinated against bird flu? China, Egypt and some other nations that experienced prior deadly outbreaks of bird flu have focused on vaccinating flocks of birds to decrease bird mortality. But vaccination for bird flu is also costly, and there is no universal agreement on whether it is an effective strategy to manage outbreaks. Britain, where systematic vaccination of domesticated birds is banned in most cases, states in its official guidelines that vaccines are too difficult to administer properly over time, have not been proven to work in all affected bird species and are complicated to develop and adapt because the virus mutates so quickly. In the United States and Europe, authorities monitor bird populations and, when they detect infections, cull flocks, including healthy birds that may have been exposed. This is costly because many governments compensate farmers when their healthy birds are killed. Should you worry birds in your area are spreading avian flu? Wild birds—such as ducks, geese and swans—are most likely to be infected with this strain of bird flu, according to the CDC. It can easily be spread to poultry, like chickens and turkey. However, the most common songbirds or other birds found in backyards—like cardinals, robins and pigeons—don't usually carry bird flu viruses dangerous to poultry or humans. Generally, people should avoid direct contact with wild birds, the CDC states. What precautions are federal and state health officials recommending? Federal and state health officials are recommending that people avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals, including cattle, as well as animal carcasses, raw milk, feces, litter or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI virus infection. An order issued by the U.S. Agriculture Department requires lactating dairy cows to be tested before moving across state lines. Those that test positive would have to wait 30 days and test negative before being moved, officials said. People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or food products, including unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheeses, from animals with confirmed or suspected bird flu. CDC is recommending that farmers and owners of poultry, backyard flock and livestock wear personal protective equipment, such as N95 masks, eye protection and gloves, as well as wash their hands thoroughly when in direct contact—or entering any buildings—with sick or dead birds or other animals, carcasses, or feces or litter of potentially infected animals.

{"id": "495", "title": "As bird flu spreads in cows, fractured U.S. response has echoes of early covid", "date": "2024-04-29", "fulltext": "Federal agencies with competing interests are slowing the country's ability to track and control an outbreak of highly virulent bird flu that for the first time is infecting cows in the United States, according to government officials and health and industry experts. The response has echoes of the early days of 2020, when the coronavirus began its deadly march around the world. Today, some officials and experts express frustration that more livestock herds aren't being tested for avian flu, and that when tests and epidemiological studies are conducted, results aren't shared fast enough or with enough detail. They fear that the delays could allow the pathogen to move unchecked and potentially acquire the genetic machinery needed to spread swiftly among people. One dairy worker in Texas has already fallen ill amid the outbreak, the second U.S. case ever of this type of bird flu. Officials and experts said the lack of clear and timely updates by some federal agencies responding to the outbreak recall similar communication missteps at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. They point, in particular, to a failure to provide more details publicly about how the H5N1 virus is spreading in cows and about the safety of the milk supply. 'This requires multiple agencies to coordinate and communicate internally, but most importantly externally, which doesn't seem to be happening due to different cultures, priorities, legal responsibilities, scientific expertise, and agility,' said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who writes a weekly infectious-diseases newsletter and has closely tracked the avian flu outbreak. 'Mix that in with the usual challenges of scientific uncertainty, complexity and, quite frankly global pressure, and you got yourself an utterly, unacceptable mess.' A senior administration official said there have been 'no competing interests.' The White House's Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy is coordinating the outbreak response with relevant agencies 'that are working quickly and methodically.' The government is 'committed to sharing results as soon as possible,' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 'This work is an urgent priority as we work to ensure the continued effectiveness of the federal-state milk safety system and reinforce [the Food and Drug Administration's] current assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,' the administration official said. Until Wednesday, testing for H5N1 in dairy herds was voluntary and limited to cows with certain symptoms. The number of tests per farm was limited, too. That protocol provoked sharp criticism from public health experts. With growing evidence that the virus is more widespread than feared among cows, the U.S. Agriculture Department announced Wednesday that lactating dairy cows must be tested for bird flu before moving across state lines, starting Monday. Responsibility for monitoring and containing the outbreak is divided among three agencies. USDA leads the investigation into the virus in cows, the FDA oversees food safety, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is monitoring risks to people. Agencies have given individual updates on their parts of the outbreak investigation, but Wednesday marked the first time since bird flu was detected in cows four weeks ago that CDC, FDA and USDA, along with other agencies, held a news briefing jointly. On Thursday, government scientists shared detailed data at a webinar hosted by the Association of State and Territorial State Health Officials. For weeks, key federal agencies have expressed confidence in the safety of the commercial milk supply, including pasteurized products sold at grocery stores. But it was two weeks before the FDA responded directly to The Washington Post's questions about whether the agency was testing milk on grocery store shelves for H5N1. On Tuesday, the agency confirmed that viral particles had been found 'in some of the samples,' but it declined to provide details. On Wednesday, an FDA official confirmed fragments were found in milk on shelves but declined to say how many samples the agency has tested, how many had virus fragments and where the milk originated. The testing does not indicate whether genetic traces of the virus are active or dead. During the Thursday webinar, Donald A. Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said early results showed 1 of 5 samples had viral fragments, 'maybe with some preponderance for areas with known [infected dairy] herds.' He did not say how many samples were tested, or from what parts of the country. Additional tests must be done to check whether the virus is infectious. Even with these results, the agency has seen nothing to change its assessment that the commercial milk supply remains safe, Prater said. Officials are seeking answers to other key questions: They want to know whether the virus is spreading among cows through mechanical means, such as milking equipment, as evidence suggests, or through the air, which would be more dangerous and lead to more sustained spread. They are also interested in knowing how long livestock will shed virus in their milk once they have recovered from an infection. And, crucially, they will seek to ascertain the risks for human exposure and whether protocols are in place at the state level if additional people test positive. The investigation 'involves different types of samples, different types of studies and really being methodical about how we're approaching answers to those questions around things like ensuring safety of the food supply,' said one senior government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal policy discussions. 'We're not trying to pull the fire alarm here and suggest that there's more of a risk to people than exists,' said another federal health official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. The key to the outbreak resides with the cows. Public health officials and industry experts say the USDA should be doing broader testing to paint a clearer picture of the scale of the outbreak. The government has been too slow in sharing genetic information and epidemiological studies, they said. More routine testing on herds and even other animals would reduce the risk of spreading the virus to other cattle and poultry farms, public health experts and veterinarians have said. 'Given this is a novel outbreak, testing needs to be done widely and rapidly, investigators need to be on affected farms, and scientists and policymakers need to be bringing it all together to set a coordinated plan of action,' Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said in an email last week. Inglesby was the White House testing czar during the Biden administration's coronavirus response. 'This isn't just about protecting U.S. agricultural interests,' said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. 'This is about protecting human health, protecting farmworkers that may be in harm's way and preventing another pandemic from happening.' Nearly three dozen livestock herds in eight states have been infected in the last month. The virus has also spread from dairy farms to poultry farms and infected barn cats. Epidemiologists fear that indicates cows can pass the virus to birds, and possibly other animals, broadening the potential for spread. Scientists who performed genetic analyses of virus taken from infected animals say the tests suggest the outbreak may have been occurring for longer and across more of the United States than previously thought. Michael Worobey, a University of Arizona virologist who led a team of scientists who analyzed 239 genetic sequences released Sunday by the USDA, said the evolutionary tree of the virus 'resoundingly indicates that this outbreak had a single origin and that it had been circulating under our noses for months before it was noticed.' 'The concerning thing was it meant that all of these outbreaks in at least eight different states traced back to a common ancestor that had been around probably since late 2023 and that meant that this outbreak almost certainly has its tendrils all across the U.S. and perhaps beyond,' Worobey said. Scientists trying to piece together the outbreak's genesis said the USDA was too slow in sharing critical genetic data initially, and when 'a big dump' of 239 genetic sequences arrived Sunday, it was not comprehensive. 'Like what samples they are coming from, when exactly they were collected and where exactly they were collected,' said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and principal research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. Public health and veterinary experts say they also want more epidemiological data including information on the movement of animals, their feed sources and how many workers are on-site to understand how and where the virus is circulating. Beth Thompson, South Dakota's state veterinarian and president of the National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials, said such information needs to be shared quickly. 'It's like if you just rip one page out of a chapter in a book and hand it to the states, that isn't the whole chapter,' Thompson said. 'We need all of the information to be given back to us.' The lack of more aggressive testing of livestock and transparent data-sharing has frustrated officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, according to another federal health official and a public health expert who were briefed on the response. USDA officials may be constrained by their mission to promote new markets for farmers and protect animal health and welfare, said an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 'They're just twisting themselves into knots because they've got two missions that are, in this instance, pointing in different directions,' the administration official said. The official suggested the agency is operating at a level of urgency closer to a 4 when it should be a 10, the official said. Not true, said USDA spokeswoman Marissa Perry. 'USDA's top priority is containing this emerging animal health issue,' Perry said. While H5N1 is typically fatal in poultry, the disease in infected cows has been relatively mild, and animals have recovered in a week to 10 days, according to agriculture officials. The biggest challenge so far has been identifying farms willing to share samples, said Rosemary Sifford, the USDA's chief veterinary officer. The agency has been testing sick and healthy cows in affected herds, and in recent days began testing in unaffected herds, she said in an interview last week. The virus appears to be spreading in cows that are producing milk 'and the place that those animals are most closely congregated, have the most contact, would be as they're moving through the milking parlor,' Sifford said. 'We are not seeing this virus moving outside the lactating herd.' This strain of avian flu has been circulating for more than 20 years, but its leap into cows is of significant concern, surprising even longtime observers of the virus. While avian flu has infected humans especially in Asia the virus has yet to prove able to spread efficiently in people. But the more the virus jumps animal to animal, the greater the chance mutations will emerge that allow sustained person-to-person transmission, the required next step for a pandemic. State health officials have tested at least 23 people; only the dairy worker in Texas, who has since recovered, was confirmed positive. Ongoing surveillance of emergency department visits and flu testing results in regions with bird flu have not identified any unusual or concerning patterns, the CDC's principal deputy director, Nirav Shah, said Wednesday. The risk to the public from bird flu remains low. For dairy farmers, the potential impact on their business is top of mind. 'Lots of farms aren't raising their hands to be tested because they don't want to be known as having an infected herd,' said Keith Poulsen, director of the veterinary diagnostic lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Jamie Jonker, chief science officer for the National Milk Producers Federation, described as appropriate the USDA announcement on testing and interstate movement. But milk producers are waiting for the USDA's detailed guidance to know how many tests may need to be performed on milk cows, estimated to number about 8 million, Jonker said. The testing mandate could help overcome reluctance from some milk producers to allow testing in their herds, the USDA's Mike Watson said Wednesday. The cost of mandatory testing would be reimbursed by the agency. A wide swath of federal agencies are mobilizing in the event the highly pathogenic virus evolves. At highest risk are farmworkers, who, like many in the agriculture sector, are undocumented or do not wish to interact with the government, Shah said. In an emergency call three weeks ago with state health and lab officials, Shah laid out a detailed list of operational questions state officials needed to answer to prepare for potential exposures in people. 'What nurse and what epidemiologist have you trained up to do this? Do you have the [nasal] swabs ready?

{"id": "496", "title": "U.S. requires more dairy cows to be tested for bird flu as concerns grow", "date": "2024-04-29", "fulltext": "Dairy cows must be tested for bird flu before moving across state lines, under a federal order issued Wednesday, as evidence mounts that the virus is more widespread than feared among cows in the United States. Biden administration officials said the move is meant to contain transmission of the virus known as H5N1 and to reduce the threat to livestock, but they maintained that the risk to humans remains low. The trajectory of the outbreak has drawn public health concerns because it marks the first time bird flu has moved to cows. The virus is far more disruptive to the poultry industry, killing chickens and forcing mass culling of flocks. It generally causes mild or no sickness in cows. But greater transmission in mammals, particularly one regularly exposed to people, increases the risk that the virus could evolve to the point that it spreads more easily in humans. An order issued by the U.S. Agriculture Department that takes effect Monday requires every lactating dairy cow to be tested before moving across state lines. Cows carrying the virus would have to wait 30 days and test negative before being moved, officials said. Positive test results would trigger additional requirements for herd owners to disclose information, including the movement of animals, to aid epidemiologic investigations, and for laboratories and state veterinarians to report cases to the USDA. 'Requiring positive test reporting will help USDA better understand this disease and testing before interstate movement will limit the spread of the virus,' Mike Watson, administrator of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told reporters. 'This is an evolving situation, and we are treating it seriously and with urgency,' he said. The testing mandate could help overcome reluctance from some milk producers to allow testing in their herds, Watson said. The cost of mandatory testing would be reimbursed by the agency. Watson said federal officials are also working with state counterparts to potentially expand testing of cows when they are moved within a state. The nation has roughly 8 million lactating cows, according to estimates, though it's unclear how often they are moved across state lines. Watson did not provide an estimate for how many cows would be tested under the new order, though he described it as a 'significant number.' He said labs have enough capacity to handle the increase and turn around results within days. The National Milk Producers Federation, an industry group, called the USDA's testing order 'appropriate.' 'Dairy farmers stand ready to take a proactive approach to ensuring that we better understand the spread of the virus, do what we can to limit that spread, and ensure the health of our animals and workers,' Gregg Doud, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement. Voluntary testing protocols for cows, limited until now to those with symptoms, has drawn criticism from public health experts. They say the true toll of the virus is probably larger than official tallies confirming avian flu in dairy cows in eight states, as well as one human case in a Texas farmworker. That person has recovered. 'We are only really starting to understand the extent of it now,' said Angela Rasmussen, principal research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. 'The testing requirements are very warranted because certainly there are economic incentives for producers to not test.' Testing uncovered fragments of the virus in milk sold at grocery stores, another sign that the virus is more prevalent in cows than official tallies show, including in asymptomatic cows. Federal officials stressed that existing research suggests pasteurization of milk and other milk products such as ice cream and cheese renders the virus unable to infect humans. Additional reviews, including the virus's presence in other dairy products such as cream, are underway, with some results expected within days or weeks. 'We have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,' said Don Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration. He also cautioned, 'We also know that assessments can change as we learn more, and we will be transparent about any changes based on emerging data.' Public health experts have also faulted the Biden administration for not sharing more data about the outbreak, warning that it could hinder scientific research and the global response. Federal officials shared more than 200 genetic sequences of the virus taken from different animals, which scientists criticized for lacking metadata that provides crucial context, such as the location and timing of the specimen collection. Scientists who analyzed the sequencing said the available information strongly suggests that the spread of H5N1 to cows stems from a single spillover event from birds in late 2023. 'The evolutionary tree resoundingly indicates that this outbreak had a single origin and that it had been circulating under our noses for months before it was noticed,' said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Arizona who led the analysis.

{"id": "497", "title": "Bird flu virus found in grocery milk as officials say supply still safe", "date": "2024-04-29", "fulltext": "Viral fragments of bird flu have been identified in samples of milk taken from grocery store shelves in the United States, a finding that does not necessarily suggest a threat to human health but indicates the avian flu virus is more widespread among dairy herds than previously thought, according to two public health officials and a public health expert who was briefed on the issue. The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it had been testing milk samples throughout the dairy production process and confirmed the detection of viral particles in some of the samples, but it declined to provide details. The presence of genetic fragments of the virus in milk is not unexpected. Pasteurization typically works to inactivate pathogens, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. It generally does not remove genetic material, Nuzzo said, but typically renders pathogens unable to cause harm to people. The greater concern, however, is that it's showing up in a lot more samples, meaning the infection is more widespread in dairy herds than we thought, said one public health official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share information not yet made public. In a four-page statement, the FDA said some of the samples collected have indicated the presence of the bird flu virus based on testing that detects viral particles but does not distinguish whether they are active or dead. The finding of virus does not mean that the sample contains an intact, infectious pathogen, the agency's statement said. Additional laboratory testing is underway to grow the virus in cells and in fertilized eggs, the latter being the gold standard for sensitive detection of active, infectious virus, the FDA said. Importantly, additional testing is required to determine whether intact pathogen is still present and if it remains infectious, which determines whether there is any risk of illness associated with consuming the product, the FDA statement said. FDA officials said results are expected in the next few days to weeks. To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe, the agency said in its statement. Officials and experts did not have additional details about the number of milk samples that were positive for particles of bird flu or where the samples originated. Although this strain of avian flu has been circulating for more than 20 years, its leap into cows is of substantial concern, surprising even longtime observers of the virus. More than two dozen livestock herds in at least eight states have been infected with avian flu since March 25, prompting investigations by federal and state officials. For weeks, key federal agencies have expressed confidence in the safety of the commercial milk supply, including pasteurized products sold at grocery stores. The FDA has highlighted data showing pasteurization inactivates other viruses and pointed to studies showing that the pasteurization process for eggs, which occurs at a lower temperature than what is used for milk, deactivates the highly pathogenic avian influenza. The International Dairy Foods Association, which represents the nation's dairy manufacturing and marketing industry, said that viral fragments are nothing more than evidence that the virus is dead. Milk and milk products produced and processed in the United States are among the safest in the world, spokesman Matt Herrick wrote in an email, adding that viral fragments are simply indicative of pasteurization doing its job effectively and protecting our commercial milk supply. In recent weeks, multiple experts expressed confidence that the pasteurization process ensures there is no threat to the safety of the nation's milk supply but said the federal government should still perform tests to confirm that is the case. Flu is a fairly wimpy virus, meaning it is fairly readily inactivated, said Richard J. Webby, a virologist at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. But that's something that has to be tested. One case of avian flu has been reported in a Texas farmworker in recent weeks, only the second human case ever of bird flu in the United States. So far, the virus has not acquired the ability to spread efficiently in people. But as it is able to jump from animal to animal, prospects increase for it mutating to cause sustained person-to-person transmission, a development that could fuel a pandemic. State health officials have tested 23 people with flu-like symptoms, but only the dairy worker in Texas has tested positive during the current outbreak. Ongoing surveillance of emergency department visits and flu tests in regions where bird flu has been detected has not flagged unusual trends in flu-like illnesses, or eye inflammation, the only symptom experienced by the dairy worker, according to officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who say the risk to the general public of bird flu remains low.

{"id": "498", "title": "First case of walrus dying from bird flu recorded in Arctic", "date": "2024-04-30", "fulltext": "Virus has already killed other mammals including sea lions and seals, while also taking toll on farm animals. The first case of a walrus dying from bird flu has been detected on one of Norway's Arctic islands, a researcher has said. The walrus was found last year on Hopen island in the Svalbard archipelago, Christian Lydersen, of the Norwegian Polar Institute, told AFP. Tests carried out by a German laboratory revealed the presence of bird flu, Lydersen said. The sample was too small to determine whether it was the H5N1 or the H5N8 strain. 'It is the first time that bird flu has been recorded in a walrus,' Lydersen said. About six dead walrus were found last year in the Svalbard islands, about 1,000km (620 miles) from the north pole and halfway between mainland Norway and the north pole. Lydersen said it was 'not improbable' that some of them had the bird flu. Frank Wong, a molecular microbiologist at the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, said transmission to walrus was of significant concern to marine mammals. Animals such as sea lions and fur seals had previously died from the disease, he said. He said bird flu was still a 'bird adapted virus' which is transmitted by birds like ducks and geese. The sporadic infection and spread of bird flu in mammals was likely due to mammals ingesting infected dead birds and living in colonies in close contact with other animals. Walrus, which can grow to a weight of two tonnes, eat mainly fish and shellfish, but sometimes also consume marine birds. Lydersen said it was important to monitor developments as walrus tend to group together in summer months when the ice flow melts. There could also be a risk from a polar bear eating an infected walrus corpse. Bird flu has taken a growing toll on farm animals since 2020. It has already killed one polar bear in Alaska, according to US authorities. Thousands of marine mammals have died from bird flu viruses in South America, according to Antarctic researchers.

Bird flu has been found in nearly three-dozen dairy herds across nine states. The new testing is the latest effort by the USDA to track and understand how the virus is spreading among livestock. Two studies will test if particles of the bird flu virus, called Type A H5N1, is found in beef for sale in the states where dairy cows have tested positive or in the muscles of dairy cows sent to slaughter. A third will test how cooking meat at different temperatures affects the virus using a bird flu surrogate. A week ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirmed it found non-infectious remnants of the bird flu virus in pasteurized milk. The particles are inactive and pose no threat to consumers, experts said. Scientists say there's no evidence to suggest people can get bird flu by consuming food that's been pasteurized or properly cooked. The virus was first found in dairy cows this spring, and since then, H5N1 was detected in the lung tissue of a dairy cow culled and sent to slaughter. So far, officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not seen signs that the virus is changing to be more transmissible to people.

{"id": "500", "title": "U.S. Needs to Better Track Bird Flu Spread in Farm Animals, Farm Workers, Epidemiologist Says", "date": "2024-04-30", "fulltext": "Avian influenza has been tearing through poultry, wild birds and even mammals without seriously affecting many people in the current outbreak. But in recent weeks, the virus has begun infecting U.S. dairy cows: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported sick animals in at least 34 herds as of April 26. And a human case involving a dairy worker in Texas has ramped up concerns that the virus, known as H5N1, could spread more widely in people. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it will test ground beef in states with outbreaks as a precaution, although the virus is thought to spread through close contact with infected animals. With COVID's rapid development into a lethal pandemic still fresh in many people's minds, it's difficult to know how worried we should be about another infectious respiratory disease gaining ground. So Scientific American spoke with Katelyn Jetelina, an independent epidemiologist who writes a popular public health newsletter, about how the outbreak has gone so far and how the U.S. could strengthen its management—which she says began as a very uncoordinated, messy response. [An edited transcript of the interview follows.] As an epidemiologist who followed COVID closely, what has it been like for you to watch the bird flu situation unfold? There's been a lot going on and pretty quickly, which I think is making us epidemiologists and virologists, as well as veterinarians, a bit nervous. H5N1 has been really heating up in the past two or three years, but what makes the past couple of months unique is that this is spreading among cows. The mantra we always work on is that spillovers are common, but pandemics are rare because so many unlucky things have to happen in sequence. But pandemics are a game of roulette: they rely on luck, and they can get dramatic pretty fast. Are we repeating the mistakes of the early days of COVID? There are things we've learned and things we haven't learned. One of the biggest challenges with this is: it involves humans and animals, so there are a lot of players—we have multiple agencies working in their lane. I've been impressed with how the CDC has been updating the public, and I hope that's because they learned their lesson during COVID. Other players haven't necessarily learned those lessons because they weren't in the COVID trenches. One key difference [with bird flu] is: this hasn't seen human-to-human spread. We're not talking about January through March 2020. I do think that we are watching this unfold in real time better than we did with COVID, which seemed to be coming out of nowhere, so that gives me a little more hope. How have scientists been tracking the spread of bird flu in cows? We don't have a good sense of the spread because testing is voluntary and certainly not being done in a systematic way. We're pretty much flying blind with the testing aspect. But we have had two clues that this virus has spread very widely: The Food and Drug Administration found viral fragments in milk. And genomic surveillance estimates that spillover to dairy cows started back in December 2023, if not earlier, which means this has been spreading under our noses for a much longer time than we originally thought. That means our surveillance systems are not great. It also means we haven't been testing enough. We don't think that this means the virus is being spread to humans, but it may mean that H5N1 is starting to find a new host in cows, which would not be great news. Should people be worried about getting the H5N1 virus from milk? It sounds scary, and I understand the concern. One thing that has made me calm down is knowing that we've had, like, 100 years of data around pasteurization, and it works really well. We also got confirmation that scientists were not able to grow active virus from the milk samples, which were pasteurized. That means these virus fragments detected in milk were broken pieces that cannot replicate and thus cannot harm humans. This is a good sign. Do we know how the virus jumped into cows or how it's spreading? From the genomic surveillance, it looks like the spread to cows was likely from one source—probably a dead bird. One hypothesis is that the virus got into cow feed, and then cows ate it, and then it started spreading from cow to cow through the milk machines. But a lot of this is still up in the air. Veterinarians swabbing cows have found the most virus in the udders, but they have found other positive swabs from, for example, lung tissue. So how is this actually spreading? We think it's the milk machines spreading the virus from cow to cow, but we need to make sure that it's not via respiratory transmission as well. A huge new puzzle is that there is also transmission from cows to poultry. That is concerning; it gives this virus even more opportunity to adapt because it keeps jumping from species to species, and we don't know how. Is it through humans? Is it through rats? Is it through feed? We don't know. Trying to get a really good understanding of epidemiology here has been challenging just because the data are limited, and the communication is suboptimal. The CDC says there has only been one case in humans from this outbreak. How plausible is that? I'm a little skeptical because we haven't been doing asymptomatic testing, and symptomatic testing is voluntary. There have been reports this week that there are other humans who had symptoms who didn't test. Until we start seeing data, I don't think we should come to sweeping conclusions that it's only one human case. The good news is that it doesn't seem like anyone's died yet, and we're not seeing huge clusters [of sick people] in emergency departments. So if there are more human cases, I'm pretty confident they're from direct contact with cows rather than human-to-human transmission. But we need more data and more communication around this. Many people who have close contact with cows are migrant workers, some of whom are likely undocumented. Does that make them less likely to report any flu symptoms? Yeah, there are so many layers to this. If they test positive, they're not going to be able to work, and that has huge implications for their family. The other two big challenges that the CDC brought up publicly are that there's a language barrier and that some of these people are undocumented workers with a lack of trust in government institutions. Are we monitoring the virus in wastewater like we did for the virus that causes COVID? One huge lesson we learned during the COVID pandemic is the value of wastewater. This is a perfect case to leverage this massive network that we built to try and figure out how and where H5N1 is spreading, given the limitations and biases of testing right now. What's been disappointing is that the government has not officially shared any [flu data from] wastewater. To monitor human infections, the CDC said that they're utilizing emergency department data, which is great. But once an outbreak hits emergency departments among humans, it's already kind of out of control, so I would love to see wastewater surveillance leveraged a whole lot more. If we need vaccines and treatments for bird flu, how prepared are we? The government has confirmed that tools such as Tamiflu [an antiviral medication] would work to a certain extent against H5N1. Of course, Tamiflu is not very effective even against our seasonal flu. We also have stockpiled H5N1 vaccines that are predicted to have efficacy if this does move to humans, which is great news. [Editor's Note: These vaccines require two doses per person. The U.S. government says it has some 10 million doses available and could make about 125 million or so within four months, which would total enough to cover about one fifth of the country.] But there are still a lot of unanswered questions: What about manufacturing and supply? What about the rest of the globe? What about vaccine hesitancy and declining trust and access problems? Fully relying on vaccines and overconfidence were some of the biggest mistakes of the COVID emergency, and I think it's best to face these threats and questions with a level of humility and determination. When should people who work with livestock get access to those vaccines? I don't know what that line is, when we're like, 'This is an 'oh, shit' moment versus a 'watch and see moment.' Getting that line incorrect has massive implications. Certainly if we start seeing any trace of human-to-human transmission, we would really need to start ramping up. If we start seeing transmission in pigs, that would make me incredibly nervous. Pigs are a really great mixing vessel for influenza, so it would be incredibly easy for this virus to start mutating in a way that would have implications for humans. Veterinarians are continuing to test pigs for H5N1, and they have so far been negative, so I'm really happy we're on top of that. What's missing from the U.S.'s H5N1 response right now? We need a coordinated response from our government. I get that there are multiple players who have their own priorities and legal authorities, but honest, frequent, direct communication earns the public's trust and confidence. When communities are starved for good information during outbreaks, it leads to unnecessary anxiety, confusion and frustration. The winds may be changing in this area, but we need to get better faster. On the ground, we really need to get a handle on where H5N1 is spreading and how. That comes through asymptomatic testing of animals and people, sharing genomic surveillance data with the global community and understanding wastewater trends. So certainly, a lot more work needs to be done. How worried should people be right now? This is not a concern for the average American unless they're working with livestock. What I tell my mom, for example, is that the general public doesn't have to worry. This is very low-risk to them at the moment. But that could change. I think the most we can do is to know that this is going on and to pay attention to the status of the situation by finding trusted sources of information.

{"id": "501", "title": "Spikes of flu virus in wastewater raise questions about spread of bird flu", "date": "2024-04-30", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Spikes of influenza A virus seen in wastewater samples from 59 sewer systems across 18 different states this spring may point to the spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that is currently infecting dairy cattle, a new study suggests. So far, the US Department of Agriculture has reported more than 30 herds of dairy cows infected with H5N1 influenza across nine states. But there are questions about how large the outbreak might be and whether the US can adequately track it. In a news conference last week, USDA officials admitted that it's been difficult to get milk producers to let them test for the infection. Recent tests of milk purchased at grocery stores found genetic material from the H5N1 virus in 1 out of 5 samples tested, though further testing showed the virus fragments detected in milk were not infectious. Last week, in a multi-agency news conference on the government's response to the spreading virus, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency was looking at whether it might be feasible to use wastewater to pinpoint areas where the virus is spreading. First, he said, scientists would need to develop a test that could distinguish H5 influenza from the larger soup of circulating A-strain flu viruses. Now scientists at Emory, Stanford and Verily Life Sciences, a research organization affiliated with the WastewaterSCAN network that monitors a large network of wastewater treatment plants across the US, say they have done just that. Wastewater testing is a passive way of tracking the spread of infections. It doesn't depend on people or animals to be swabbed to test for pathogens. Instead, evidence flows into the wastewater every time a toilet is flushed or someone dumps material down a drain. Out of 190 wastewater treatment plants that currently monitor sludge samples for influenza A, 59 saw increases of the A-strain viruses this spring, just as human flu cases were flat or falling. Wastewater experts wondered if it might be from H5N1, the highly pathogenic avian influenza infections in dairy cattle or other animals. The WastewaterSCAN team developed a test to check for the flu virus' H5 gene and used it on stored samples from sewer systems near areas in Texas where dairy cattle had tested positive, but not including wastewater directly from the farms. The team measured both a genetic marker for influenza A viruses and genetic markers specific to H5 viruses. As levels of the marker for influenza A viruses began to rise in early March, the markers for the H5 viruses began to rise in tandem. The concentration of the H5 gene in the samples was nearly as high as the concentration of the influenza A viruses overall, suggesting that a large fraction of the viruses in the samples were H5N1. What's more, the concentrations of influenza A viruses measured in these wastewater sludge samples from the Amarillo, Texas, area were \"among the highest ever measured in wastewater,\" the study noted. The stored sludge samples tested for the study were taken between February 4 and April 16 at two treatment plants sites in the City of Amarillo watershed, and a third wastewater treatment plant in Dallas County. The researchers confirmed wastewater processing plants sampled in the Amarillo area permitted some producers to dispose of animal byproducts, including dumped milk from dairies, which may explain the high concentrations of influenza A viruses, and H5 viruses in their samples. Just as wastewater testing has proven to be a harbinger of rising Covid-19 infections in the past, researchers say their study suggests it could be an early warning for bird flu outbreaks in farm animals, too. \"We detected the H5 marker right before there was confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in those counties,\" said Dr. Alexandria Boehm, who is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University. \"I think that is super interesting. It means that the wastewater in this particular case, with this particular pathogen, can reveal information about what was circulating in these cattle before there was information publicly available,\" Boehm said. The paper was posted as a preprint on the BioRxiv server, ahead of rigorous review by outside experts. The researchers say they are working to get it published in a scientific journal. The study authors stress that no H5N1 outbreaks in cows have been reported in any of the sewersheds they tested. Instead, they think that the permitted dumping of milk likely caused the big spikes in H5 virus they saw in early March. The researchers note that they can't rule out that the H5 genetic material they're picking up in the wastewater is all from dairy cattle. It could also be from birds or even humans. The researchers say they also don't have enough information to know where the increases in influenza A virus are coming from across multiple states. \"We don't know the answer to that question. It is something that I think needs to be followed up on,\" Boehm said. But if the spike in viruses is from dumped milk or other animal waste across the sewersheds they monitor — and that's still a pretty big if — it means the outbreak is likely far more widespread than is currently known. \"If dairy industry activities in these sewersheds are a primary source of H5 in wastewater, this suggests that there may be additional, unidentified outbreaks among cattle with milk sent to these facilities since milk from infected animals is required to be diverted from the food supply,\" the study authors note. But the researchers also say their results should be interpreted carefully. Without tracking down possible sources in the sewersheds they monitor, the source of the virus can't be proven. \"However, multiple lines of evidence suggest animal sources,\" the paper says. The researchers say their testing method is very sensitive. It can detect even small amounts of the genetic material from the H5 viruses, but they can't tell if the viruses would be able to infect people and make them sick. Boehm says they didn't try to culture the virus to see if it could infect cells. The US Food and Drug Administration said last week that it has been testing samples of pasteurized milk in which traces of the H5N1 virus have been detected and so far found the milk is not infectious and cannot make people sick. The wastewater researchers acknowledge that it's also possible that their tests are picking up other types of H5 viruses, including low-pathogenic H5 influenza viruses, but they say these are not expected to be circulating in these areas at this time. \"This is a situation where we really felt like we were ethically bound to share this information with colleagues through a preprint and get the conversation going, because there are unanswered questions that are really important to answer,\" Boehm said.", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "Boehm says they didn't try to culture the virus to see if it could infect cells.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The concentration of the H5 gene in the samples was nearly as high as the concentration of the influenza A viruses overall, suggesting that a large fraction of the viruses in the samples were H5N1.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "The researchers note that they can't rule out that the H5 genetic material they're picking up in the wastewater is all from dairy cattle.

{"id": "502", "title": "What we�e starting to learn about H5N1 in cows, and the risk to people", "date": "2024-04-30", "fulltext": "The H5N1 bird flu virus has been around for decades, and the damage it wreaks on chickens and other poultry is well documented. But the recent discovery that the virus has jumped into dairy cattle—whose udders seem to be where the virus either infects or migrates to—has dumbfounded scientists and agricultural authorities. Questions for which there are pretty clear answers when it comes to birds are suddenly unsettled science in cows. How are they getting infected? Are they transmitting the virus cow to cow, or are human actions—activities that are part of the day-to-day of farming—serving as an unrecognized amplifier of viral transmission? In the interface between infected cows and humans, how might people be at risk? Does consuming milk laced with live H5 virus pose a hazard? At this point in the H5N1-in-cows story, these are questions that don’t have solid answers, though some evidence is coming into focus. Getting answers is critical, for controlling spread among cows, if that’s still possible; stopping transmission from cows to key species like poultry or pigs; and keeping the virus from getting a foothold in the human population. Let’s explore the little we know, and the much more we don’t know. Are cows spreading the virus the way people transmit flu? Wash your hands; cover your cough; wear a mask. These are things public health officials advise at the start of each flu season. That’s because the influenza viruses that typically infect humans spread primarily through the air either through small, virus-laced particles that can be inhaled, or through larger droplets that spray out of a sick person’s mouth when they cough or sneeze. Related: Massive amounts of H5N1 vaccine would be needed if there’s a bird flu pandemic. Can we make enough? Scientists are now trying to figure out if cows are passing around the H5N1 bird flu in the same way. So far, it seems possible, but unlikely to be the main driver of disease transmission. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said few tests from the respiratory tracts of infected cows have come back positive and those that did showed there wasn’t a lot of virus present. But there is at least some evidence that H5N1 is on occasion getting deep into the respiratory tracts of cows. The USDA said in a frequently asked questions document it released last week that its National Veterinary Services Laboratories had found H5N1 in a lung tissue sample from an asymptomatic dairy cow that originated from an affected herd. So what is the main driver of infection among cows? While the contribution of respiratory transmission is still in question, there appears to be little doubt that a lot of spread is happening in milking parlors, where cows are strapped into the milking machines, and that in dairy cows, H5N1 seems to be primarily infecting mammary glands. The amount of virus in the udders of infected cows is off-the-charts high, making it easy to see how one cow’s infection soon becomes a herd’s problem. “You can imagine that if such a cow is milked in a milking stall, even a few drops of milk remaining on the teat cup which is used to milk will then subsequently contaminate the teat of the next cow,” said Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. “So you can imagine very easily how, in the course of a few days, the virus could spread very fast among the cows being milked on that farm.” That fits with other evidence: the fact that infections so far appear to be limited to lactating dairy cows, and that the members of a herd that are the biggest milk producers which are also the animals that stay on milking machines the longest are the ones most heavily impacted by the disease. “There’s still a lot that’s unknown, but what we’re seeing right now is not a respiratory disease by and large; it’s a mastitic disease,” said Jared Taylor, a professor of veterinary pathobiology at Oklahoma State University. For now, that’s somewhat reassuring, because it means that increased attention to sterilization and disinfection during milking should make a dent in the virus’s further spread. But he stressed that it’s still early and researchers are just starting to study the extent to which there could be respiratory involvement. Related: There’s never a good time to drink raw milk. But now’s a really bad time as bird flu infects cows Taylor noted another worry: H5N1, which is notorious for its ability to evolve, is being given a huge opportunity to adapt to bovine hosts. “The concern is if it becomes effective as a respiratory pathogen in cattle, it’s more likely to become effective as a respiratory pathogen in humans,” he said. When are infected cows most contagious? Little is known about how a cow’s contagiousness changes over the course of an infection with H5N1. Researchers examining outbreaks among dairy cattle in Kansas and Texas found that on affected farms, incidence of the disease peaked four to six days after the first animals began showing symptoms such as lethargy, fever, reduced feed intake, and an abrupt drop in milk production. The spread tapered off within 10 to 14 days, and most animals were slowly returned to regular milking after they recovered. But researchers have not yet systematically and repeatedly collected samples from affected animals to understand how much virus they are harboring inside their noses or shedding into milk over the course of their infection. Those are among the types of studies that are urgently needed, Donald Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration, said during an online symposium last week organized by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). “As these animals become infected, what does that profile look like for viral shedding?” Such research would help answer the question of how much H5N1 virus a cow needs to come in contact with to get infected the so-called “infectious dose.” Right now, that remains unknown, Prater said. Can cows be infected but not show symptoms? Can those cows shed virus in milk or spread virus to other cows? There’s been so little testing going on and so little disclosed about the numerators and denominators of that testing that it’s hard to gauge how big an issue asymptomatic infection is and what role, if any, it is playing in transmission within and among herds. But the information USDA released about the virus having been found in the lung of an asymptomatic cow is clear proof that not all infected cows have outward signs of illness. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy Rosemary Sifford, the agency’s chief veterinary officer, said during the ASTHO symposium that little is known about cow-to-cow spread via the respiratory route, but she gave an example of apparent transmission from presymptomatic animals. (A person with flu can be contagious a day before developing symptoms.) Sifford noted that cows in a herd without symptoms tested positive after cattle were moved into it from another herd whose remaining animals then went on to develop symptoms. The positive cows in the second herd haven’t developed symptoms, she said. “We are just getting underway with those studies to give us an idea of the opportunity for viremia either ahead of or after clinical signs,” she said. “So we should have more information about that in the coming weeks.” One such study will be taking place in the high-containment laboratories at Kansas State University’s Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases. Director Jürgen Richt said his group already has the necessary approvals and hopes to begin the research in mid-May. They will be experimentally infecting lactating and non-lactating cows with the version of H5N1 that has been found in cattle herds, both by the oral-nasal route and by directly injecting the virus into udders. The goal: To see where the virus goes in the cows and how they shed it. Is it just found in milk? Or in feces and urine too? Some uninfected cows will be housed with the infected animals to see whether they contract the virus, Richt said. As to whether infected cows that have no symptoms are shedding virus in their milk, the evidence of viral traces in commercially purchased milk brings that question to the forefront. Farmers are supposed to discard milk from infected cows, which reportedly looks odd yellowish and unusually thick. But PCR testing of commercially sold pasteurized milk has shown a substantial portion of samples were positive for RNA from H5N1, indicating the presence of either viral fragments or dead viruses. (The FDA said last week about one in five samples purchased in a cross-country survey tested positive.) So either some farmers aren’t following the recommendation, or some milk isn’t noticeably altered, or some cows that aren’t known to be sick are shedding the virus in their milk. What is it about milking parlors that allows transmission to occur? Milking parlors are typically enclosed buildings outfitted with individual stalls arranged in a ring or in rows where dairy cows are led two to three times each day to drain their udders of milk. In a milking operation, the stimulus to secrete milk comes not from the sight or touch of a calf but is usually provided by a farm worker. That person also cleans the animal’s teats with a damp cloth and then dips them into a disinfectant solution to protect them from infectious bacteria present on a farm. The teats are then attached to the milking unit, also called a claw, which consists of a cluster of four rubber or silicon-based liners that fit snugly around each teat. The milking lasts about six to nine minutes per animal, and then each cow receives another disinfectant treatment before it’s ushered out and another animal is brought in. Related: Cattle testing for H5N1 bird flu will be more limited than USDA initially announced The problem is that the milking equipment that comes into contact with the cow’s udders is typically not sanitized between individual animals, said Nigel Cook, a professor in Food Animal Production Medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and long-time dairy cow health researcher. Rather, sanitization steps happen only two or three times a day. “Contamination of the milking unit with milk residue cross-contaminating to the next cow would be a risk as it would with any mastitis pathogen,” Cook told STAT via email. Liners also have to be regularly replaced, as wear and tear and chemical exposure make them lose their elasticity, becoming rough and split. When that happens, the liners are more difficult to disinfect and can act as a reservoir for infection. Liners, dip cups, washrags, and milkers’ gloved hands are all possible means of spreading the virus from one animal to the next. Washrags used on different animals are often laundered together before repeat use, but some dairies don’t use hot water, and researchers have found genetic traces of H5N1 on both used and clean rags using PCR testing. More work is needed to figure out which vectors are playing the biggest role, scientists told STAT. Kuiken is a bit pessimistic about whether, once the virus has found its way into a herd, transmission can be stopped: “You can’t not milk. And you probably can’t milk so well as to prevent cow-to-cow spread. I don’t think you can do it.” What puts people working on dairy farms at highest risk? Only one human infection a Texas dairy farm worker who developed conjunctivitis has been reported, but anecdotal reports abound of other farm workers with conjunctivitis and mild respiratory symptoms. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working to figure out where the biggest risks to these workers lie, Sonja Olsen, associate director for preparedness and response in CDC’s influenza division, said during the ASTHO symposium. Is it exposure to cows? Contact with milk? Are there specific activities on farms or in slaughterhouses that put people at elevated risk of contracting H5N1? The CDC recommends that people working with or around cattle suspected or confirmed to be infected with H5N1 wear gloves, disposable fluid-resistant coveralls, vented safety goggles or a face shield, and an N95 respirator. Related: Washington kicks into gear on H5N1 Kuiken said the setup of many milking parlors is almost tailor-made to put workers in contact with viruses being shed in milk. That’s because there is typically a well think of the area under the hoist in the garage where your car gets repaired where workers are located while cows are being milked. “So the milk worker is standing in a depressed area, and therefore his eyes are about at knee level a little bit higher, maybe with the cow. So very good for being inoculated, for eye infection,” he said. “They can milk the cow beforehand just a little bit, and the spray of milk will come out of the teat. That’s one way of getting infected. Taking off or putting on the teat cups is one way. The cows are defecating and urinating during the milking process, or afterwards. They clean the [milking parlor] using a high-pressure hose. So there are all different ways in which these milk workers can easily become infected.” Cook is also concerned about the possibility that the high pressure hoses that are used to spray down the parlors after milking may be aerosolizing virus that has fallen to the floor, making it easier for cows and humans to breathe in. He and other colleagues at the University of Wisconsin have begun deploying air monitoring devices into the milking parlors of affected farms to investigate the extent to which they can find genetic evidence of the virus in the air. If so many dairy farm workers have been and are being exposed to H5N1, why has only one human infection been confirmed? Is that plausible? Not likely. Farmers, who mostly haven’t been willing to have their cows tested, haven’t been keen to have their workers tested either. The CDC’s Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, admitted as much last week. “These situations are challenging. There may be owners that are reluctant to work with public health to say nothing of individual workers who may be reluctant to sit down with somebody who identifies themself as being from the government in some way.” There have been reports that some farms may employ undocumented workers. Related: Genetic analysis reveals H5N1 flu virus outbreak in cows likely started earlier than thought Dairy farm workers presenting with milder signs of illness, like conjunctivitis, also would make cases harder to spot. If only conjunctivitis is occurring, though, that presents another potential clue that people aren’t currently getting sick by breathing in H5N1, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who studies emerging zoonotic pathogens at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. In the rare cases where people have contracted H5N1 from birds mostly poultry farm workers and people with small backyard flocks infections have resulted from close contact or exposure to aerosolized poultry waste. Since 2003, there have been 889 confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1; of those 52% were fatal. “It’s entirely possible that there have been a lot of human cases from cows and people are just getting it in a different way,” Rasmussen said. “What that says about the risks to farm workers and dairy processing staff on a given farm or milking parlor is really unclear to me and it’s also something we need to urgently catch up on.” Should more be done to find infected people? The World Health Organization appears to be concerned about the possibility of undetected human cases. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the department of epidemic and pandemic preparedness, told STAT she’d like to see, among other things, studies looking for antibodies to H5N1 in the blood of farm workers and people who’ve been in contact with farm workers, to determine if there have been unreported cases and possibly even spread from those individuals to others. “For every human case of avian influenza since its emergence in 1996, 1997, there has always been … active case-finding, extensive testing, serologic surveys around humans. And we would certainly want to see that in any country, including in the U.S.,” said Van Kerkhove. “I’ve heard and read quite a bit about some potential additional cases. We’ve heard maybe conjunctivitis or whatnot. But I think what’s really critical now is to understand the extent of infection in humans.” “The more we look, potentially the more we can find. And if we’re not looking, then we’re perhaps missing something that could be quite significant.” Could people become infected by drinking milk containing H5N1 viruses? Research is still being done to determine if all pasteurization techniques there are multiple approaches inactivate the virus. But the findings so far are reassuring. Scientists at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., have reported that while they could find genetic evidence of the virus in milk bought in stores, they could not grow live viruses from that milk, suggesting pasteurization kills H5N1. But given the concentration of virus that researchers are seeing in milk from infected cows, they believe that raw milk milk that has not been pasteurized is an entirely different story. Because so little testing has been reported, it’s really not known how many herds in how many parts of the country have been or are currently infected with H5N1. The USDA has reported 34 outbreaks in nine states since late March. It has not disclosed whether any of those dairy farms sold raw milk. Nor is it known if any raw milk producers have had bird flu infections in their cows. If cows that produce milk destined for the raw milk market got infected with H5N1, people who consume that milk could drink a large dose of the virus, scientists say. Kuiken said he’s heard of concentrations that would be the equivalent of a billion virus particles per milliliter of milk.

{"id": "503", "title": "US to test ground beef in states with dairy cows infected with bird flu. What to know.", "date": "2024-04-30", "fulltext": "The U.S. government says it will begin testing samples of ground beef at stores in states with outbreaks of bird flu in dairy cows. Federal officials are looking to verify the safety of beef and milk after 34 dairy cattle herds in nine states and one person in Texas tested positive for the H5N1 virus since late March. Although testing is ongoing, the overall public health risk is low, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization said. But those who were exposed to infected animals are at a higher risk. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is confident that the meat supply is safe, agency spokesperson Shilo Weir told USA TODAY in an email Tuesday. The agency's rigorous meat inspection process involves having veterinarians at all federal livestock slaughter facilities, Weir said. Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said that fragments of the virus were found in samples of pasteurized milk, but officials weren't concerned about danger to humans from drinking store-bought milk. The milk that tested positive came from a limited number of tests that were done on milk from grocery stores. Now the FDA is conducting further analysis and teaming up with the USDA, the CDC and other state partners to investigate further. Here's what consumers should know about the virus. Why are officials testing ground beef? While there's no known case of bird flu virus being found in ground beef, the USDA will begin testing ground beef at stores in states where dairy cows have been found to have bird flu. The samples will be analyzed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service using tests that detect whether any viral particles are present, the agency said. Two other safety studies will be conducted, as well, because some dairy cows are processed into ground beef when they grow old. The Food Safety and Inspection Service will collect muscle samples from dairy cattle being at slaughter facilities, and those samples will also undergo tests. The agency will do additional testing for live virus on any positive tests from muscle samples and retail ground beef, and do cooking studies of ground beef to determine what temperatures are needed to kill the virus, the USDA says. Can you get bird flu from drinking infected milk at grocery stores? Officials previously told USA TODAY that Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or HPAI, was present, the pasteurization process works to inactivate viruses and that results don't indicate that the virus is infectious. To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe, said the USDA in a statement. What is pasteurization? According to the USDA, it is the process that kills harmful bacteria and viruses by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time to make milk safer. If the virus is detected in unpasteurized milk, the USDA expects the process will still eliminate pathogens so it doesn't pose a risk to people's health. The FDA requires that anything labeled and sold as milk across state borders must be pasteurized, the CDC says. Which states are affected? Nine states have confirmed cases of the virus in dairy cows, the USDA says. * Colorado * Idaho * Kansas * Michigan * New Mexico * North Carolina * Ohio * South Dakota * Texas Is it safe to eat eggs and chicken because of bird flu concerns? You should avoid foods such as unpasteurized milk, cheeses made from unpasteurized milk, and raw and undercooked eggs, poultry, and meat, said Barbara Kowalcyk, associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. Those foods and fish can carry foodborne pathogens bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins that can make people ill, she said. Be sure to cook raw meat, poultry, fish, eggs and milk thoroughly before feeding them to yourself or your family, Kowalcyk said. Color and consistency are not good indicators of doneness so it is best to use a digital, tip-sensitive food thermometer. Check for recommended food temperatures on the Department of Health and Human Services website. It is also recommended that people avoid direct contact with infected live or dead animals or surfaces contaminated by them, Kowalcyk said. It is advised to use personal protective equipment if you must come in contact with infected live or dead animals.

{"id": "504", "title": "This Texas veterinarian helped crack the mystery of bird flu in cows", "date": "2024-05-01", "fulltext": "The first calls that Dr. Barb Petersen received in early March were from dairy owners worried about crows, pigeons and other birds dying on their Texas farms. Then came word that barn cats—half of them on one farm—had died suddenly. Within days, the Amarillo veterinarian was hearing about sick cows with unusual symptoms: high fevers, reluctance to eat and much less milk. Tests for typical illnesses came back negative. Petersen, who monitors more than 40,000 cattle on a dozen farms in the Texas Panhandle, collected samples from cats and cows and sent them to Dr. Drew Magstadt, a friend from college who now works at the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University. The samples tested positive for a bird flu virus never before seen in cattle. It was the first proof that the bird flu, known as Type A H5N1, could infect cows. As of Wednesday, 36 U.S. herds had confirmed infections, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. \"It was just a surprise,\" recalled Petersen. \"It was just a little bit of disbelief.\" At the same time, on almost every farm with sick animals, Petersen said she saw sick people, too. \"We were actively checking on humans,\" Petersen said. \"I had people who never missed work, miss work.\" So far, two people in the U.S. have been confirmed to be infected with H5N1, most recently a Texas dairy worker linked to the cattle outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two dozen people have been tested and about 100 people have been monitored since the virus appeared in cows, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, told reporters Wednesday. Daskalakis said CDC has seen no unusual flu trends in areas with infected cows, but some experts wonder if anecdotal reports of sick workers mean more than one person caught the virus from the animals. Petersen said some workers had symptoms consistent with flu: fever and body aches, stuffy nose or congestion. Some had conjunctivitis, the eye inflammation detected in the Texas dairy worker diagnosed with bird flu. Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, has been taking samples from livestock and people on two Texas farms. On farms with confirmed cattle infections, there have also been reports of mild illnesses among the workers, he said. His research has been difficult. Many workers are reluctant to be tested. That may be because they have limited access to health care or fear divulging private health information. Without confirmation, no one knows if the sick workers were infected with the bird flu virus or something unrelated, Gray said. \"They seem to be linked in time and space, so one would say it's biologically plausible,\" said Gray. Some of the workers who fell ill sought treatment and were offered oseltamivir, an antiviral drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu, Petersen said. Some farm workers who were exposed to infected animals or people were offered the medication, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. State health officials are responsible for evaluating and providing treatment, according to federal guidelines. Health officials in Texas provided Tamiflu to the person known to be infected with H5N1 and household members, plus two people on a second dairy farm who tested negative but were exposed to infected animals, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he wasn't sure if others had been offered the antiviral. Farmers have been hesitant to allow health officials onto their land, said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted about the outbreak with Petersen. \"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" Russo said. \"It has this stigma associated with it right now.\" Russo called for wider testing of cattle, people and milk. \"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\" Gray worries that a recent federal order requiring testing of all lactating dairy cows moving between states could hinder cooperation even further. All labs that conduct tests must report positive results to the Agriculture Department. But many farmers may simply decide against testing, hoping to outlast the outbreak, he said. The reluctance of workers and farmers to allow testing is \"greatly hampering\" understanding of how the virus spreads, how large the outbreak is now and how quickly it may grow, Gray said. \"It's a negative, very negative, effect,\" he said. Petersen said she understands workers' and farmers' fears. She praised the farmers who had been willing to let her gather the first samples that confirmed the outbreak and reflected on what the results could mean. \"You immediately think about the cows, the people that care for them and the families that have these farms,\" she said. \"You're thinking about the big picture, long term.

{"id": "506", "title": "Who Could Catch Bird Flu First? These Experts Have an Idea, and a Way to Help.", "date": "2024-05-01", "fulltext": "H5N1 is in a better position than ever to move between species and spill over aggressively into humans: This bird flu virus is now thought to have been spreading among dairy cows for many months, and federal regulators have found viral fragments circulating widely in the commercial milk supply chain across the United States (though live virus has not been found). The one person we know of so far who has tested positive for infection (a mild case) was a Texas dairy worker. Agricultural workers have always been an underprotected population for zoonotic diseases, including influenza viruses of animal origin. When it comes to H5N1, the dairy work force—which includes on-farm workers and milkers, people working in the milk processing plants and in slaughterhouses, truck drivers and other professionals who come onto farms—is among those with the highest exposure. Not only do we owe these at-risk workers better protection, but we also must do a much better job—immediately—of monitoring and testing them to ensure the virus doesn’t spread beyond our control. Otherwise, we might not find out about a significant outbreak in humans until it’s too late. So far, bird flu testing of this cohort has been woefully inadequate. Testing is usually under the purview of state authorities following federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Tests are recommended for symptomatic workers. The exact number of dairy workers and other people who have so far been tested for H5N1 is not publicly available at the federal level. There is no excuse to continue only limited testing of this vulnerable population. Any serious surveillance efforts of H5N1 demand that the country do better to ensure proper testing and health care is provided to these workers now, lest we risk being caught flat-footed by a new pandemic so soon after Covid. This is especially important for a work force whose broader social and economic circumstances may discourage them from seeking out timely testing and treatment. A majority of hired farmworkers in the United States are from Mexico and Central American countries; many lack authorization to work here legally. Undocumented workers may be worried about public health reporting systems putting them at risk for immigration enforcement or preventing future chances of gaining a visa or permanent residency status. Communication is a further concern. According to a 2019 survey, over half of U.S. dairies have employees whose native language is not English; these individuals most often speak Spanish, but some speak only Indigenous languages such as K’iche’ or Nahuatl. Many workers have limited literacy and education that dairy farms accommodate with pictorial signage and visual training materials. Any effective bird flu education campaign would have to be similarly tailored to these workers’ communication needs—a capacity that not many health departments have. These workers are further endangered from a public health standpoint thanks to the industry’s low wages and benefits and lack of enforcement for health and safety standards. In 2019, the Center for North American Studies reported an average hourly starting wage of $11.24 for novice dairy workers, and an average hourly wage among all dairy workers of $13.90. It also found that more than 40 percent of U.S. dairy farms do not provide health insurance, and only 47 percent offer paid sick leave. Significant income could be lost while traveling to distant rural health services for an eye infection or flulike symptoms—health conditions that a majority of the work force reasonably brush off. Even worse outcomes may go unreported out of a fear of losing out on work. Farms across the country also need to make these workers’ day-to-day tasks safer. Some state surveys have shown that many dairy worker respondents lacked personal protective gear such as masks, goggles, gloves and aprons, or were noncompliant in its use despite the risks of infectious disease exposure. When protected, dairy farm workers can be a force multiplier for surveillance and resilience efforts around emerging disease threats like H5N1. Individuals who work with livestock on a daily basis, given the right training from the U.S. Department of Agriculture or other veterinary professionals, can serve as field-based surveillance teams; their frequent interaction with animals means they are the first to notice abnormalities in demeanor, physical appearance or production of eggs and milk. They can share information among peers and be provided a public platform like ProMED (the disease outbreak communication system for the International Society for Infectious Diseases) for anonymously reporting infectious diseases to local, state or federal public health authorities. The federal government and state officials can increase support of local surveillance programs, and reduce economic barriers for dairy owners who want to provide better access to health care services for employees. These efforts are about more than just responding to bird flu and preventing a human outbreak. Our agricultural industry will always be on the front lines against zoonotic disease threats. We need to empower it to protect workers from these biological dangers, not just for the workers but for all of us. Providing widespread H5N1 testing now to the dairy work force is a necessary step—but only the first. Erin M. Sorrell is a senior scholar and associate professor at Johns Hopkins University.

{"id": "507", "title": "Bird Flu Highlights Concerns Around Raw Milk", "date": "2024-05-01", "fulltext": "Testing suggests that pasteurization inactivates the virus. But what about raw milk and cheese? While maintaining that avian influenza poses a low risk to the general public, health officials again warned on Wednesday about the potential risk of unpasteurized milk. 'We continue to strongly advise against the consumption of raw milk,' Dr. Donald Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration, said at a news conference. Raw milk, in the best of times, 'is one of the riskiest foods that we have,' said Benjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University. But with cases of avian influenza, or bird flu, detected in dairy cows, it could potentially be even riskier now, health experts warn. Nearly all of the dairy milk sold in stores is pasteurized, and testing by the F.D.A. has so far shown that this process inactivates the avian influenza virus H5N1. If you're consuming pasteurized milk or dairy products, 'I'm confident the risk is extraordinarily low at this point,' said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health. Raw milk, on the other hand, isn't pasteurized and can contain dangerous germs. While the Food and Drug Administration has long recommended consumers avoid drinking it, more than two dozen states have legalized the sale of raw milk. The same bacteria that commonly cause food-borne illnesses, like salmonella, E. coli and listeria, can fester in raw milk. Between 1998 and 2018, researchers linked over 200 outbreaks, which sickened 2,645 people and led to 228 hospitalizations, to raw milk. People who are very young or very old, are pregnant or have compromised immune systems are particularly likely to get seriously ill from the pathogens in raw milk, said Darin Detwiler, a food safety expert and professor at the College of Professional Studies at Northeastern University. Can you catch bird flu from raw milk? Dr. Rosemary Sifford, deputy administrator of veterinary services at the Department of Agriculture, said in the Wednesday briefing that testing has found a 'high viral load' in raw cow's milk, and that federal officials believe that the primary way the virus is spreading between cows is through contact with milk. Government agencies are continuing to test samples from affected herds, according to the F.D.A. Researchers and health officials are not sure whether bird flu can spread from raw milk to humans. 'There's not a tremendous amount of studies showing the infectivity related to this virus and raw milk products,' Dr. Prater said. But, he said, agencies are continuing to monitor the issue as new research emerges. On Wednesday, the F.D.A. said it 'recommends that industry does not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products.' The agency has also recommended producers discard milk from affected cows and pasteurize raw milk from exposed cattle before feeding it to animals. Some researchers think it is unlikely that bird flu can transmit to humans through raw milk, but Dr. Meghan Davis, a veterinarian and environmental epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that she was concerned about this possibility, in part because cats on dairy farms have been sickened by the virus. In a study published Monday, researchers described a group of about two dozen cats that were fed raw milk from cows with avian influenza on a Texas dairy farm. More than half of the cats became ill and died; two of the deceased cats were tested and found to have been infected with the virus. It's possible they were sickened by eating wild birds, but raw milk was 'a likely route of exposure,' the researchers wrote. Dr. Blumberg noted that other influenza viruses that typically affect humans can spread if people touch surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touch their mouths, noses or eyes. Avian influenza may spread similarly, he said, including through handling or consuming contaminated raw milk or cheese. There have been only two cases of avian influenza in humans reported in the United States since 2022; both people were exposed to infected animals and had mild illnesses. But the virus has caused severe illness in humans in the past, Dr. Blumberg said. What about cheeses made from raw milk? Or goat's milk? Some cheese-making processes can involve higher temperatures and pressures, which could inactivate the virus in raw milk, Dr. Davis said. Other steps, such as aging, could also affect virus survival. But at this stage, Dr. Davis said, it's hard to know how risky any given raw-milk cheese might be. It's also worth being cautious about raw-dairy products from goats or sheep, Dr. Davis said. Avian influenza was detected in young goats on a Minnesota farm in March; and while there haven't yet been cases reported in sheep, it's plausible that they could contract the virus, too, she added. How widespread is the virus? As of April 27, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had confirmed cases of avian influenza in dairy cows in nine states. But just because the virus hasn't been reported in a state it doesn't mean that it's not there, Dr. Davis said. The F.D.A. has reported finding inactive fragments of the virus in about 20 percent of pasteurized-milk samples from around the country, suggesting that the virus has spread more than animal testing has indicated, she said. 'We don't yet have a good grasp of just how widespread it is,' Dr. Davis said. Since wild birds can spread the virus, small farms can be affected as well as large ones, she said. 'The precautionary approach would be to avoid raw-dairy products altogether for the time being,' Dr. Davis said.

{"id": "508", "title": "Good Luck Isn�t Good Enough to Fight Bird Flu", "date": "2024-05-01", "fulltext": "There is good news and bad news about the continuing outbreak of H5N1, or avian influenza, among dairy cattle. The F.D.A.'s tests have confirmed that raw milk from infected cows has high viral loads but pasteurization successfully inactivates the virus, as expected. Raw, unpasteurized milk products should be avoided. Dr. Barb Petersen, a veterinarian who takes care of about a dozen cattle farms in Amarillo, Texas, told me she noticed how cats on one farm had died in droves and many cows were getting sick. We discussed the H5N1 outbreak among cats in Poland that I had investigated last year; the symptoms seemed similar to what she was observing: balance and vision problems, extreme fatigue, neurological problems and swift deaths. It was Dr. Petersen's persistence, not that of the U.S.D.A. or the C.D.C., that solved the mystery of widespread unexplained cow illness in Texas. When test after test for known pathogens on the growing number of sick cows came back negative, Dr. Petersen sent some samples to a college friend at Iowa State, Dr. Drew Magstadt, who suggested testing for H5N1. Those test results became the first proof that H5N1 was infecting cows. Dr. Petersen also told me that right when the cows got sick, an unusual number of people also got sick—some with flu symptoms and conjunctivitis, the key symptom in the only known human H5N1 case. She said that many farmworkers were reluctant to get tested and that some received generic flu treatment. Recently released data confirms that the undetected outbreak had indeed been in progress all winter—peak human flu season. Someone infected with both human and H5N1 influenza is exactly how a human pandemic could start. A new report on the sole confirmed human H5N1 case reveals that worryingly, the C.D.C. wasn't able to collect specimens from the farm where the infection took place or even get follow-up swabs from the infected person. The good news is that so far, we've been lucky. The middling news is that the U.S.D.A., the C.D.C. and the F.D.A. have been more forthcoming recently, but their scientific data sharing is still sluggish and incomplete, and testing is still far less than it should be. The bad news is that influenza is a fickle virus, and our luck could change in a flash.", "media_outlet": "NYTimes", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "The bad news is that influenza is a fickle virus, and our luck could change in a flash.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Someone infected with both human and H5N1 influenza is exactly how a human pandemic could start.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Influenza is a fickle virus, and our luck could change in a flash.", "affirm_why_count": 2, "affirm_keywords_count": 0, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_statement_1": "The good news is that so far, we've been lucky.", "deny_why_count": 1, "deny_keywords_statement_1": "Someone infected with both human and H5N1 influenza is exactly how a human pandemic could start.", "deny_keywords_count": 1}
{"id": "509", "title": "Continued FDA testing finds no active bird flu virus in variety of dairy products", "date": "2024-05-01", "fulltext": "(CNN) - Ongoing testing of milk and dairy products by the US Food and Drug Administration has not found any active H5N1 bird flu virus in 297 samples of products purchased in grocery stores, the agency said Wednesday. The FDA has tested samples of fluid milk and other kinds of products made from milk, like cheese and sour cream, as well as products made with milk powder such as infant and toddler formula. In the first set of 96 samples, the agency said, 20% - 1 in 5 - contained remnants of the H5N1 virus, but additional tests to see whether the virus could actively infect eggs determined that those viral traces were inactive and would not be able to make people sick. Results from an additional 201 samples were released Wednesday and also showed no evidence of active virus. The agency didn't say where the sampled products were purchased. \"These additional preliminary results further affirm the safety of the US commercial milk supply,\" said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The government is also testing samples of raw and cooked ground beef purchased at grocery stores, as well as pooled raw milk sent to processors for pasteurization. The FDA said it continues to strongly advise against consuming raw milk and recommends that the industry does not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products. The updates were part of a multiagency news conference on the government's actions to evaluate and contain the H5N1 bird flu outbreak among dairy cows, which has spread to about three dozen herds in nine states: Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, South Dakota and Colorado. The highest concentration of infected cattle is in Texas, where 12 herds have tested positive. The virus spreading in cows has not been shown to spread efficiently from person to person, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the public health risk is low. Only one person, a farm worker in Texas, has tested positive in connection to the outbreak. Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer for the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday that the agency believes the virus jumped from infected wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle. \"The initial spillover event in that geographic region likely was not an individual herd but a number of herds in that region, and then animals from those herds moving to other herds in other states were the initial movements of the virus,\" Sifford said. Cattle moving between states were probably asymptomatic, she said, and it may not have always been cows that were spreading the infection. \"In some cases, the movement of equipment or other items between herds, not necessarily cattle,\" she said. Sifford said that USDA and CDC scientists have not seen any genetic changes to the sequences they've analyzed that would facilitate the spread of this type of flu in people. The CDC said certain people are at higher risk of infection than others, including those who work with poultry and livestock on farms, veterinarians and slaughterhouse workers.

Early detection by monitoring wastewater can help short-circuit that cycle. It's difficult to tell what is happening right now with highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 (bird flu), which is rapidly spreading among cows and other mammals. The outbreak has raised concerns among virologists and epidemiologists that the current spread in mammals may allow the bird flu virus to adapt to mammalian physiology, pre-adapting it for sustained spread among humans, which could be catastrophic. These additional, preliminary results further affirm the safety of the U.S. commercial milk supply, Donald Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center of Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, told reporters. Last week, the FDA announced it had conducted PCR testing in 96 commercially purchased milk products and found genetic traces of the H5N1 virus in 1 in 5 samples, but that early data showed no live virus. On Wednesday, the agency reported results from testing of a further 201 products, which included cottage cheese and sour cream, in addition to milk. Any PCR-positive samples were then injected into embryonated chicken eggs, to see whether any active virus could be grown—the gold standard test for assessing the viability of an influenza virus. None of the samples produced viable, replicating virus, Prater said. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy The 297 samples that the FDA has tested so far represent dairy products from 38 states. In addition, several samples of retail powdered infant formula as well as other powdered milk products were tested. All PCR results from these products were negative. The agency did not disclose when it plans to make its full analysis, including which products were purchased from which states, available to the public. Bolstering the FDA's data, academic researchers at the Ohio State University and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital told STAT Tuesday night that their own study of 58 PCR-positive milk samples taken from Texas, Kansas, and eight other states in the Midwest also failed to turn up any evidence that H5N1 can survive the pasteurization process. Evidence of H5N1 bird flu found in grocery milk Share Watch on It was pretty much what we were expecting, said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude whose laboratory conducted the viral growth experiments in mammalian cell lines as well as embryonated chicken eggs. The samples they tested had varying levels of viral RNA, from very low to pretty large amounts, Webby said. Although it was nothing like what's been seen coming off the udders of infected cows. Certainly, the viral load is getting diluted, he said. But there was still enough RNA in the samples they were testing that if those levels had represented real, viable virus, he would have expected to be find it. If these samples had full virus particles capable of replication, we would have expected to see growth in cells and eggs, which we did not see. The conclusion is we simply don't think there's any replicating virus in these samples. What we're finding are probably just remnants of the virus. Related: There's never a good time to drink raw milk. But now's a really bad time as bird flu infects cows Webby and other scientists are more worried about possible health risks from drinking raw milk. Although little is currently known about the potential for humans contracting H5N1 from consuming raw milk from infected cows, researchers are raising the alarm that the consequences could be dire. In the wild, mammals like foxes, bears, and seals that have been sickened with H5N1 presumably from eating infected birds or drinking water contaminated with their feces have suffered severe symptoms, including brain damage and death. In humans we don't know how much milk you'd have to drink to get infected, or if 10 people drank raw milk from an infected cow how many would come down with it, Webby said. But it's not an experiment I'd want to participate in. The FDA is urging consumers not to drink raw milk or eat raw milk cheeses. That is a position the agency has long held, because of the other health risks these products hold, but it has re-emphasized it in the context of the current outbreak. We continue to strongly advise against the consumption of raw milk, Prater said at the news conference Wednesday. Related: What we're starting to learn about H5N1 in cows, and the risk to people He did not say whether the FDA has conducted any testing of raw milk products currently on the market. But it is testing samples of pooled raw milk—milk that is trucked in from multiple farms to centralized processing facilities where pasteurization takes place. This will be used to better understand how much virus from asymptomatic or presymptomatic animals is making it into the milk supply, and inform further studies to validate the effectiveness of different methods of pasteurization, Prater said. FDA has also recommended the dairy industry not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including raw milk cheese, made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those infected with avian influenza viruses or exposed to those infected with avian influenza viruses. It has also urged producers to discard milk from affected cows and pasteurize raw milk from exposed cattle before feeding it to other animals. Cats that have been fed raw milk from cows infected with H5N1 have been sickened and some have died, according to a study published Monday. So far, only one person—a farm worker in Texas who developed conjunctivitis—has been confirmed to be infected by dairy cows. H5N1 bird flu has been circulating in dairy cow herds in parts of the country for months now. So far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus, but the genetic evidence of H5N1 in milk suggests the outbreak is more widespread.", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_count": 0, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The outbreak has raised concerns among virologists and epidemiologists that the current spread in mammals may allow the bird flu virus to adapt to mammalian physiology, pre-adapting it for sustained spread among humans, which could be catastrophic.", "affirm_why_count": 1, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "Pandemics start slowly—few cases here, a few there—until suddenly people are sick or dying everywhere.", "affirm_keywords_count": 1, "deny_transmissible_statement_2": "If these samples had full virus particles capable of replication, we would have expected to see growth in cells and eggs, which we did not see.", "deny_transmissible_statement_3": "The conclusion is we simply don't think there's any replicating virus in these samples.", "deny_transmissible_count": 2, "deny_why_statement_1": "None of the samples produced viable, replicating virus, Prater said.", "deny_why_statement_2": "Their own study of 58 PCR-positive milk samples taken from Texas, Kansas, and eight other states in the Midwest also failed to turn up any evidence that H5N1 can survive the pasteurization process.", "deny_why_statement_3": "If these samples had full virus particles capable of replication, we would have expected to see growth in cells and eggs, which we did not see.

{"id": "512", "title": "Four reasons to be concerned (but not freak out) about the bird flu", "date": "2024-05-01", "fulltext": "Even as several federal agencies scheduled a Wednesday news conference to explain steps being taken to monitor and contain bird flu in the U.S., public health officials this week said even more vigilance is needed. Now is the time to get ahead of bird flu, a handful of experts said, so we don't end up with another nightmare scenario. 'Every moment we're not preparing for it, is a failure on our part,' said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease specialist and founding director of Boston University's Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases. 'It is always later than we think it is in an outbreak.' Bird flu is the nonscientific name for avian influenza, a type of flu virus that commonly infects waterfowl, turkeys and other birds. If it stays in birds, the main danger is to poultry. Flocks of chickens have had to be killed and eggs destroyed. The larger concern is that it might evolve to become easily transmitted person-to-person. Bird flu is considered more dangerous than the annual flu because it's a strain humans have never encountered and it's likely to be highly contagious. This probably hasn't happened yet, experts say. 'There's no current evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission,' said Dr. Raj Panjabi, a part-time faculty member at Harvard Medical School and the former White House senior director for global health security and biodefense on the United States National Security Council. 'It's the moment to get ready to step up investments in public health, especially around prevention, protection and preparedness,' Panjabi said. Federal officials Wednesday said the latest round of testing proves the commercial milk supply is safe, as are products like cottage cheese and sour cream that are made from milk. They continue to test people who work on farms and only one person is known to have caught the virus in recent months. Vaccines and antivirals should be available if bird flu becomes transmissible from person to person. But public health officials say they suspect more people have caught the virus from animals than we're aware of, and the chance of a bird flu pandemic cannot be ruled out. Bhadelia said the absence of more human infections so far may reflect a lack of testing rather than a lack of actual infections. 'If I were a betting person, I would say there have probably been more human infections than what we've detected already in this country,' she said. 'I would bet part of my retirement on that.' In interviews this week, she and other leading epidemiologists, infectious disease, public policy and dairy industry experts, outlined four major concerns about bird flu, and one area where they feel mostly reassured: It's called 'bird flu' but it's now in cows and other animals What makes the outbreak so concerning is that the bird flu virus already has jumped from birds to other animals, including cows. This form of avian influenza, a strain called H5N1, has been around since at least 1997, but it mutated a few years ago to become adaptable to more kinds of bird species as well as to mammals. Since then, it's been found in a range of animals, including a bottlenose dolphin off the coast of Florida in March 2022 and 29 house cats in Poland in June 2023. But finding it on American cattle farms in early February was still a surprise, said Gerry Parker, associate dean for Global One Health at the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University. Cows are not considered especially vulnerable to flu. A virus that can thrive in a range of mammals might thrive in humans. 'The probability is going up that we might get a genetic reassortment that could turn this into a human virus,' Parker said. 'We don't know that, but as this continues to circulate into more mammalian species, the likelihood just increases. It may never happen but if it did, it could easily become a potential pandemic threat.' Do we really know where it's spread? Bird flu initially struck a single dairy farm in the Texas panhandle and spread to other dairy farms from there, Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer with the Department of Agriculture, told reporters Wednesday. But it's still not clear exactly where the flu virus has spread or what it's capable of, said several experts, including Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. 'Our surveillance is inadequate to know where this virus is and where it isn't, which is critical for protecting farmworkers and people involved in the dairy industry but also important for staying ahead of this virus to prevent a future pandemic,' Nuzzo said. About 100 people working on dairy and cattle farms have been tested for active infections. Nuzzo and others said testing should be more widespread and should also include tests to see whether some had already recovered from infections. 'If there are a lot more people infected who aren't sick enough to go to the hospital, that would be important to know,' Nuzzo said. 'We have to have a much stronger conversation about how to improve our surveillance.' It's also unclear exactly how this virus is being transmitted among animals, which is crucial information for slowing or stopping the spread and protecting people working on farms. Although flu is typically a respiratory virus passed through the air and by touching contaminated surfaces, it has behaved differently among cows; at least some of the transmission appears to be through unpasteurized milk. Farm cats have contracted the virus, potentially by drinking this milk. 'We think milk is the primary vector for movement (of the virus),' Sifford told reporters. Milking equipment is cleaned but not sterilized between cows, Parker said, so the virus may be transmitted when one cow with the virus in her milk leaves some of it on the machine to be picked up by the next cow's udder. The cows also passed it back to birds. Eight poultry flocks located near infected dairy herds contracted the virus after the cows did, though how they got it remains unclear. No one knows how sick a person might get if they catch H5N1. Birds often die; most cows, so far, have recovered from their infections, said Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation. The one farmworker in Texas who caught bird flu only suffered from an eye infection and apparently recovered fully. Bhadelia speculated he might have caught it by touching his eye after touching contaminated milking equipment, which is why the infection was focused on his eye. Since 1997, about half the people hospitalized globally with bird flu have died. But Bhadelia said many more might have caught the virus from direct interactions with infected birds and never showed symptoms or were so mildly ill that they never required treatment so the actual death rate is unknown. Plus, if the virus did adapt to become transmissible in people, it might become milder, though we can't count on that, she said. In any kind of emerging crisis, there's never enough data, Parker said. 'I call it the fog of war,' he said. Workers may not be adequately protected Although the average American is not at risk right from bird flu, farmworkers, especially those working around poultry and cattle, probably are. 'We've been so fixated on, 'Is this going to become a pandemic?' and not enough on 'There's a threat on our farms today,'' Nuzzo said. 'We should not wait for a severe illness in order to protect farmworkers.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended dairy workers and people who come onto dairy farms use eye protection, wash their hands frequently and wear things like disposable coveralls if they travel from farm to farm, so as not to carry the virus with them, Jonker noted. In addition to the basic worries about worker health, the more workers become infected, the greater the risk one of them won't be able to clear the virus quickly. Viruses evolve as they pass from person to person but also within a single person, especially if they don't shake it off quickly, Bhadelia said. 'The more people it infects, and the longer it adapts to the human body,' she said, the more likely the virus will become contagious and dangerous to other people. Yes, there are vaccines and antivirals, but... Unfortunately, even people who've gotten annual flu shots or caught the flu recently won't have any protection against the H5N1 strain, said Lawrence Gostin, a leader in global health at Georgetown University, where he is faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. The federal government has flu vaccine and antiviral stockpiles that theoretically could be useful if H5N1 becomes easily transmissible among people. But public health experts say the reality is much more complicated. There won't be enough for everyone and the vaccine that's been stockpiled hasn't been tested to prove it can effectively prevent infection or severe disease. 'I don't know that anyone has a vaccine that's been tested thoroughly that anyone would be really confident about its effectiveness,' said Dr. Jeremy Luban, a professor at the UMass Chan Medical School and member of the executive committee of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness. 'Part of the problem is we don't actually know what that virus is until it appears.' Two companies are testing a candidate vaccine in early trials, David Boucher, a top official within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, said at the news conference. If the virus moves from animals into people, it will continue to mutate, so existing vaccines might not be effective and it's challenging to develop and test a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist, Luban said. Such testing would take time and the flu virus, which mutates much faster than the virus that causes COVID-19, would continue to transform. Antivirals, like Tamiflu, are likely to be effective against bird flu, federal officials say. But they need to be taken within the first day or two after infection starts, at a time when most people aren't even sure whether they are sick and well before they have time to make a doctor's appointment and get and fulfill a prescription for an antiviral. But the food supply is almost certainly safe. Both public health and federal officials reassured the public about the safety of the commercial food supply. Concerns about bird flu passing through milk is another reason people should avoid drinking unpasteurized milk, Nuzzo said. 'There are a lot of reasons not to drink raw milk,' she said. 'We just added a new one.' The point of pasteurization is to kill pathogens. The Food and Drug Administration has tested 297 commercial samples that had evidence of the H5N1 virus, including 96 milk samples and another 200 products made with milk, like cottage cheese and sour cream. In all cases, the virus had been killed by pasteurization and posed no health risk, said Dr. Donald A. Prater, the FDA's acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The agency also tested infant and toddler formula and found no viral particles at all, Prater told reporters. Surveillance on poultry farms is more extensive than on cattle farms because bird flu has been seen in birds for much longer, Jonker and others said. At the first sign of infection on an egg or chicken farm, animals are 'culled,' a polite way of saying 'killed' and their eggs destroyed. The government long ago set aside funds to compensate farmers for having to take such drastic actions, he said. The meat supply is almost certainly safe, Emilio Esteban USDA's Under Secretary for Food Safety, told reporters. He said animals are inspected before slaughter and carcasses must pass inspection after slaughter. 'We are confident the meat supply is safe,' he said. For extra security, his department is now running tests on retail samples of ground beef purchased from states where dairy herds have been affected by bird flu, along with muscle from cows killed after being infected with bird flu and from beef patties cooked at three different temperatures to document that cooking kills any virus that might remain in the meat. 'We are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe,' he said. 'We are doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure we have additional data points. Sample ready for testing. On April 19, 2022, New York, USA, NYC high school students who work in a virology lab at Mount Sinai collected bird droppings in Central Park.

Thirty-six cattle herds in nine states and one person in Texas tested positive for the H5N1 virus since late March. Federal officials have begun testing related food products after traces of the virus causing bird flu were found in pasteurized milk. At a Wednesday news conference, representatives with the FDA, the CDC and the USDA reassured the public that the commercial food supply is likely safe, but reiterated that people should avoid drinking unpasteurized milk. \"As this situation evolves, the FDA will continue to consider all ongoing scientific research related to the effectiveness of pasteurization for HPAI in bovine milk,\" the FDA said in a related news release Wednesday. \"We are also committed to continued surveillance of milk production, processing and pasteurization to help ensure the safety of the milk supply.\" Experts weigh in: Four reasons to be concerned (but not freak out) about the bird flu What is bird flu? Bird flu is the non-scientific name for avian influenza, a type of flu virus that commonly infects waterfowl, turkeys and other birds. If it stays in birds, the main danger is to poultry. Flocks of chickens have had to be killed and eggs destroyed. The larger concern is that it might evolve to become easily transmitted person-to-person. Bird flu is considered more dangerous than the annual flu because it's a strain humans have never encountered before and it's likely to be highly contagious. This probably hasn't happened yet, experts say. Sour cream and cottage cheese also had bird flu particles The FDA announced it has tested a total of 297 commercial samples of milk products with evidence of the virus, including fluid milk, cottage cheese and sour cream. In all cases, the virus had been killed by pasteurization and so posed no health risk, said Dr. Donald A. Prater, the FDA's acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. FDA says infant and toddler formula free of viral particles The agency also tested infant and toddler formula and found no viral particles at all, Prater told reporters. \"To ensure the safety of milk-derived products for our youngest populations, the FDA also tested samples of retail powdered infant formula and powdered milk products marketed as toddler formula,\" they said. The FDA is also in the process of identifying additional products to be tested. FDA also testing ground beef, but 'confident' it is safe Federal officials already announced they would begin testing ground beef from stores in states with outbreaks of bird flu in dairy cows. While there is no known case of bird flu virus being found in ground beef, samples will be analyzed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service using tests that detect \"whether any viral particles are present,\" the agency said. Two other safety studies will be conducted, as well, because some dairy cows are processed into ground beef when they grow old. The Food Safety and Inspection Service will collect muscle samples from dairy cattle being at slaughter facilities, and those samples will also undergo tests. The agency will do additional testing for live virus on any positive tests from muscle samples and retail ground beef, and do cooking studies of ground beef to determine what temperatures are needed to kill the virus, the USDA says.

In a Wednesday update, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that dairy product testing had found remnants of the virus in one out of five samples but none that contained a live virus capable of transmitting the disease. As long as you consume pasteurized dairy products and cook your poultry products to a proper temperature, your mass-produced products continue to be safe, the agency said. Reports of the virus spreading to other animals outside of birds and cows have left people on edge regardless. Only one case of the virus appearing in a person has been reported despite ongoing testing, said the CDC, and their symptoms were relieved by simple over-the-counter flu medication. However, the current transmission status, according to the CDC, is 'widespread' in wild birds and 'sporadic' in poultry flocks, meaning at-home chicken enthusiasts should consider being extra vigilant when looking after their own flocks. If you keep chickens or other birds, such as waterfowl, on your property, it is best to take some precautions. Here are some tips for keeping your casual flock happy and healthy. Click to view image. What to know: US to test ground beef in states with dairy cows infected with bird flu What is bird flu? Bird flu, also called avian flu, is a contagious infection that spreads among wild birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other animal species. The virus does not usually spread to humans but sporadic infections have been reported. There are several strains all belonging to influenza A-type viruses. The most common subtypes that may affect humans are A (H5N1), A (H7N9) and A (H9N2), according to the Cleveland Clinic. In humans, symptoms can resemble a typical flu but may advance into more serious respiratory symptoms. In birds, avian flu is highly contagious and cases can range in severity from mild to highly deadly. Infected birds shed the viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces, meaning other birds can contract the virus through contact with those fluids directly or via contact with a contaminated surface. Can cats get bird flu: How to protect them and what else to know amid the outbreak How to protect your backyard chicken flock from bird flu The biggest risk to backyard chickens and other small domestic flocks is exposure to wild birds. Domesticated birds may become infected with avian influenza A viruses through direct contact with infected waterfowl or poultry through contact with contaminated surfaces. Some birds, such as ducks, can carry the virus without showing symptoms, meaning it's important to keep your domestic flock secured even if you don't believe there are any sick-looking wild birds around your property. If you keep chickens or other birds on your property, the CDC suggests these basic precautions: * Provide ample enclosures and security to ensure your domestic birds do not come into contact with wild birds and other animals. * Avoid unprotected contact with domestic birds (poultry) that look sick or have died. * Do not touch surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from wild or domestic birds. If you believe a member of your flock may be sick or may have come in contact with an infected animal or contaminated service, extra precautions are required. First, look out for these symptoms of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses: * Sudden death without clinical signs. * Lack of energy and appetite. * Decreased egg production or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs. * Swelling of head, comb, eyelid, wattles, and hocks. * Purple discoloration of wattles, comb, and legs. * Nasal discharge, coughing, and sneezing. * Incoordination. * Diarrhea. If a member of your flock is showing these symptoms or you find dead or ill wild birds on your property, additional precautions need to be put in place to stop the spread. When interacting with sick birds: * Don't touch sick or dead birds, their feces or litter, or any surface or water source (for example, ponds, waterers, buckets, pans, troughs) that might be contaminated with their saliva, feces, or any other bodily fluids without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). * Wear PPE when around sick or dead birds. (Safety goggles that fit snugly, gloves that are disposable, rubber boots or boot covers, an N95 respirator if available, or, if not available, a well-fitting facemask, coveralls that are disposable and fluid-resistant disposable head cover or hair cover.) * Depopulate or separate your chickens from their current housing and perform proper cleaning and sterilization. Separate sick birds from healthy ones. Do not mix birds from a potentially infected flock with those who have not been exposed to the viruses. * As best as possible, during depopulation and while cleaning and disinfecting contaminated premises, avoid stirring up dust and bird waste. * Do not touch your eyes, mouth, or nose or eat when around or in contact with an infected bird or when wearing PPE. * Take PPE off immediately after leaving the affected area and before returning to your home. After use, clean or throw away all PPE that was worn in your coop or poultry environment, or around your birds. Shower after removing it and wash the clothing you wore underneath. * Always wash your hands with soap and water after touching birds, regardless of their health status. * Change all clothing and equipment after interacting with wild or sick birds before contact with healthy domestic poultry and other pet birds. Protecting yourself While bird flu infections in humans are uncommon and unlikely, there are some basic precautions to keep in mind. According to the CDC: * Avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them only from a distance, if possible. * Avoid contact with wild or domestic birds that appear ill or have died and call to report sick or dead birds. * It is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States. Properly handling and cooking poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses. * Seasonal flu vaccination will not prevent infection with bird flu viruses but can reduce the risk of getting sick with human and bird flu viruses at the same time. * People who become sick within 10 days of exposure to infected birds should isolate at home until they are proven not to have bird flu virus infection and have recovered from their illness. The local or state public health department should be notified and can assist in monitoring and advising when isolation is no longer required. Keep an eye out for symptoms of illness in your birds and keep living areas clean.

{"id": "515", "title": "FDA says new bird flu test results show milk supply is safe", "date": "2024-05-01", "fulltext": "Federal regulators announced Wednesday that additional testing of milk and other dairy products sold in grocery stores shows that pasteurization kills a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu—finding they say reaffirms their assessment that the nation's milk supply is safe even as the disease has begun spreading among dairy cattle. Early results from samples including cottage cheese and sour cream did not detect live bird flu virus, Donald A. Prater, acting director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in a press call. 'Findings from the U.S. government partners, as well as academic researchers, do not change our assessment of the safety of the milk supply,' Prater said. Early results last week from an ongoing effort to test 297 samples of retail dairy products from 38 states showed 1 in 5 samples had viral fragments of the H5N1 virus. The presence of genetic fragments of the virus in milk was not unexpected, since the pasteurization process generally does not remove genetic material. Last week's findings prompted researchers to perform a more sensitive test to validate that pasteurization kills H5N1 in milk samples. In those tests, they extracted the viral fragments and tried to grow the virus in fertilized eggs—which is known as the gold-standard method for detecting active, infectious viruses. The virus did not grow, confirming that it was not active. For weeks, key federal agencies have expressed confidence in the safety of the commercial milk supply. The FDA has pointed to data showing that pasteurization inactivates other viruses and that the pasteurization process for eggs—which occurs at a lower temperature than what is used for milk—deactivates the highly pathogenic avian influenza. But experts had called on the agency to back up that claim with new data. The effort to reassure the public that the milk supply is safe underscores the vast unanswered questions about the virus, which has never before been seen in U.S. dairy cattle. A highly virulent bird flu was first detected in cows in Texas and Kansas in late March, and is known to have spread to 36 total herds and seven other states. On April 1, federal officials announced that a dairy worker in Texas was being treated for H5N1, marking only the second human case in the United States. The worker has recovered. Since then, federal agencies and experts have been racing to learn more about how the virus is spreading, when it first jumped to dairy cows and how prevalent H5N1 is in herds. Until this week, testing for the bird flu in dairy herds was voluntary, hindering the country's ability to assess the virus's spread. 'In some ways, we're going to have to catch a break and invest a lot of effort and money if we want to drive H5N1 out of the cattle population now that it's had these months to become established,' said Michael Worobey, a University of Arizona virologist who led a team of scientists who analyzed 239 genetic sequences of the virus. He estimated the bird flu began circulating in dairy cattle some time between November and mid-January. To date, no H5N1 infections have been reported in beef cattle, and the Agriculture Department has received no reports of symptoms in beef herds, Marissa Perry, spokeswoman for the agency, wrote in an email Tuesday. At a scientific symposium on H5N1 hosted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) last week, a top USDA official said beef cattle are at lower risk because they are not kept in as close quarters as dairy cows, which are often kept in more confined spaces and share food and water sources. The USDA has expressed confidence that the meat supply is safe but is seeking to verify this through additional studies that include sampling ground beef at retail stores in the states where dairy cattle have tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu. So far, the outbreak has had minimal impact on international trade. Colombia is the only country known to have put import restrictions on U.S. beef. Epidemiologists and industry experts worry about the virus potentially spreading to more animals. On some of the earliest affected dairy farms in Texas and Kansas, cats also became sick and died after being fed colostrum and milk from affected cows. The USDA began surveillance of wild pigs several months ago; ongoing testing of domestic swine for influenza would also pick up this bird flu strain, chief veterinary officer Rosemary Sifford said at a symposium last week. Industry experts say dairy farmers face economic disincentives to test broadly. Farmers don't want to be known for having an infected herd, which could temporarily decrease milk supply and hurt business. 'It's pretty clear that there's a lot of disincentives working,' said Gerald Parker, an associate dean at the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University and a longtime expert on pandemic preparedness. 'There's no clear policy on the way forward. What happens if there is a positive test [in a cow,] and what are the economic impacts to that given herd or the milk supply in a given region?' Sifford said the USDA is considering compensating milk producers for taking on additional safety measures. Public health experts say there needs to be more testing of the dairy workforce, including farmworkers, truck drivers and people who work in milk-processing plants and slaughterhouses. Health officials have said broader surveillance of workers is challenging. Some farm owners may be reluctant to work with public health officials because of a lack of trust and the legal status of their workforce, Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a briefing last week. Officials say the data they are gathering from this novel outbreak may be changing quickly.

Local authorities have even warned a tsunami could be triggered by 'volcanic material collapsing into the ocean.' Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Campus protests Pro-Palestinian protests continue to rock college campuses across the country, with some teens and parents now reconsidering their enrollment decisions. Students nationwide have only a few days left to submit their college deposits and make their decisions on where to enroll for the fall, and many protests have impacted the logistics of visiting schools. On Wednesday, police deemed the UCLA encampment an unlawful assembly, with officials saying many protesters were unaffiliated with the university. They also ordered people to disperse or face arrest. Law enforcement overnight began pulling aside barricades and making their way back into the UCLA encampment, prompting more tense clashes, according to a CNN team on the ground. 2. Abortion The Arizona Senate on Wednesday voted to repeal the state's 160-year-old near-total abortion ban, three weeks after the state Supreme Court revived the controversial law. The bill next heads to the desk of Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, who said Wednesday that she looks forward 'to quickly signing the repeal into law.' The legislation would clear the way for Arizona's 15-week limit to remain in place. On the same day, Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Florida hours after a ban on most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy went into effect in the state. At a campaign event, she laid out in stark terms what a second Trump administration would mean for women across the country: 'More bans, more suffering, less freedom.' 3. Bird flu Ongoing testing of milk and dairy products by the FDA has not found any active H5N1 bird flu virus in nearly 300 samples of products purchased in grocery stores, the agency said Wednesday. The FDA has tested samples of milk and other kinds of products made from milk, like cheese and sour cream, as well as products made with milk powder, such as infant and toddler formula. This positive news comes as the government is also testing samples of raw and cooked ground beef purchased at grocery stores to evaluate and contain a bird flu outbreak among dairy cows that has spread to about three dozen herds in nine states. The highest concentration of infected cattle is in Texas, where 12 herds have tested positive. 4. Interest rates The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is holding interest rates at their current levels for the sixth straight meeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues previously penciled in three rate cuts this year, but that now looks very much in doubt. Questions had even been raised as to whether the economy is so hot that the Fed may need to hike rates, but Powell dispelled that notion in his post-meeting news conference. He said a persistently strong economy, coupled with inflation continuing to stall, would simply result in the Fed holding off on cutting rates, but added that an 'unexpected weakening in the labor market' could speed up the timing of the first cut. Data shows the job market overall remains robust, with unemployment still under 4% and employers continuing to hire workers at a brisk pace. 5. Electric vehicles Tesla has abruptly fired the team running its electric vehicle charging business, raising doubts about the future of one of the largest US charging networks. A lack of charging infrastructure is one of the main barriers to widespread EV adoption, and Tesla's extensive 'Supercharger' network has long been a major selling point for its vehicles. The move also blindsided other carmakers, such as General Motors and Ford, which planned to use the network. Still, experts say the EV market is not collapsing, but rather entering a new phase in which consumers are demanding more affordable models. Worldwide sales of plug-in vehicles will rise around 20% this year compared to 2023, according to a report from the International Energy Agency.

{"id": "517", "title": "H5N1 bird flu was circulating in dairy cows for four months before it was detected, USDA scientists say", "date": "2024-05-02", "fulltext": "(CNN) — Bird flu was probably circulating in dairy cows for at least four months before it was confirmed to be the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, according to a new analysis of genomic data by scientists at the US Department of Agriculture's Animal Disease Center. The research also found infected cattle that had no apparent connections, suggesting that there are affected herds that have not yet been identified, the study said. It adds to a growing pile of evidence suggesting that the H5N1 virus had a head start in the US dairy industry for months before it came to the attention of scientists and government regulators. The USDA's study was published as a preprint, ahead of peer review, on the BioRXIV server on Wednesday. It follows a similar analysis by an independent international group of almost two dozen evolutionary and molecular biologists who quickly analyzed raw genome sequences uploaded by the government to a server maintained by the National Library of Medicine. Despite the lack of critical background information on those samples, that group came to nearly the same conclusion as the USDA: that the virus had crossed over from wild birds to cows between mid-November and mid-January, which means it was circulating for months before anyone knew. The USDA officially confirmed the presence of the H5N1 virus on March 25 in dairy cows in Texas. Since then, at least three dozen infected herds have been reported across nine states. At least one farmworker who was in contact with infected cows in Texas also tested positive for H5N1, the second human case of this type of flu ever reported in the US. The worker was given antiviral medication and has recovered. Tests of milk from retail stores have shown inert remnants of the virus in about 1 in 5 samples, the US Food and Drug Administration reported last week, suggesting that the infection had become widespread. Further testing by the FDA has confirmed that the virus in the samples of pasteurized dairy products was not active and couldn't make anyone sick, but experts have strongly advised against the consumption of raw milk. We could have done a much better job catching H5N1 in dairy cows, said Dr. Michael Worobey, head of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona who was part of the group of biologists that conducted the independent analysis. Worobey studies how pandemics start. Worobey said that as soon as the cows were noticeably sick with something mysterious, instead of testing for specific viruses and bacteria, ideally, a lab would have used a technique called metagenomic sequencing, which reads all the genetic material in a sample and uses computers to help pick out relevant information. If that had been done, that would have revealed H5N1 in January and then even beyond that, he said. If we're serious about preventing outbreaks in animals that could lead to human pandemics, Worobey said, regulators need to change their approach. We have to get out of the mindset of waiting for that tip of the iceberg of sick animals or sick humans to be noticed. Instead, he said, animals need to be routinely tested with modern techniques for identifying emerging pathogens. The new study gives the USDA's account of how bird flu seemed to spread so quickly to herds across the US. Samples collected between March 7 and April 8 found very similar H5N1 viruses in 26 herds in eight states and six poultry flocks in three states, suggesting that the virus had crossed over in a single spillover event between wild birds and cows. The study says production veterinarians first noticed cows who weren't eating well with changes to their milk production and quality in late January. H5N1 has been devastating wild and domestic bird populations in the US since 2022, and it has infected a growing number of mammals. In addition to the movement between cattle and wild birds, the study found evidence that infected cattle had passed the virus to domestic poultry flocks through multiple transmission routes. The researchers also found that the virus involved in the current outbreak had infected a wild animal — a raccoon — and cats that lived near the cows on dairy farms. Interestingly, the virus sequenced from the infected farmworker had key differences from the cow genomes. The USDA scientists concluded that the differences might mean they were missing samples from the animals the farmworker had come into contact with or could have been due to the evolution of the virus from host to host. Worobey says the study means H5N1 is now seemingly well-entrenched in the dairy cattle population in the country and might be something we have to deal with for years to come.

As the H5N1 strain hops from birds to more than 36 dairy farms in nine states, both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have pressed the Biden administration for quick and clear information on the risks for dairy cows and, potentially, people. But even as new tests show pasteurized milk is safe and agriculture officials impose testing regimens for interstate cattle moves, Republicans have another burgeoning concern—that alarm means harm for the dairy industry. A key goal of monitoring genetic sequences in an outbreak is to track the evolution of a spreading virus, in this case to see if transmission among a new mammalian species is leading to changes that could make H5N1 more transmissible to and among people. Without the equivalent of a time stamp on the individual sequences, that’s much more difficult to do, scientists told STAT. “We know what was happening a month ago, but we don’t know what’s happening now. Or it’s less clear what’s happening now,” said Thomas Peacock, an influenza virologist at the Pirbright Institute, a British organization that focuses on controlling viral illnesses in animals. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy Cows in 36 herds in nine states are known to have tested positive for the virus. But it is widely believed the outbreak, which may have begun late last year, is more widespread than the number of confirmed outbreaks would suggest. Many of the 87 new sequences that were uploaded to the database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information run by the National Institutes of Health’s National Library of Medicine are from samples retrieved from poultry and wild birds, and may not pertain to the dairy cow outbreak. But 10 of the new viral sequences are from cattle, two more are from cats, and another is from a pigeon. These sequences are all believed to be part of the outbreak. The fact that basic information called metadata isn’t being shared about the samples “hinders our efforts a lot,” said Gytis Dudas, a senior researcher in genomic epidemiology and metagenomics at the Vilnius University Life Sciences Center in Lithuania. Dudas is working with a group of U.S. and international researchers to try to make sense of what the genetic sequences say about the H5N1 outbreak in cows. Related: What we’re starting to learn about H5N1 in cows, and the risk to people A number of scientists have openly questioned whether the USDA is deliberately withholding these data, or even removing more specific information. “I can’t imagine that they’d be getting these samples, running the sequences, and not somehow recording that data for themselves, for what state it came from and what date it was sampled. That’s really extremely basic data,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who studies emerging zoonotic pathogens disease threats that jump from animals to humans at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, Canada. A USDA spokesman denied that the department is taking metadata off the sequence files before uploading them. In an email exchange with STAT, he said samples it receives contain only laboratory information numbers when they are sequenced. “Metadata is added by [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] staff after the sequencing occurs,” he said. “APHIS adds ‘USA’ and ‘2024’ as metadata tags and posts the sequences as they become available, in order to expedite public access to sequence data.” Related: Watch: What we know about traces of H5N1 bird flu found in pasteurized milk The department has committed to sharing raw sequence data as quickly as it is available and has said it will upload what are called “consensus sequences” in an internationally used database, GISAID the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data when they are ready. Consensus sequences are more thoroughly edited and contain the metadata scientists are seeking. It’s not just academic scientists who are seeking it, Peacock said, noting international public health agencies that are trying to assess the risk the U.S. outbreak poses are keen to get more data too. “They’re just being much more quiet about it. But you know they’re all requesting this and not getting it as well, as far as I’m aware.” The USDA has only posted consensus sequences to GISAID from this outbreak once, in late March. It’s clear, though, that they have many more than they have shared to date. At an online symposium last week, Rosemary Sifford, the USDA’s chief veterinary officer, showed a phylogenetic tree featuring dozens of sequences, using the figure to explain that the department believes the outbreaks across the country are all linked and began from one spillover of the virus from wild birds to cows, likely in Texas. USDA Chief Veterinary Officer Rosemary Sifford presented a phylogenetic tree of H5N1 viruses from the dairy cow outbreak during a recent online symposium.

{"id": "520", "title": "Bird flu virus circulated in cows for four months before outbreak confirmed by USDA, analysis shows", "date": "2024-05-02", "fulltext": "As agricultural authorities and epidemiologists try to get their arms around the scope of the latest confounding chapter in the decades-long story of the H5N1 avian influenza virus—its jump into U.S. herds of dairy cattle—they’re turning to the genetic breadcrumbs the virus leaves behind in the animals’ nose, lungs, and, primarily, milk. On Wednesday, U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists released a preprint—a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed—describing for the first time what their investigations of 220 viral genomes from infected cows have so far turned up. The study’s authors suggest that the spread in cattle started from a single spillover event from birds in the Texas panhandle that may have happened in early December. The USDA didn’t confirm the presence of H5N1 in a Texas herd until March 25. “These data support a single introduction event from wild bird origin virus into cattle, likely followed by limited local circulation for approximately 4 months prior to confirmation by USDA,” the authors wrote. The findings add more precision to what had previously been reported by academic scientists. Reading viral genomes can provide clues to the origins of the outbreak and allows researchers to monitor how the virus, which primarily infects wild and farmed birds, is changing as it finds a foothold in bovine hosts. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Enter your email Privacy Policy In an initial analysis of USDA genome sequence data released last week, academic DNA sleuths had revealed that the outbreak in dairy cows has likely been going on for months longer than previously realized, and has probably spread more widely than official numbers would suggest. So far, the USDA has reported 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus. The new analysis also offers a window into how the bird flu is changing as it spends time in the bodies of cattle. In the last few years, H5N1 has spread from wild birds to a variety of carnivorous mammals, including foxes, bears, and seals, but in each of those instances, the virus has hit a dead end. The outbreak in dairy cows represents one of the first times that this bird flu virus has demonstrated the ability to efficiently transmit between mammals, said Thomas Mettenleiter, a virologist who served as the director of the Friedrich Loeffler Institut, Germany’s leading animal disease research center from 1996 until he stepped down last year. The other instance was a number of outbreaks at mink farms in Spain and Finland in 2022 and 2023, respectively. “These spillover events don’t usually lead to transmission chains,” he said. “This situation is definitely an eye-opener for me.” Related: Tracking bird flu virus changes in cows is stymied by missing data, scientists say The USDA’s analysis found about two dozen mutations that have arisen in the H5N1 virus as it has circulated in dairy cattle that are known to make influenza viruses more deadly or more likely to be able to infect humans. “It’s still really difficult to draw a risk map out of that, but there seems to be ongoing evolution,” Mettenleiter said. “This is not surprising but it’s good to know. All these mammal-to-mammal passages, as we would do experimentally, put an evolutionary pressure on the virus to mutate and this is what we see with the increase of these known mammalian adaptation markers.” Vivien Dugan, director of the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told STAT Thursday that the mutations found so far did not raise any immediate red flags for increased risk to human health. “I think based on our analysis of the consensus and some of that raw [sequence] data because we have a good data-sharing relationship with USDA we’ve not seen anything that would be concerning to us for mammalian adaptation, at this point,” Dugan said. The CDC has been testing existing H5 vaccines in ferrets, and found that vaccination appears to offer cross-protection against the virus from the man who was infected in Texas. Related: Republicans, concerned about dairy industry, urge calm about H5N1 bird flu Scientists who have been frustrated by the slow drip of data from the USDA’s investigations hailed the preprint on social media as progress. “Really grateful to this research team for sharing this, though I hope they weren’t holding on to the data solely to ensure they published first,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who studies pathogens that jump from animals to people at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, Canada, posted on X on Thursday. For weeks, the agency has been facing criticism from scientists and pandemic experts for a lack of transparency and timely sharing of data about the outbreak that has slowed down efforts to track its progress. When the USDA finally uploaded a large tranche of genetic sequences of the pathogen to a public database, researchers eager to analyze the sequences to determine if the H5N1 virus has been changing as it is transmitted from cow to cow quickly discovered that the sequences didn’t include necessary information about when and where the samples were collected. All are simply labeled with “USA” and “2024.” The USDA has denied taking that basic information called metadata off the sequence files.

{"id": "521", "title": "Vigilance urged to keep bird flu at bay; 'Staying ahead' could help prevent pandemic", "date": "2024-05-02", "fulltext": "Even as several federal agencies scheduled a Wednesday news conference to explain steps being taken to monitor and contain bird flu in the U.S., public health officials this week said even more vigilance is needed. Now is the time to get ahead of bird flu, a handful of experts said, so we don't end up with another nightmare scenario. 'Every moment we're not preparing for it, is a failure on our part,' said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease specialist and founding director of Boston University's Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases. 'It is always later than we think it is in an outbreak.' Bird flu is the nonscientific name for avian influenza, a type of flu virus that commonly infects waterfowl, turkeys and other birds. If it stays in birds, the main danger is to poultry. Flocks of chickens have had to be killed and eggs destroyed. The larger concern is that it might evolve to become easily transmitted person-to-person. Bird flu is considered more dangerous than the annual flu because it's a strain humans have never encountered and it's likely to be highly contagious. This probably hasn't happened yet, experts say. 'There's no current evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission,' said Dr. Raj Panjabi, a part-time faculty member at Harvard Medical School and the former White House senior director for global health security and biodefense on the United States National Security Council. 'It's the moment to get ready to step up investments in public health, especially around prevention, protection and preparedness,' Panjabi said. Federal officials Wednesday said the latest round of testing proves the commercial milk supply is safe, as are products like cottage cheese and sour cream that are made from milk. They continue to test people who work on farms and only one person is known to have caught the virus in recent months. Vaccines and antivirals should be available if bird flu becomes transmissible from person to person. But public health officials say they suspect more people have caught the virus from animals than we're aware of, and the chance of a bird flu pandemic cannot be ruled out. Bhadelia said the absence of more human infections so far may reflect a lack of testing rather than a lack of actual infections. 'If I were a betting person, I would say there have probably been more human infections than what we've detected already in this country,' she said. 'I would bet part of my retirement on that.' In interviews this week, she and other leading epidemiologists, infectious disease, public policy and dairy industry experts, outlined four major concerns about bird flu, and one area where they feel mostly reassured: It's called 'bird flu' but it's now in cows and other animals What makes the outbreak so concerning is that the bird flu virus already has jumped from birds to other animals, including cows. This form of avian influenza, a strain called H5N1, has been around since at least 1997, but it mutated a few years ago to become adaptable to more kinds of bird species as well as to mammals. Since then, it's been found in a range of animals, including a bottlenose dolphin off the coast of Florida in March 2022 and 29 house cats in Poland in June 2023. But finding it on American cattle farms in early February was still a surprise, said Gerry Parker, associate dean for Global One Health at the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University. Cows are not considered especially vulnerable to flu. A virus that can thrive in a range of mammals might thrive in humans. 'The probability is going up that we might get a genetic reassortment that could turn this into a human virus,' Parker said. 'We don't know that, but as this continues to circulate into more mammalian species, the likelihood just increases. It may never happen but if it did, it could easily become a potential pandemic threat.' Do we really know where it's spread or what's next? Bird flu initially struck a single dairy farm in the Texas panhandle and spread to other dairy farms from there, Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer with the Department of Agriculture, told reporters Wednesday. But it's still not clear exactly where the flu virus has spread or what it's capable of, said several experts, including Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. 'Our surveillance is inadequate to know where this virus is and where it isn't, which is critical for protecting farmworkers and people involved in the dairy industry but also important for staying ahead of this virus to prevent a future pandemic,' Nuzzo said. About 100 people working on dairy and cattle farms have been tested for active infections. Nuzzo and others said testing should be more widespread and should also include tests to see whether some had already recovered from infections. 'If there are a lot more people infected who aren't sick enough to go to the hospital, that would be important to know,' Nuzzo said. 'We have to have a much stronger conversation about how to improve our surveillance.' It's also unclear exactly how this virus is being transmitted among animals, which is crucial information for slowing or stopping the spread and protecting people working on farms. Although flu is typically a respiratory virus passed through the air and by touching contaminated surfaces, it has behaved differently among cows; at least some of the transmission appears to be through unpasteurized milk. Farm cats have contracted the virus, potentially by drinking this milk. 'We think milk is the primary vector for movement (of the virus),' Sifford told reporters. Milking equipment is cleaned but not sterilized between cows, Parker said, so the virus may be transmitted when one cow with the virus in her milk leaves some of it on the machine to be picked up by the next cow's udder. The cows also passed it back to birds. Eight poultry flocks located near infected dairy herds contracted the virus after the cows did, though how they got it remains unclear. No one knows how sick a person might get if they catch H5N1. Birds often die; most cows, so far, have recovered from their infections, said Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation. The one farmworker in Texas who caught bird flu only suffered from an eye infection and apparently recovered fully. Bhadelia speculated he might have caught it by touching his eye after touching contaminated milking equipment, which is why the infection was focused on his eye. Since 1997, about half the people hospitalized globally with bird flu have died. But Bhadelia said many more might have caught the virus from direct interactions with infected birds and never showed symptoms or were so mildly ill that they never required treatment so the actual death rate is unknown. Plus, if the virus did adapt to become transmissible in people, it might become milder, though we can't count on that, she said. In any kind of emerging crisis, there's never enough data, Parker said. 'I call it the fog of war,' he said. Farmworkers may not be adequately protected Although the average American is not at risk right from bird flu, farmworkers, especially those working around poultry and cattle, probably are. 'We've been so fixated on, 'Is this going to become a pandemic?' and not enough on 'There's a threat on our farms today,'' Nuzzo said. 'We should not wait for a severe illness in order to protect farmworkers.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended dairy workers and people who come onto dairy farms use eye protection, wash their hands frequently and wear things like disposable coveralls if they travel from farm to farm, so as not to carry the virus with them, Jonker noted. In addition to the basic worries about worker health, the more workers become infected, the greater the risk one of them won't be able to clear the virus quickly. Viruses evolve as they pass from person to person but also within a single person, especially if they don't shake it off quickly, Bhadelia said. 'The more people it infects, and the longer it adapts to the human body,' she said, the more likely the virus will become contagious and dangerous to other people. Yes, vaccines and antivirals are available to the public, but... Unfortunately, even people who've gotten annual flu shots or caught the flu recently won't have any protection against the H5N1 strain, said Lawrence Gostin, a leader in global health at Georgetown University, where he is faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. The federal government has flu vaccine and antiviral stockpiles that theoretically could be useful if H5N1 becomes easily transmissible among people. But public health experts say the reality is much more complicated. There won't be enough for everyone and the vaccine that's been stockpiled hasn't been tested to prove it can effectively prevent infection or severe disease. 'I don't know that anyone has a vaccine that's been tested thoroughly that anyone would be really confident about its effectiveness,' said Dr. Jeremy Luban, a professor at the UMass Chan Medical School and member of the executive committee of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness. 'Part of the problem is we don't actually know what that virus is until it appears.' Two companies are testing a candidate vaccine in early trials, David Boucher, a top official within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, said at the news conference. If the virus moves from animals into people, it will continue to mutate, so existing vaccines might not be effective and it's challenging to develop and test a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist, Luban said. Such testing would take time and the flu virus, which mutates much faster than the virus that causes COVID-19, would continue to transform. Antivirals, like Tamiflu, are likely to be effective against bird flu, federal officials say. But they need to be taken within the first day or two after infection starts, at a time when most people aren't even sure whether they are sick and well before they have time to make a doctor's appointment and get and fulfill a prescription for an antiviral. But the food supply is almost certainly safe, officials say. Both public health and federal officials reassured the public about the safety of the commercial food supply. Concerns about bird flu passing through milk is another reason people should avoid drinking unpasteurized milk, Nuzzo said. 'There are a lot of reasons not to drink raw milk,' she said. 'We just added a new one.' The point of pasteurization is to kill pathogens. The Food and Drug Administration has tested 297 commercial samples that had evidence of the H5N1 virus, including 96 milk samples and another 200 products made with milk, like cottage cheese and sour cream. In all cases, the virus had been killed by pasteurization and posed no health risk, said Dr. Donald A. Prater, the FDA's acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The agency also tested infant and toddler formula and found no viral particles at all, Prater told reporters. Surveillance on poultry farms is more extensive than on cattle farms because bird flu has been seen in birds for much longer, Jonker and others said. At the first sign of infection on an egg or chicken farm, animals are 'culled,' a polite way of saying 'killed' and their eggs destroyed. The government long ago set aside funds to compensate farmers for having to take such drastic actions, he said. The meat supply is almost certainly safe, Emilio Esteban USDA's Under Secretary for Food Safety, told reporters. He said animals are inspected before slaughter and carcasses must pass inspection after slaughter. 'We are confident the meat supply is safe,' he said. For extra security, his department is now running tests on retail samples of ground beef purchased from states where dairy herds have been affected by bird flu, along with muscle from cows killed after being infected with bird flu and from beef patties cooked at three different temperatures to document that cooking kills any virus that might remain in the meat. 'We are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe,' he said. 'We are doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure we have additional data points.

At UCLA: Police used stun grenades and leveled tents. Tensions are high a day after counterprotesters violently attacked the school's pro-Palestinian encampment. In Congress: The House passed a bill yesterday to expand the definition of antisemitism to include certain criticism of Israel. Critics say it violates the First Amendment. 2 The Arizona Senate voted yesterday to repeal the state's 1864 abortion ban. What to know: The strict Civil War-era ban was revived last month by a state Supreme Court decision, leading to a national backlash. The governor may sign the repeal into law today. But it's not over yet: The ban is still on track to temporarily take effect in June because of procedural issues. In November, Arizona voters may decide whether to enshrine abortion rights. 3 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said yesterday she'll try to oust the House Speaker. Why? The far-right Georgia Republican is angry that Mike Johnson (R.-La.) relied on Democrats to pass key bills. She'll force a vote to remove him next week. Will she succeed? It's not looking likely. Only a few other Republicans publicly back her. Democrats may block it. And Trump is reportedly not supportive. 4 Harvey Weinstein will have a retrial in his New York rape case. What to know: The disgraced 72-year-old former film producer's 2020 conviction for rape was overturned last week by New York's highest court, which found his trial was unfair. Zooming out: The case will be retried after Labor Day, a judge said yesterday. He remains in prison for a separate rape conviction. His accusers launched the #MeToo movement in 2017. 5 The FDA said new tests for bird flu showed the milk supply is safe. What it found: Pasteurization kills a highly infectious strain of bird flu found in grocery store milk and dairy, the agency announced yesterday. That means it's safe to consume. The bigger picture: Tests revealed last week that 1 in 5 samples of grocery store milk had fragments of the virus. The disease has been spreading among dairy cattle. 6 A new study is reassuring about the safety of menopause hormone drugs. The background: In 2002, a landmark study linked drugs used to alleviate menopause symptoms to increased risk of disease, causing millions to abandon them. What's new? A long-term follow-up, published yesterday, suggests those fears were overblown and the drugs are relatively safe for short-term treatment in women under 60. 7 A cat shipped herself 630 miles in a box and lived to tell the tale.

{"id": "523", "title": "The Checkup With Dr. Wen: Answering reader questions about bird flu", "date": "2024-05-02", "fulltext": "You're reading The Checkup With Dr. Wen, a newsletter on how to navigate covid-19 and other public health challenges. Click here to get the full newsletter in your inbox, including answers to reader questions and a summary of new scientific research. The Food and Drug Administration last week released some alarming results about the bird flu epidemic spreading among dairy cows. It found that 1 in 5 samples taken from the commercial milk supply contained influenza viral fragments. While this suggests that bird flu is far more widespread among cattle than previously thought, there is no reason to stop consuming milk. My recommendations from two weeks ago have not changed: Most Americans should not worry about the risk of bird flu to their health and do not need to change their behaviors at this time. Many readers had questions specifically about the risks of drinking milk. Anne from Virginia wrote that she has three young children. 'I am not worried about myself so much, but I worry about my kids. They drink milk during breakfast and with dinner. Should I switch them to almond or soy milk?' Nancy from Pennsylvania similarly wants to know if other dairy projects such as cheese and yogurt are safe. 'I include dairy in my diet to keep bones strong. Do you recommend using other calcium sources instead?' I also drink a large glass of milk every morning, and both my kids have at least two glasses a day. I am not changing our milk consumption and do not advise Anne or Nancy to do so, either. That's because commercially available milk is pasteurized. This is a process in which the milk is heated to a high temperature for a set time to kill bacteria and viruses. Multiple studies have shown that it is effective in killing influenza viruses. Preliminary results confirm that pasteurization inactivates the avian H5N1 strains driving the outbreak, and the FDA has affirmed that the commercial milk supply is safe. This means that cheese and yogurt made from pasteurized milk are safe, too. People should refrain from consuming unpasteurized milk products, which can carry other microbes that cause foodborne illnesses, such as salmonella, E. coli and listeria. It is also not known whether drinking raw milk could transmit avian flu. 'What about infant formula?' Darcy from Michigan inquired. 'A lot of infant formula uses cow's milk. Are we going to have another infant formula shortage?' The FDA has tested several samples of retail powdered infant formula and found no avian flu virus fragments. Even if fragments are found in the future, the guidance will probably be unchanged, as commercially sold formula also goes through strict sterilization procedures. As a result, I don't think we will see an infant formula shortage due to avian flu, though, as my colleague Alyssa Rosenberg reminds us, there are steps lawmakers should take to ensure that the crisis that occurred in 2022 does not repeat itself. Of course, just because milk remains safe to drink doesn't mean avian flu isn't a potential threat to human health. I was honored to learn historian John M. Barry, author of the seminal book on the 1918 influenza pandemic, is a Checkup reader. He emailed me to express his worries, and I took him up on the offer to speak by phone. 'The question is, are we in the early stages of watching the evolution of this virus toward something that will become respiratory and spread through the aerosols between mammals and humans?' he said. 'It's too early to say that that's happening, but there are some things that are disconcerting.' Indeed, while the spread of H5N1 from birds to mammals has long been documented, we have not previously observed this scale of outbreak among mammals. Health officials do not know how cows are spreading the virus to one another and whether there could be asymptomatic transmission. And there are concerns that some farms might not cooperate with federal guidance to test and isolate affected cows. Barry reminds us that 'virtually nothing' is known about how the 1918 influenza jumped species or how long these evolutionary changes took to occur. And even if we did know these details, it would be unwise to expect avian flu to follow the same playbook. All that said, we should keep in mind that there are not yet any instances of human-to-human transmission during this avian flu outbreak. And I remain reassured that federal health officials have a plan for manufacturing and distributing treatment and vaccines, should bird flu become the next pandemic.", "media_outlet": "WaPo", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "'The question is, are we in the early stages of watching the evolution of this virus toward something that will become respiratory and spread through the aerosols between mammals and humans?' he said.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_6": "And I remain reassured that federal health officials have a plan for manufacturing and distributing treatment and vaccines, should bird flu become the next pandemic.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 2, "affirm_why_statement_1": "'The question is, are we in the early stages of watching the evolution of this virus toward something that will become respiratory and spread through the aerosols between mammals and humans?' he said.

{"id": "524", "title": "New Mutations Identified in Bird Flu Virus: A genetic analysis sheds light on when the outbreak began, how the virus spread and where it may be going.", "date": "2024-05-03", "fulltext": "The bird flu virus sweeping across dairy farms in multiple states has acquired dozens of new mutations, including some that may make it more adept at spreading between species and less susceptible to antiviral drugs, according to a new study. None of the mutations is a cause for alarm on its own. But they underscore the possibility that as the outbreak continues, the virus may evolve in ways that would allow it to spread easily between people, experts said. The virus, called H5N1, has infected cows in at least 36 herds in nine states, raising fears that milk could be infectious—concerns now largely put to rest—and highlighting the risk that many viruses might jump across species on crowded farms. The study was posted online on Wednesday and has not been peer reviewed. It is among the first to provide details of a Department of Agriculture investigation that has been mostly opaque until now, frustrating experts outside the government. The outbreak most likely began about four months before it was confirmed in late March, and spread undetected through cows that had no visible symptoms, the researchers found. That timing is consistent with estimates from genetic analyses by other scientists. The virus has been detected in some dairy herds with no known links to affected farms, the authors said, supporting the idea of transmission from cows without symptoms and suggesting there may be infected herds that have not yet been identified. The widespread nature of the outbreak also suggests efficient spread among the cows, according to the new paper. That may pose significant risks to the people who interact closely with those animals. In the new study, the researchers collected samples containing virus from 26 dairy farms in eight states. Cows are not typically susceptible to this type of influenza, but H5N1 appears to have acquired mutations in late 2023 that allowed it to jump from wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle, the researchers said. The virus then appears to have spread on dairy farms from Texas to Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico. In at least a dozen instances since then, H5N1 has also spilled from cows back into wild birds, and into poultry, domestic cats and a raccoon. The findings should prompt large-scale surveillance not just of affected farms but also those without reported infections, said Dr. Diego Diel, a virologist at Cornell and an author of the study. Many of the other species were probably infected after coming into contact with contaminated milk, which can contain very high levels of the virus, Dr. Diel said. A separate study published earlier this week reported that about a dozen cats that were fed raw milk had died. It is not uncommon for dairies to dump discarded milk into manure pits or lagoons. That could definitely serve as a source of infection to other susceptible species, he said. Researchers are closely monitoring H5N1 genetic sequences from cows for mutations that would allow the virus to infect or spread among mammals, including humans, more easily. The only person to have been diagnosed with bird flu during the current outbreak carried a virus with a mutation that allowed it to infect people more efficiently. One cow in the study also carried H5N1 with that mutation. More than 200 others were infected with versions of the virus bearing a different mutation that offers the same advantage. Veterinarians began observing unexplained drops in milk production in cows in late January and sent samples in for testing. The Department of Agriculture did not confirm infections until March 25. The more widespread H5N1 becomes, the more chance there is that it could hit upon a combination of mutations that could increase its risk to humans, said Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. On the other hand, H5N1 has been circulating in various species and causing sporadic human infections for over two decades, and so far we haven't had a pandemic, he said.

{"id": "525", "title": "What a US farmworker's case of bird flu tells us about tracking the infection", "date": "2024-05-03", "fulltext": "(CNN) — A US farmworker who caught bird flu after working with dairy cattle in Texas appears to be the first known case of mammal-to-human transmission of the virus, a new study shows. The dairy worker sought care in late March after developing painful red, swollen, weeping eyes with burst blood vessels. He had no fever, however, and his lungs were clear, according to a letter about the case that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday. He reported no contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but he did have repeated direct close contact with dairy cows in the same part of the state with other infected herds. Even though the man didn't become seriously ill, his case is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows. At the same time, it also leaves critical questions unanswered about a virus that the study authors said has \"pandemic potential,\" and it illustrates how hard it will be to track the infection in this vulnerable population of workers, where testing positive for an infectious disease might mean losing days of work and pay. \"For farmworkers specifically, certainly these are folks that are that are living in a state of economic desperation, and what they're not going to do is, they're not going to test for something if they don't have paid sick leave, because they cannot afford to be sent home and told to stay home and not work,\" said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers. Strater says UFW, like other groups, has heard rumors that there are dairy workers who are sick but don't want to be tested, but she said it's nothing that they're able to confirm. Health officials in Texas said they did test other sick dairy workers, including some with red eyes, but they turned out to have other illnesses, not bird flu. \"The people tested volunteered to be tested,\" said Lara Anton, senior press officer with the Texas Department of State Health Services. \"It's likely there were other people with symptoms who did not want to be tested so we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1. We can say for sure some of the people on dairy farms tested positive for other respiratory viruses that are commonly circulating in the human population,\" Anton said. In the case of the man who did test positive for bird flu, he took antiviral medications and recovered without any lasting problems, and his close family members received the drugs as a precaution, the letter says. Swabs of the patient's eyes and lungs revealed something interesting, too: His eyes were teeming with the H5N1 virus, but there was hardly any virus in his lungs. That could mean the worker was infected through his eyes — either by rubbing them with contaminated hands or through splashes of contaminated milk — rather than through his lungs, and the virus never migrated there, or that the virus couldn't get a foothold in his lungs because it was adapted primarily to infect birds, not cells in the human airway. The letter on the case was written by researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with doctors at the Texas Department of State Health Services and researchers at the Texas Tech Bioterrorism Response Laboratory. Health officials said they couldn't do further investigation of how the man was infected because \"epidemiological investigations were not able to be conducted at the farm\" where he worked. They were also unable to test other workers at the same farm. That kind of testing is critical to answer questions about how the worker became infected, whether others were being infected and if so, for how long they were infected and what kind of symptoms they had, if they had any at all. The CDC is looking for farms that will allow it to conduct such a detailed study. \"Understanding the current avian flu outbreak among dairy cattle is a vital priority to help protect human health,\" the agency said in a statement to CNN. \"Discussions are under way with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies. In the meantime, states continue to test symptomatic farm workers and monitor those who have been exposed to infected animals. CDC also continues to closely monitor a robust, nationwide flu surveillance system. To date, it has not detected any unusual flu activity.\" At a news briefing Friday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration was monitoring the situation \"very closely and taking this very seriously.\"", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "Even though the man didn't become seriously ill, his case is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows.", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "At the same time, it also leaves critical questions unanswered about a virus that the study authors said has 'pandemic potential,' and it illustrates how hard it will be to track the infection in this vulnerable population of workers, where testing positive for an infectious disease might mean losing days of work and pay.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 2, "affirm_why_statement_1": "The case is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "The virus has 'pandemic potential,' according to the study authors.", "affirm_why_statement_3": "The virus could mean the worker was infected through his eyes — either by rubbing them with contaminated hands or through splashes of contaminated milk — rather than through his lungs, and the virus never migrated there, or that the virus couldn't get a foothold in his lungs because it was adapted primarily to infect birds, not cells in the human airway.", "affirm_why_statement_4": "Understanding the current avian flu outbreak among dairy cattle is a vital priority to help protect human health.", "affirm_why_count": 4, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "At the same time, it also leaves critical questions unanswered about a virus that the study authors said has \"pandemic potential,\" and it illustrates how hard it will be to track the infection in this vulnerable population of workers, where testing positive for an infectious disease might mean losing days of work and pay.", "affirm_keywords_count": 1, "deny_transmissible_statement_1": "That could mean the worker was infected through his eyes — either by rubbing them with contaminated hands or through splashes of contaminated milk — rather than through his lungs, and the virus never migrated there, or that the virus couldn't get a foothold in his lungs because it was adapted primarily to infect birds, not cells in the human airway.", "deny_transmissible_count": 1, "deny_why_statement_1": "Swabs of the patient's eyes and lungs revealed something interesting, too: His eyes were teeming with the H5N1 virus, but there was hardly any virus in his lungs.

{"id": "526", "title": "CDC� top flu scientist says the risk to the public from H5N1 is low, but she isn� sleeping well. Here� why", "date": "2024-05-03", "fulltext": "Vivien Dugan isn't getting much sleep these days. The director of the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dugan is leading the team of CDC scientists that is working with partners in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and state and local health departments to respond to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle. The response has been pedal to the metal since the USDA announced on March 25 that a strange illness that had been affecting milk production in some herds since early this year was caused by bird flu. Since then, 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus. Assessing the risk from the situation and messaging it to the public is a balancing act, she admitted. While workers on affected dairy farms are being exposed to the virus one has tested positive so far for the individual American elsewhere, the risk is low, for the moment. Demetre Daskalakis, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in which the flu division is housed said Wednesday that 25 people have been tested for H5N1 in the context of this outbreak, and over 100 people have been monitored for symptoms because they were believed to have been exposed. Related: Republicans, concerned about dairy industry, urge calm about H5N1 bird flu The responding agencies have long experience working with poultry farmers, who've been plagued by this virus for the past couple of years. But its move into cattle has been like crossing into a new country for the agencies. Dairy farmers have no experience with bird flu. Many farmers and farm workers haven't been eager to cooperate with authorities. In an ideal world, blood samples from people who had contact with the infected farm worker would have been studied to look for H5N1 antibodies to see if he transmitted the virus to anyone, a technique called a serology study. But Dugan said she believes that the people involved wouldn't grant permission. STAT asked Dugan about the work the CDC is doing, the complaints from scientists globally about the amount of information the United States has been sharing, and where the needle on her H5N1 risk meter sits right now. As we spoke, a colorful statue of a rooster was visible on a credenza behind her apt decor for a flu researcher. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. The numbers of people tested and/or monitored seems to be implausibly low, given the numbers of workers who would have been exposed to the infected animals. How hard is the U.S. looking for cases? Portrait of Vivien Dugan. -- infectious disease coverage from STAT Vivien Dugan, director of the CDC’s influenza division. CDC We had a team pretty much ready to go six weeks ago, when this first really started to show up on our radar. But this is not the average poultry-worker response situation. These are dairy farms. The poultry space and poultry industry, they've been responding to H5 for the past 2 ½ years, really. There've been more than 8,000 people that have been monitored for symptoms in the H5 poultry space. It’s a different environment altogether when we’re talking about dairy cattle and dairy farms. That said, we are really thinking about how we would go about doing the investigation we would normally do for a novel flu case where they’re all nationally notifiable infections in people in a way that makes scientific and epidemiological sense. The states are really focusing on that, really trying to get as much information as they can. So it’s really more in that local space. We’re supporting them in that effort. Some states have been able to contact workers directly and actively monitor. Others, of course, have not been as successful. Related: From sewage to safety: Hospital wastewater surveillance as a beacon for defense against H5N1 bird flu So it’s a work in progress. We have a couple of potential locations that we’re trying to do more with in getting the logistics sorted out. But no studies have been completed yet. No studies have been completed yet. Have any studies started? That’s probably a good question for some of the impacted states. We don’t want to get ahead of them for any work they may be doing that we don’t have all the details on. It sounds like your team that was ready to go didn’t go. And it sounds like from what you’re telling me that CDC is very much in the back seat on this one. That it’s the states or local authorities who are running this. They have the authority, right? CDC does not have the authority to go into a state. We have to have an invite from state public health. Have any states invited CDC in? No. Not officially yet. We’re speaking to these partners if not once a day, more than that. There are a lot of sensitivities. There are a lot of things that we as public health officials may not be aware of in thinking about dairy farms. We’re used to working with poultry farms and poultry workers where they’re culling all the birds. These cows are not being culled. So it’s a very different space. Related: What we’re starting to learn about H5N1 in cows, and the risk to people We’re working very closely with the state public health partners, where potentially they might be a lead of a study. And we would be in the background supporting. Sometimes we don’t need to deploy a team, we can equip our state public health partners to do the information gathering and work collaboratively with them to do that. There has been a single human case in Texas. Has anybody done serology testing around that individual? That would be an obvious place to start, would it not? I don’t know that that was consented to. You have to have consent from people to follow up. Certainly it was something that was on our radar for what we would like to have and request, but to my knowledge, serology was not performed. The scientific world has been watching H5 for a long time. CDC has been very involved in that. And whenever there have been unusual outbreaks, this country has always pushed for rapid case finding and data sharing. I’m hearing from people outside the United States that when the shoe is on the other foot, when the outbreak is here, they’re not seeing the information sharing that they would hope for, or even evidence that the work that is crucial to finding out whether or not this could get seeded into the human population is happening. Do you have any response to that? It’s a complicated situation as far as [there are] new partners and new individuals and a different group of farm workers. We’re doing everything we can and thinking about messaging, multilingual messages, communications, PPE [personal protective equipment], biosecurity on farms, and collaboration with USDA to really protect workers. That is definitely one of our highest priorities, and it always is. But also we’re really thinking about this in the medium and longer term of what allowing a virus to circulate within a new mammalian host could mean. I don’t think anybody really can predict what might happen, but we certainly know flu viruses change. And we do not want to give the virus that opportunity, if we can avoid it. By the way, I think you need to add to your statue collection. The chicken needs a cow. Yeah. On data sharing, we are trying to be as forthcoming and as transparent as we can with the data that we have. I think we’re doing that in the Spotlights that we’re putting out every Friday. We got the Texas human virus sequence out as quickly as we could. So I think we’re trying to do that as much as we can. We can always do more. But a lot of this, again, is our partnerships with the states. We defer to them. We have to be behind the scenes and let them talk about what’s going on in their state. Can I ask about your personal read on the risk here? If this virus gets seeded into the cow population and it evolves in cows, what do you think this does to the human risk from H5N1? [Dugan grimaced.] I think it would definitely impact the risk, for sure. Our current assessment of the risk to the general public health is low. That could change. And so I think we’re remaining very vigilant if anything, more vigilant in this space. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy These viruses change.

{"id": "527", "title": "Texas dairy farm worker� case may be first where bird flu virus spread from mammal to human, scientists say", "date": "2024-05-03", "fulltext": "A new report on the first human bird flu case tied to the outbreak in cows in the United States suggests that the Texas man may be the first detected case of the H5N1 virus transmitting from a mammal to a person. Nearly 900 people in 23 countries have been infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus since it started spreading from Southeast Asia in late 2003. But previous human cases were all linked to transmission from infected birds, typically domestic poultry. The report, published Friday by the New England Journal of Medicine, details the unidentified man’s symptoms and his possible route of infection. It was written by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Texas Department of State Health Services, and the Texas Tech University Bioterrorism Response Laboratory in Lubbock. How the man became infected cannot be proven; while the cattle on the farm where he worked reportedly suffered from a decline in milk and other symptoms seen in herds that have tested positive for H5N1, no animal testing at that farm was undertaken. The authors noted, though, that nearby farms where dairy cows experienced the same symptoms tested positive for the virus. Related: Bird flu virus circulated in cows for four months before outbreak confirmed by USDA, analysis shows. Given the infected human was a dairy farm worker with reported exposure to sick, presumably infected cows in Texas and without reported exposure to other mammals or birds, we believe the genetic and epidemiologic data are strong evidence of infection of the human following exposure to presumably HPAI A(H5N1) virus-infected cows, they wrote in the supplementary materials that accompanied their report. HPAI A(H5N1) is scientific shorthand for highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of the H5N1 subtype. The term highly pathogenic applies only to how the virus behaves when it infects poultry, though people might easily assume it applies more broadly, given how deadly this virus has proven to be over the decades. Roughly half of the people known to have been infected died. It kills wild birds and dozens of mammalian species, including cats (domestic and large cats), seals, foxes, mink, and many other scavenging carnivores that have had the misfortune of consuming infected wild birds. In the report the authors describe, the man’s illness was exceedingly mild. His lungs were clear and he had no trouble breathing; he had no fever. His sole symptom appeared to be conjunctivitis, a condition colloquially known as pink eye. The man and people he lived with were given flu antiviral drugs. He reported that his conjunctivitis cleared up. None of the people he lived with became sick. Ideally in cases like this, scientists would draw blood from the man and his contacts, as well as from other people working on the farm, to look for antibodies to the H5N1 virus. Presence of antibodies among other farm workers might suggest the virus is passing to people more commonly than has been seen. Antibodies in the blood of the man’s contacts could indicate that he transmitted the infection to them, but that their cases were so mild they didn’t have symptoms. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy But this work was not done, the report said, because the man and his contacts would not agree to have blood drawn. We were also unable to collect acute or convalescent sera to assess seroconversion in the dairy farm worker or household contacts, they said. Likewise it appears that health authorities were not allowed on the farm to investigate whether more workers might have been infected. The authors report that nasal swabs taken from the man also showed presence of virus, but at much lower levels than what was found in his conjunctiva, the tissue surrounding the eye. They hypothesize that the man could have been infected by one of two routes. Either virus in the air in the milking parlor landed in his eyes reportedly he did not wear eye protection or he may have had virus on his hands or gloves and transferred it to his eye inadvertently, they suggested. Analysis of the genetic sequence of the virus retrieved from this man has shown that while it is closely related to the viruses that have been causing the cow outbreaks, it does not fit neatly into the viral family tree that scientists studying the sequences have developed. The authors suggested that it’s possible the virus was from a slightly different offshoot that has died off; alternatively, there could have been more than one spillover event from birds in the Texas panhandle region where these outbreaks were first observed. Related: Tracking bird flu virus changes in cows is stymied by missing data, scientists say To date, 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus, though it is believed that many more have experienced outbreaks but have not been tested. Both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC have acknowledged that farmers have often refused to cooperate with their efforts to investigate these outbreaks. The report noted that the virus from the man was closely related, genetically, to the viruses used to produce two batches of H5N1 vaccine that the U.S. government has made and stockpiled as a hedge against a bird flu pandemic.

{"id": "528", "title": "Bird flu outbreak: Don't drink that raw milk, no matter what social media tells you", "date": "2024-05-03", "fulltext": "Don't drink raw milk, no matter what social media tells you. Seriously. In an update on the current outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. on Wednesday, federal agencies revealed that recent testing on commercial dairy products detected remnants of the virus in one in five samples, though none contained the live virus that could sicken people. Officials also said that testing on contaminated dairy reaffirmed that pasteurization is an effective means of killing the bird flu virus, making it safe to consume. Despite the assurances, a seemingly growing pocket of influencers and content creators online, particularly TikTok, have taken to boasting about drinking raw milk, touting supposed benefits and sowing seeds of skepticism as to the safety of pasteurization. While the science-backed practice has been used for over 100 years, some believe it's unnecessary or even harmful. Unfortunately, that could mean anyone who takes their advice could be playing with fire, especially if the raw product is consumed by children, the elderly, a pregnant person or someone with a compromised immune system. Here's what to know about pasteurization and what it does to the products we consume. Backyard chickens: Here's how to protect your flock from bird flu outbreaks What is pasteurization and why is it important? Pasteurization is the process of heating milk to a high enough temperature for a long enough time to kill harmful germs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The process of pasteurization became routine in the commercial milk supply in the U.S. in the 1920s and was widespread by the 1950s. As a result, illnesses commonly spread via milk became less prevalent. While misinformation about the process has led some to believe that pasteurized milk is less nutritious or better for people with lactose intolerance, pasteurization does not significantly compromise the nutritional value or content of milk. In some states, selling raw milk directly to a consumer is even illegal. What can happen if you consume raw dairy? Raw milk can carry a host of harmful bacteria, including: * Salmonella * E. coli * Listeria monocytogenes * Campylobacter * Coxiella burnetti * Cryptosporidium * Yersinia enterocolitica * Staph aureus * Other foodborne illness-causing bacteria. The presence of these can cause a variety of health issues and ailments, including: * Listeriosis * Typhoid fever * Tuberculosis * Diphtheria * Q fever * Brucellosis * Food poisoning * Miscarriage * Guillain-Barre syndrome * Hemolytic uremic syndrome * Reactive arthritis * Chronic inflammatory conditions * Death. Bird flu testing: As bird flu virus concerns grow in US, so do tests of milk, cheese, meat and other foods. Why are some social media users pushing unpasteurized milk and dairy? Fringe ideas of health, wellness and nutrition have become easily widespread and somewhat popular with the use of social media. On TikTok, many homesteading, 'tradwife,' 'all-natural' and other self-proclaimed wellness influencers push the idea of raw milk, presenting the idea that less intervention of any kind in their food is better. Some also claim that they have been drinking it for years without illness, that they believe drinking it has cured their lactose intolerance and other health conditions, or that the raw milk contains vital nutrients and ingredients that are done away with by pasteurization. Others simply say they see it as a means of subverting what they see as undue government regulation on their food and drink. Even big names like Gwyneth Paltrow, who has been criticized for her comments on nutrition in the past, have promoted the idea of drinking raw milk. Why? Some people may just be misinformed, convinced by anecdotal evidence, or even think they are helping others. Some cite an overall distrust of government regulations involving food, while others have products they hope to sell after disseminating misinformation, plugging them at the end of their videos or in their bios. As it stands, consuming unpasteurized milk and dairy can easily lead to many of the illnesses already listed. The spread of bird flu is certainly not the only reason to ensure you are drinking properly treated milk, but it is yet another thing to be aware of when it comes to making decisions about food safety. People with compromised immune systems, pregnant people and other at-risk people should avoid cheeses made with unpasteurized milk as well.

{"id": "529", "title": "Texas farmer diagnosed with bird flu from cow had intense eye bleeding, gross new photo shows", "date": "2024-05-04", "fulltext": "A dairy worker in Texas who was diagnosed with bird flu experienced painful bleeding in both of his eyes, a disturbing new image of the patient shows, and fluid oozed from one of them. The farm worker reported eye discomfort and redness late last month after coming into contact with sick cattle. The livestock exhibited similar symptoms to cows in northern Texas that were diagnosed with the H5N1 virus, according to a medical report published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The patient was quickly diagnosed with the bird flu strain Type A H5N1, which is spreading rapidly among livestock. Doctors released the first image of a patient diagnosed with bird flu, who experienced hemorrhaging in the eyes. Timothy M. Uyeki et al/New England Journal of Medicine Doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which initially diagnosed the unidentified person, released a photo as part of the report on Friday. It outlined the symptoms and showed the patient's bloodshot eyes severely hemorrhaged. The right eye, which experienced the fluid drainage, was especially red. The worker wore gloves but no face mask or eye protection when he dealt with the animals, according to doctors. The virus appeared to infect only the farmhand's eyes and luckily didn't spread to his lungs. The patient had no changes in vision, fever or any other symptoms and the fiery pinkeye cleared up within days, according to the report. The first report of a human contracting the bird flu from cows came just a week after dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with the virus. Casa.da.Photo — stock.adobe.com The mild case isn't guaranteed — while some people don't develop any noticeable symptoms, others can come down with severe, life-threatening pneumonia. Around 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization, and some experts fear the real threat would come if there are further mutations. The patient was told to isolate and was treated with an antiviral drug for the flu, according to the CDC. The agency said in a release on April 1 that the threat to the general public remains low despite the infection, but those with close or prolonged exposure to infected birds or other animals are at greater risk. Authorities also insist the nation's meat dairy supply is not at risk. The Texas worker became the second person in the US to contract the virus, according to federal and state officials. Officials say the recent bird flu infection does not mean there is any greater risk to the general public. It was originally detected in Antarctica in October 2023. Chilean Antarctic Institute/AFP via Getty Images The latest diagnosis came a week after dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with the virus. Herds in Michigan, Idaho and New Mexico have since tested positive for bird flu. Thirty-six total dairy herds were affected as of Thursday, according to the CDC. The first human infection was in 2022, when a prison inmate contracted the disease while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Colorado.

{"id": "530", "title": "The U.S. may be missing human cases of bird flu, scientists say", "date": "2024-05-06", "fulltext": "Officially, there is only one documented case of bird flu spilling over from cows into humans during the current U.S. outbreak. But epidemiologist Gregory Gray suspects the true number is higher, based on what he heard from veterinarians, farm owners and the workers themselves as the virus hit their herds in his state. 'We know that some of the workers sought medical care for influenza-like illness and conjunctivitis at the same time the H5N1 was ravaging the dairy farms,' says Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. 'I don't have a way to measure that, but it seems biologically quite plausible that they too, are suffering from the virus,' he says. Gray has spent decades studying respiratory infections in people who work with animals, including dairy cattle. He points out that 'clustering of flu-like illness and conjunctivitis' has been documented with previous outbreaks involving bird flu strains that are lethal for poultry like this current one. Luckily, genetic sequencing of the virus doesn't indicate it has evolved to easily spread among humans. Still, epidemiologists say it's critical to track any possible cases. They're concerned some human infections could be flying under the radar, especially if they are mild and transient as was seen in the Texas dairy worker who caught the virus. 'I think based on how many documented cases in cows there are, probably some decent human exposure is occurring,' says Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor of veterinary preventive medicine at The Ohio State University. 'We just don't really know.' Limited testing raises concerns There have been 36 herds affected in nine states. Local and state health departments have tested about 25 people for the virus and monitored over 100 for symptoms, federal health officials said at a briefing on Wednesday. These people are in 'the footprints of where the bovine detections are,' says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who's with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although he didn't provide details on the actual locations. 'There's a very low threshold for individuals to get tested,' he adds. The lack of testing early in the outbreak isn't necessarily surprising. In places like Texas and Kansas, veterinarians weren't thinking about bird flu when illnesses first cropped up in early March and it took time to identify the virus as the culprit. But the total number of tests done on humans at this point seems low to Jessica Leibler, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health. 'If the idea was to try to identify where there was spillover from these facilities to human populations, you'd want to try to test as many workers as possible,' says Leibler, who has studied the risk of novel zoonotic influenza and animal agriculture. Also, notes Gray, the virus is probably much more geographically widespread in cattle than the reported cases show, 'possibly spilling over much more to humans than we knew, or then we know.' The federal government has been quick to assess the safety of the dairy supply. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration released findings, showing that infectious virus wasn't present in about 200 samples collected from dairy products around the country. Initial results on ground meat are also reassuring. However, there still remain 'serious gaps' in public health officials' ability to detect bird flu among those who work with cows, a task made all the more difficult by the fact that some cases may not be symptomatic, says Leibler. 'There's really widespread opportunity for worker exposure to this virus.' Only complicating matters is the true scale of the outbreak in cattle remains murky, although new federal testing requirements for moving cattle between states may help fill out the picture. 'Some of the dairy herds seem to have clinically normal animals, but potentially infected and [that] makes it really hard to know where to do surveillance,' says Bowman. Calls for proactive steps to track down possible human cases The health care system would likely catch any alarming rise in human cases of bird flu, according to modeling done by the CDC. Federal health officials monitor influenza activity in emergency departments and hospitals. Hundreds of clinical laboratories that run tests are tasked with reporting findings. And in early April, a CDC health alert was sent to clinicians advising them to be on the lookout for anyone with flu-like symptoms or conjunctivitis who'd worked with livestock. But even these safeguards may not be sufficient to get ahead of an outbreak. 'I worry a bit that if we wait until we see a spike in those systems that perhaps we would already be seeing much more widespread community transmission,' says Dr. Mary-Margaret Fill, deputy state epidemiologist for the Tennessee Department of Health. Instead she says there should be proactive testing. Fill notes there are anecdotes about farmworkers with mild illness while working with cattle in some of the areas where the virus has spread and 'not enough visibility on the testing that's happening or not happening in those populations to understand what might be going on.' To get ahead of the virus, Leibler says not only do workers need to be screened but also their family members and others in the community, in the event that the virus does evolve to spread easily among humans. Dr. Rodney Young says doctors in the Texas panhandle have been vigilant about any cases of influenza, particularly among those who are around livestock, but so far there are no indications of anything out of the ordinary. 'We just haven't seen people who fit that description in order to suddenly be testing a lot more,' says Young, regional chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center School of Medicine in Amarillo. Getting buy-in from dairy farms Gray says it can be hard to detect and measure the illness in these rural workers for many reasons - their remote location, a reluctance to seek out health care, a lack of health insurance, concerns about immigration status, and a reticence among farmers 'to wave the flag' that there are infections. The farms he works with consider protecting workers and curbing the spread of this virus 'a huge priority,' but right now they bear all the risks of going public, he says. Dr. Fred Gingrich says this is a major barrier to closer cooperation between federal health officials and the industry during the current crisis. Dairy cattle farmers currently don't get compensated for reporting infections in their herds - unlike poultry farmers who receive indemnity payments for losses related to culling birds when they find cases, says Gingrich, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners. 'So what is their incentive to report?' he says, 'It's the same virus. It just doesn't kill our cows.' Gray has managed to start collecting samples from humans and cattle at several dairy farms that recently dealt with the virus. It's part of a study that he launched before the H5N1 outbreak in response to concerns about SARSCoV-2 spillover on farms. They'll look for evidence of exposure to novel influenza, including bird flu --something he's able to pull off because of his background in this area and his guarantee that the farms will be kept anonymous in the published work.

{"id": "532", "title": "WHO� top scientist learned a hard lesson about H5N1 two decades ago: Stopping it takes more than biology", "date": "2024-05-07", "fulltext": "Jeremy Farrar, now the World Health Organization's chief scientist, was working in Vietnam 20 years ago when the H5N1 virus started to spread across Asia—at that point in poultry. He recalls there was a reluctance among farmers to cull their chickens because they weren't being compensated for them. Movement of infected birds to evade culling only served to disseminate the virus, which in the years since has spread to all continents except Australia. It's important to keep that experience in mind, he told STAT Monday, as the H5N1 bird flu virus now spreads among dairy cattle in the U.S. Farrar stressed that the social context is key in responding to disease threats like H5N1, noting that a similar reluctance among dairy farmers to report outbreaks or allow testing of their workers is adding to the challenges in assessing how much transmission is occurring and the risk it poses to people. That fits with the description of how this virus is behaving in cows, with clear signs of infection in the udders, but little evidence of respiratory tract infections and no reports to date of cows experiencing neurological symptoms. This virus has been seen to attack the brains of a number of other mammalian species it can infect, including cats, which is why consideration of whether cows' brains are also susceptible is important. The work was done by scientists at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark's Statens Serum Institut, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. FURTHER READING Go deeper: H5N1 bird flu in cows The bird flu virus currently poses a low risk to humans, but it still keeps the CDC's top flu expert up at night. Pasteurization inactivates the H5N1 virus in milk. Scientists say raw milk should be especially avoided now that avian flu has been found in cows. Alarm, not harm: Dairy state lawmakers urge restrained approach and government assistance to farmers dealing with avian flu outbreak. Pandemic preparedness experts call for bird flu wastewater surveillance. The distribution of the receptor types some of which avian flu viruses can attach to, others to which human flu viruses attach raises concerns that cows could potentially give rise to a version of H5N1 or another novel flu virus that is able to transmit efficiently to and among people, the authors suggested. \"These results provide a mechanistic rationale for the high levels of H5N1 virus reported in infected bovine milk and show cattle have the potential to act as a mixing vessel for novel [influenza virus] generation,\" they wrote. Pigs, which can be infected with both bird flu and human flu viruses, have traditionally been referred to as mixing vessels for new viruses that could pose a pandemic threat. That's because when an animal is co-infected with different flu viruses, the pathogens can swap genes, a process called reassortment. That phenomenon could give rise to new virus strains with enough human genes to be able to easily infect people, but also enough bird flu genes to be foreign enough to human immune systems that they could pose a serious risk to human health. Cows have not been thought to pose such a risk. Though it's known they can be infected with flu viruses, influenza hasn't been seen to be a major issue for cows. And until this outbreak, cows have not played a role in the H5N1 story. This virus, first seen in China in 1996, is primarily one that infects wild birds and domestic poultry, though it has been shown to be able to infect numerous mammalian species over the nearly three decades that have followed. In that time, nearly 900 human infections have been detected. Of those people, roughly half have died. In the current U.S. outbreak, one human case has been detected, a dairy farm worker in Texas whose sole symptom was conjunctivitis. It's widely believed there may have been other cases, but farmers have in many cases been unwilling to cooperate with health authorities trying to investigate the outbreak and many of the workers have been wary of cooperating as well. Related: Texas dairy farm worker's case may be first where bird flu virus spread from mammal to human, scientists say Some scientists not involved in the research described the paper as interesting, but questioned whether one could conclude cows pose a mixing vessel risk based on these findings. Malik Peiris, chair of virology in the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health, told STAT in an email that previous research has shown that cows are not highly susceptible to human flu viruses. Furthermore, it would be hard to see how a human flu virus could reach a cow's udder, which contains receptors for both avian and human flu viruses. \"Thus, I do not think the risk of human flu-H5N1 reassortment in cows is likely.\" Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, Canada, agreed, noting that knowing which tissues a flu virus can attach to only tells part of the story. There are other factors, she said, that determine whether or not a virus can replicate in the cells it attaches to, triggering infection. That said, Rasmussen, who studies animal diseases that can jump into people, is still worried about H5N1 in cows. To date, H5N1 infections have been confirmed in 36 herds in nine states. \"I'm more concerned about cow H5 evolving toward human-to-human transmission by jumping between different hosts (bird to cow to human, cow to bird to cat, cow to cat) as well as cow to cow. This selects for viruses that can infect, replicate efficiently, and shed enough to transmit onward in many different hosts, and increases the odds that it could do so in a human one,\" she wrote in an email. \"These data are confirmation to me that it is essential to get the cow outbreak under control, because there are many possibilities for a more transmissible human virus to emerge from it.\" The Danish researchers took samples of stored tissues brain, respiratory tract, and mammary gland from a small number of cows and a calf. Some of the cows were dairy cows; others were beef cattle. They stained the tissue to see what receptors they had, whether they were for human or avian flu viruses, and among the latter whether they were the type best adapted for viruses that circulate among chickens or those that circulate in wild ducks. A spillover of virus from wild birds is believed to have started this outbreak in cows. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy They found few receptors in the brain tissue they examined. \"What we found was that the influenza receptors were expressed in the neurons, but in a very low amount. So we also speculate that this could be the reason why there have not been found any neurological signs\" among infected cattle, said first author Charlotte Kristensen. Kristensen is defending her thesis this week and is set to begin postdoctoral research at the university, in the department of veterinary and animal sciences. A surprising finding was a lack of receptors in the ducts of the mammary glands, which the authors said argues against the notion that cows are becoming infected by what they call an \"ascending infection.\" The leading hypothesis for how this infection is spreading among cows is that when an infected cow enters a herd, small amounts of its H5N1-contaminated milk can remain on milking equipment, coming in contact with the teats of uninfected cows, who then become infected. Peiris, while agreeing the receptor pattern in the mammary ducts was surprising, said he still believes this route of infection is most likely, noting that there are reports that some cows only experience infection in some not all quarters of their udders. \"There is no other way to explain how one segment of the mammary gland is infected while others are unaffected,\" Peiris said. Rasmussen agreed. \"These results are interesting and good to know.

{"id": "533", "title": "Opinion: As livestock move around the country, so does H5N1. The U.S. needs real-time tracking of livestock movements", "date": "2024-05-07", "fulltext": "The presence of H5N1 avian influenza virus, better known as bird flu, among dairy cows in Texas—the second largest producer of dairy cattle—was first confirmed in late March. By then, H5N1 had likely been circulating among dairy cows for months. Six weeks later, the nine states responsible for more than one-quarter of U.S. dairy production, which accounts for 3.5% of the U.S.'s gross domestic product, had each reported H5N1 cases in dairy cows and continue to do so. Many questions remain open about the transmission of H5N1 among dairy cows and about the possibility of the virus adapting to transmit among humans. Even with the best possible outcomes, this outbreak reveals the precipice on which the U.S. rests with respect to livestock diseases. In the event of an infectious disease outbreak in livestock, even one that does not directly threaten human health, the costs can be catastrophic. The production of animal products (milk, other dairy products, eggs, and meat) can decrease drastically. Other costs can come from the control efforts or trade bans and loss of consumer demand. Twenty years ago, a single case of 'mad cow disease' caused U.S. beef exports to plummet by more than $2.5 billion, and domestic prices fell by 16%. News of the spread of avian influenza among U.S. dairy cows in late April led cattle futures to fall sharply at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the largest U.S. exchange for cattle futures). And Colombia, which buys $43 million in beef annually from the U.S., has restricted beef imports, even though no evidence has yet been found of the virus in beef cattle. Related: Study of cow tissues provides clues for unusual pattern of bird flu infections in dairy cattle Managing diseases in livestock in a country the size of the U.S. is a huge challenge due to the frequent and extensive movement of animals across the nation. That means local animal disease problems quickly become national. In the ongoing H5N1 outbreak, cattle were moved from a farm in Texas, where infected animals had been detected in March, to farms in Ohio and Michigan that tested positive in early April for a very similar strain of the virus. This suggests that direct cattle-to-cattle transmission is occurring, and implicates animal movements in the large-scale diffusion of the virus. ADVERTISEMENT National-scale movement of farm animals as they transition through the production cycle is a key component of this highly specialized industry and is unlikely to change. In the U.S., beef cattle might be born in one place, raised and fattened in another, then killed and butchered in another. The U.S. livestock industry is geographically dispersed and intensely connected: 60% of cattle born in a year cross state borders, with particular concentrations in the Plains states. This has been brought about by regional differences in livestock productivity and by economies of scale, which make it more cost-effective to ship live animals than shipping animal feed. The U.S. has one of the most intense livestock industries in the world, primarily due to the aggregation of production over the last 50 years and the presence of large markets and mega-scale animal feedlots that are unique to the U.S. When animal movements are disseminating infection, there is a particularly high risk of infection reaching premises with lots of traffic. Livestock markets act much as airports do for humans: they bring together animals (sometimes of multiple species) coming from many different farms, creating opportunities for contact between infected and susceptible animals before being sold and dispersed to other far-flung farms. Feedlots, facilities at which animals are fattened before slaughter or before being returned to the same or different dairy farms for stronger milk production, can also act as hubs for propagating infection. In response to the evolving H5N1 outbreak, the USDA has placed additional influenza-testing requirements on interstate movements of dairy cows. However, the limited information available about livestock movement indicates that the movements of most cattle (dairy or beef) from or to markets occur within states. While the USDA strategy is essential in limiting the geographical diffusion of H5N1, the disease could be moving long distances within states without detection. Given the integral role that livestock movement currently plays in U.S. agriculture, and the potential for animal movements to create pathways for the spread of pathogens, understanding the volume and structure of livestock movements across the U.S. is crucial to the success of the nation’s infectious disease management efforts. Unfortunately, livestock movements in the U.S. are only partially characterized and, in many states, only when animals cross state lines. But this information comes from veterinary inspection certificates that lack a uniform format. While this approach to tracking the movements of livestock animals aids the response to diseases, it lacks the speed and resolution required for most outbreaks, and it will not move forward the country’s preparedness in anticipation of the next livestock disease emergency. Related: Bird flu virus circulated in cows for four months before outbreak confirmed by USDA, analysis shows What is needed instead is a national view of the U.S. livestock industry that incorporates the vast degree of livestock movement that occurs within the industry. This would ideally be powered by a real-time animal identification and tracking system, where the movements of individual animals are prospectively recorded from birth to slaughter as they change ownership and location. Such 'animal passport systems' exist throughout the European Union and the U.K. In the U.S., a national animal identification and tracking system has been controversial due to concerns of infringement of property and private rights of individuals, the potential cost, and the exposure of business strategies crucial to market competitiveness. But states such as Michigan and Minnesota, motivated by the threat of bovine tuberculosis, and Montana and Wyoming, plagued by chronic outbreaks of brucellosis, have implemented cattle identification and tracking systems, setting examples for a successful national system. While the establishment of these state-level animal identification programs faced some opposition from producers, the keys to their successes have included a cost-effective system, the mandatory nature of the program, and clear communication and education about the benefits of animal identification for both disease management and production management. The use of animal tracking data in veterinary epidemiology and mathematical models would be crucial to U.S. preparedness and response to the inevitable future outbreak of an emerging livestock disease. In addition to improving animal health management, animal identification and tracking would also retain and increase export market access (currently out of reach due to unmet animal-tracking regulations), food safety assurances, and producer profitability by improved production efficiency and increased access to information. Information provided by animal identification and tracking would make it possible to estimate the scope of a potential outbreak and plan outbreak mitigation and control strategies. Driven by data on animal demographics and movement as well as disease-specific parameters, epidemiological modeling studies could help target and hone these plans to allow maximum business continuity and minimum use of resources. The benefits of collecting animal-movement data in real-time include evaluating the potential of an epidemic to spread, designing optimal surveillance programs and control strategies, accurate quantification of ongoing disease threats, and short- and long-term analysis of policies that may affect agricultural business practices. Each of these can help minimize the risk of the next livestock disease emergency, avoiding colossal economic and food losses, ameliorating animal welfare impacts, and mitigating the potential emergence of highly virulent strains with pandemic potential into human populations.", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "This suggests that direct cattle-to-cattle transmission is occurring, and implicates animal movements in the large-scale diffusion of the virus.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 1, "affirm_why_statement_1": "Many questions remain open about the transmission of H5N1 among dairy cows and about the possibility of the virus adapting to transmit among humans.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "In the ongoing H5N1 outbreak, cattle were moved from a farm in Texas, where infected animals had been detected in March, to farms in Ohio and Michigan that tested positive in early April for a very similar strain of the virus.

{"id": "534", "title": "If many dairy farm workers contract H5N1, we risk a pandemic", "date": "2024-05-07", "fulltext": "The discovery of bird flu virus particles in milk has moved the federal government to take more aggressive action to prevent the further spread of H5N1 on dairy farms. The Agriculture Department has rightly issued new testing recommendations meant to keep the virus from spreading across state lines. But this additional testing will do little to address the primary threat that H5N1 poses to humans: the infection of farmworkers. Our failure to protect them threatens their health and gives the virus an opportunity to evolve into a greater threat to people, including those who live far from dairy farms. The discovery of viral material in milk sold in American stores is not in itself alarming. Pasteurization, though it doesn't remove pathogens, destroys their ability to infect people. Follow-up testing has confirmed this: Researchers have not been able to isolate and grow the virus from pasteurized milk. But H5N1 poses risks to dairy workers, who may be exposed to infected cows and to milk before it is pasteurized. So far, only one dairy worker in the United States is known to have been infected, and fortunately this person experienced only mild eye inflammation. But there are reports that other dairy workers have gotten sick at the same time that cows have. Veterinarian Barb Peterson told Bovine Veterinarian, 'There's been underreporting of the virus. Understandably, there's been a lot of fear. But every dairy that I've worked with has—with the exception of one—had sick human beings at the same time they had sick cows.' These reports are concerning, not because the infections are severe but because any rise in human infections boosts the chances that the virus will find its way to someone who has more medical conditions and may have a worse disease outcome if infected. And H5N1 has not historically been mild in humans. Of the almost 900 known cases of H5N1 infection in humans worldwide, the virus has killed about half. So it is crucial to protect from exposure farmworkers who are likely to be in contact with infected animals. The eye protection and masks recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should be readily available to all dairy workers. All states have access to this protective equipment, but making sure dairy farms and operations provide it to their workers and normalize its use will take education. Dairy workers also need H5N1 vaccines; efforts to make them available need to be expedited. And because many farmworkers are immigrants, work is needed to overcome both a widespread lack of health insurance and strong financial and legal disincentives to report infections. U.S. health officials have said that the virus now showing up on dairy farms is a good match for vaccines under development. But they have not been clear about the status of vaccines in the existing stockpile, or when the Food and Drug Administration might authorize them to be used. As we learned from covid-19, delays in vaccination could lead to unnecessary deaths. Protecting workers and preventing the next pandemic also require greater virus surveillance on farms and in dairy processing facilities. The USDA's updated requirements, which mandate the testing of lactating cows only when they are about to move to another state, won't protect farmworkers. The tests have to be sent to laboratories, and this delays results that would signal the need to protect people. More widespread testing on dairy farms remains voluntary and limited to animals with symptoms—despite evidence that cows experience asymptomatic infections and that other farm animals also have been infected. Wider testing of cows is challenging but essential, as is expanded testing of workers in the dairy industry. Everyone working on dairy farms needs immediate access to antiviral medications in case an outbreak occurs. Rapid tests need to be quickly developed so that samples can be analyzed on farms rather than sent away to labs. And it is crucial to regularly sequence virus samples isolated from cows in order to monitor any genetic mutations that could improve the virus's ability to infect humans or to evade antiviral medicines. The USDA has so far been slow to share genetic information on virus samples gathered from infected cows, and this must change immediately. Preventing farmworker infections and uncontrolled spread in mammals is key to stopping the virus from spreading more easily among humans. This requires active coordination among federal, state, and local agricultural and public health officials. Jennifer B.

{"id": "535", "title": "Bird flu in US cows: where will it end?", "date": "2024-05-08", "fulltext": "Scientists worry that the H5N1 strain of avian influenza will become endemic in cattle, which would aid its spread in people. Concerns that pasteurized milk in the United States is teeming with H5N1 avian influenza virus are over. But there's no sign that the outbreak in cows is over, and scientists are increasingly concerned that cattle will become a permanent reservoir for this adaptable virus, giving it more chances to mutate and jump to humans. New data show that the virus can hop back and forth between cows and birds, a trait that could allow it to spread across wide geographical regions. Although the virus kills many types of mammal, most infected cows don't develop severe symptoms or die, meaning that no one knows whether an animal is infected without testing it. Moreover, a single cow can host several types of flu virus, which could, over time, swap genetic material to generate a strain that can more readily infect humans. Eventually the wrong combination of gene segments and mutations inevitably comes along, says Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Whatever opportunity we may have had to nip it in the bud we lost by a really slow detection. Viral expansion H5N1 isn't a new virus; various forms of it have been circulating since the 1990s. A particularly deadly variant that was first detected in 1996 has killed millions of birds and has been found in numerous mammalian species, including seals and mink. But until now, cows were not among the virus's known hosts. US officials first announced on 25 March that H5N1 had been found in cattle, and cows from 36 herds in 9 states have tested positive as of 7 May. Tests of pasteurized milk have found no living virus. But the virus's increasing ubiquity has made scientists uneasy. Every time it gets a new mammalian host species, like cows, there's more risk of human transmission and reduced human immunity, says Jessica Leibler, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University in Massachusetts. Bovine breakthrough Genomic data are starting to shed light on the origins of the cattle outbreak. In a 1 May preprint posted on bioRxiv, scientists at the US Department of Agriculture analysed more than 200 viral genomes taken from cows and found that the virus jumped from wild birds to cattle in late 2023. That result corroborates findings by Worobey and others in an analysis posted on the discussion forum virological.org on 3 May. (Neither article has yet been peer reviewed.) Want to prevent pandemics? Stop spillovers Because cows infected with H5N1 generally don't die of the flu, they are effective mixing vessels in which viruses can swap genetic material with other viruses, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. Even worse, the current strain seems to infect several species equally well. If you have a virus that's hopscotching back and forth between cows, humans and birds, that virus is going to have selective pressures to grow efficiently in all those species, she says. The larger the number of infected animals, Rasmussen says, the more chances the virus has to acquire helpful mutations, such as the ability to grow in the upper respiratory tract, which could make it more transmissible between people. Dangerous reservoir From a human perspective, Worobey says, cows might be one of the worst possible animal reservoirs for influenza because of their sheer number and the degree to which humans interact with them. Culling poultry has curbed previous bird flu outbreaks, but Rasmussen says that isn't a viable option for cattle. The animals are too valuable and, unlike birds, don't seem to die from the infection. H5N1 could even become endemic in cows, says Gregory Gray, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Other strains related to H5N1 are already endemic in chickens and pigs in some parts of the world. Flu on the farm Researchers aren't sure how the virus is spreading between herds. Wild birds, which congregate around cattle feed and defecate in the cows' water supply, are one probable source. Cattle are just one big birdfeeder, Gray says, adding that birds can spread infections much further than cows can and are much less controllable. Some evidence has suggested that farm equipment, such as milking machines, could be to blame, but several scientists worry that it could be airborne. I'm really thinking that's occurring and we've not been able to study it, Gray says, mainly because farmers have been reluctant to allow inspectors to test their cattle. Some related variants that infect horses have been found to spread through the air for kilometres, which could explain how the current strain has moved between dairy farms. Until more is known about the virus's transmission route, Worobey says, it's hard to determine the best way to contain it. Since late April, the US Department of Agriculture has required that cows are tested before being transported across state lines. That won't necessarily stop the virus's spread, but it could at least help researchers to understand where it's going. Herd immunity If the virus is airborne, Gray says, vaccinating cows might be an option. H5N1 vaccines have not yet been used in US cattle. But influenza vaccines have proved effective in pigs and poultry, and researchers are beginning to test them against the H5N1 strain infecting dairy herds. Data on how well the virus spreads between people are scarce. A study published on 3 May in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed that one dairy worker in Texas had been infected and that the worker experienced mild symptoms. But the people who worked and live with the infected person have not been tested. Still, US officials have not reported a large number of deaths or severe cases in humans, suggesting that the virus hasn't become highly transmissible or deadly, Worobey says. Below the radar But Gray says that there have been anecdotal reports of many more human cases. Leibler suspects that exposure of farm workers is widespread. When you see symptomatic patients, that's the tip of the iceberg, she says. In the worst-case scenario, she says, the virus would spread undetected in several species for a long time, accumulating mutations that prime it for causing a pandemic in the future. We have an awareness now from the COVID pandemic of how devastating that could be, she says. Leibler hopes that public-health efforts will begin testing workers and their families so that any transmission in humans will quickly be detected. H5N1 is with us, she says. It's not a virus that's going to disappear by any means. References 1. Burrough E. R. et al. Emerg. Infect. Dis https://doi.org/10.3201/eid3007.240508 (2024) 2. Nguyen, T.-Q. et al.

All the evidence generated to date indicates that pasteurization is effective at inactivating H5N1 in milk, though the FDA continues to study the issue. That is a huge relief. But it raises a big and important question: How is it that so much virus is getting off of affected farms and into the national milk supply in the first place? The most plausible and also the most concerning scenario is that visibly sick cows, the ones with strange looking milk and flu-like malaise, are just the tip of the outbreak. Although there's little hard data at this point, scientists say the available evidence suggests that many more animals are likely being infected and producing virus-laced milk without any noticeable symptoms or changes to their milk's color and consistency. FURTHER READING H5N1 bird flu: Go deeper The top scientist at the WHO says social factors are as important as biology in controlling the spread of a virus. Jeremy Farrar warns of compliance reluctance, from migrant workers to farmers fearing financial losses. In studying possible methods of bird flu transmission, scientists look at where the H5N1 virus is most prevalent in cows the udders. The bird flu threat to humans remains low, but potential mutations keep the CDC's top flu scientist up at night. First Opinion essay: To curb bird flu spread, the U.S. needs real-time tracking of livestock movements. Viral fragments in milk are likely from subclinically infected cows, Andrew Bowman, a veterinary epidemiologist at Ohio State University, told STAT. In a recent study of 150 commercial milk products representing dairy processing plants in 10 different states including Texas, Kansas, and others where herds have tested positive for H5N1 Bowman's team found viral RNA in nearly 40% of them. A larger survey of 297 milk products, including cottage cheese and sour cream, conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, found viral RNA from the H5N1 bird flu in about 20% of samples. The presence of viral genetic fragments is not believed to represent a risk to human health. Because pasteurization is a thermal process and doesn't involve the physical removal of any bacteria or viruses, the sensitive tests used for identifying DNA or RNA can detect dead genetic material left behind. Additional studies by both Bowman's team and FDA scientists found no evidence of infectious virus in the store-bought milk products sampled. We were hoping all that milk was getting caught before it entered the supply system, said Andrew Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist who studies respiratory viruses at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Now we're relying particularly on pasteurization to say the milk is safe. There are a few other possible explanations for how virus-containing milk is getting off the farm. One is that farmers are simply ignoring the FDA's instructions to discard milk from infected cows. But farmers have strong incentives both in the interest of public health and their own economic outlook to not allow abnormal milk into bulk tanks. Human error or neglect could also be at play, but unlikely given that milk from clinically affected cows is so obviously abnormal. Related: Pasteurization inactivates H5N1 bird flu in milk, new FDA and academic studies confirm An FDA spokesperson did not directly address questions about how H5N1 is winding up in the national milk supply. In a statement, the agency acknowledged the possibility that asymptomatic cows may be shedding virus and reiterated its stance that the dairy industry refrain from manufacturing or selling raw milk products. Given the detection of H5N1 in dairy cows is a novel and evolving situation, we are still learning about the dynamics of this particular virus, the statement said. The FDA currently recommends that farmers discard milk only from symptomatic cows. The agency also has instructed farmers to take extra precautions, including heat-treating or pasteurizing milk, prior to disposing it or feeding it to calves or other farm animals. A recent investigation of outbreaks at dairy farms in Texas and Kansas found that at one farm where cats were fed unpasteurized milk from sick cows, about half the cats died after suffering neurologic symptoms. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture referred questions to the FDA. In a technical note the USDA released on Tuesday, further clarifying a federal order to require testing of lactating dairy cows prior to interstate travel, the agency said it is not placing restrictions on the shipping or processing of milk from herds that have a non-negative test that is any result that is either presumptively positive, suspect, or otherwise not obviously negative. The note reiterated the FDA's recommendations that producers discard milk from symptomatic cows. But crucially, milk from cows in the same herd that are not showing symptoms but may have been infected can be sent for processing under these rules. Every tank of milk that travels from a dairy farm to a processor is sampled and screened for the presence of bacteria, antibiotics, and somatic cell counts. These are a measure of the immune cells that show up whenever a cow has an infection. Most dairy farmers receive an incentive bonus for better quality milk; the lower the somatic cell count, the higher the price it commands. Related: There's never a good time to drink raw milk. But now's a really bad time as bird flu infects cows Given how the H5N1 virus is behaving in cows, with clear signs of infection in the udders, but little evidence of respiratory tract infections, it's reasonable to believe somatic cell counts would be significantly elevated in sick animals, Terry Lehenbauer, a bovine disease epidemiologist and director of the Veterinary Medicine Teaching and Research Center at the University of California, Davis told STAT via email. The dairy farmer would be motivated to not allow abnormal milk from affected cows to go into the bulk tank. That's why he believes the most likely contributor to the problem is that there are infected dairy herds with asymptomatic animals producing H5N1-laced milk that looks normal. But with farmers reluctant to allow inspectors to test their cattle because of stigma and a lack of financial incentives to do so they can't know if their cows are the ones introducing the virus into the milk supply. It is getting introduced, that much is clear. Not just from commercial milk testing, but also from analyzing what's flowing through city sewers. About a year ago, researchers at Stanford University and Emory University developed a probe to detect H5N1 genetic material in city wastewater, to be ready just in case it jumped into humans. The work was part of WastewaterSCAN, a nationwide initiative to fish out fragments of RNA or DNA from viruses like SARS-CoV-2, human influenzas, and monkeypox from sewage, in collaboration with Verily Life Sciences. The probe hadn't yet been operationalized when the researchers began seeing unusual spikes in influenza A in parts of northern Texas in February, March and April of this year. Unusual because the human flu season had already mostly passed, and because the numbers were so huge. Some of the concentrations we measured were among the highest overall influenza concentrations that we've ever measured as part of the program, said Marlene Wolfe, an environmental microbiologist and epidemiologist at Emory University and a co-principal investigator for WastewaterSCAN. Based on that aberration and the reports of H5N1 outbreaks in cattle, her team decided to go back and apply the probe to samples collected at three wastewater treatment plants two in Amarillo and one in Dallas dating back to February 4. Related: From sewage to safety: Hospital wastewater surveillance as a beacon for defense against H5N1 bird flu In a preprint posted last month, Wolfe and her team described what they found: large concentrations of the H5 gene ticking up in mid-March, at the same time the USDA was confirming the first outbreaks in dairy cows in the Texas panhandle. They also found that all three sewershed areas they tested were home to dairy processing facilities with permits to discharge milk byproducts into the sewers. Such discharges are highly regulated and carefully monitored, with strict limits on volume, pH, and components such as fats, oil, and grease, Rachel Ravencraft, a spokesperson for the National Milk Producers Federation, said in an email. That's because large influxes of milk, with its high concentrations of fat and protein, can overwhelm municipal wastewater treatment systems and mess with the microorganisms that break down sewage. In a typical processing environment, Ravencraft said, about 1% of fluid milk gets lost during normal operations, including cleaning and sanitizing equipment. No one just dumps a volume of milk down the drain. That fits with what the Wastewater SCAN scientists think happened in North Texas. Our hypothesis is focused on the discharge of waste from facilities that are operating, for the most part, we believe, as expected, and that there is likely an H5 influenza that is part of that discharge, Wolfe said. For now, it's just a hypothesis, she emphasized. Wastewater surveillance can't determine the number of cases associated with those spikes, how many cows might be contributing to the uptick, or even what species is shedding this into the sewer. At this stage where we are sort of early still in this response, and there's not a lot of testing available, having the situational awareness about what is present in an area that we can get from wastewater and some information on trends, is useful. NEWSLETTERS Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Enter your email Privacy Policy One thing that's useful in this case, is the indication that there may have been additional unidentified outbreaks among cattle in the region with milk sent to these facilities since milk from infected animals is required to be diverted from the food supply. Even though the measures of discarding milk and pasteurizing milk are not always perfect by themselves, Lehenbauer said, the combination of these actions together have provided strong evidence that our current milk supply is safe. While the evidence so far supports the effectiveness of pasteurization, microorganism destruction depends on the combination of temperature and holding times in the pasteurizer as well as the specific properties of the pathogen and how many of them are present in the milk. Higher levels of bacteria or viruses will take more time to kill. The FDA has been testing samples of raw milk trucked from farms to processing facilities to better understand how much virus the pasteurization equipment might encounter, officials told reporters at a briefing last week. That information will be used to inform additional experiments the agency plans to conduct to further validate the effectiveness of different pasteurization methods. The method used depends on whether the milk is intended for drinking, making cheese, yogurt, ice cream, or to be dried into powdered milk or baby formula. Such studies are more important now than ever as it's becoming increasingly clear that attempts to keep contaminated milk from reaching dairy processing plants are falling short. Although public officials continue to stress that the bird flu virus currently poses a low risk to humans, they do worry about it spreading silently throughout the nation's dairy cattle herds.

{"id": "537", "title": "How Bird Flu Caught the Dairy Industry Off Guard", "date": "2024-05-09", "fulltext": "In the weeks since the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced a bird flu outbreak in dairy cows that had gone undiagnosed for months, bystanders have wondered why it took so long to identify. Experts say there are key scientific and political reasons why the dairy industry was caught off guard by the H5N1 avian influenza virus—and that understanding those factors will be vital to controlling the disease on dairy farms and preventing an outbreak in humans. “The dairy industry has never had to deal with something like this before,” says Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and a former dairy veterinarian. “This is probably going to be the most important outbreak in my professional career.” After weeks of uncertainty—fueled by the unnerving revelation that the outbreak likely began last December and took months to recognize—the federal government is taking some action. The USDA has mandated testing for lactating cows that are being transported across state lines in the hopes of squashing the spread of the virus, which has so far been confirmed in 36 herds across nine states. One human case has been reported this year, but the infection was mild, and more than a month has passed with no new cases confirmed. Epidemiologists have called for more human testing to better monitor the situation, however. Meanwhile Food and Drug Administration testing has shown that viral particles that were found in pasteurized milk were not infectious, suggesting little threat to consumers. Authorities’ scramble to understand and control the situation is particularly concerning because scientists have long worried about the potential for an H5N1 strain to jump into humans and cause a pandemic. And bird flu has been devastating poultry farms around the world for years now. Veterinarians and epidemiologists have been on high alert since 2022, when a new strain began tearing through wild birds and even mammals, killing or forcing U.S. farmers to cull some 90 million domestic birds. How could it take months to notice the same virus was spreading in dairy cows? One reason the outbreak went undetected for so long is that people thought it was unlikely that the virus would jump into cows. Avian influenza is, after all, most common in birds, whereas flus in general have been rare in cows. “The chances of it going from migratory birds to cows were so low,” Poulsen says. “And then it happened.” Dairy farmers typically worry about contagious bacterial mastitis, an infection of a cow’s udder, or bovine viral diarrhea—illnesses the industry is familiar with and knows how to treat. Avian influenza “wasn’t on our bingo cards for the year,” says Emily Yeiser Stepp, an animal scientist and executive director of the National Dairy Farmers Assuring Responsible Management (FARM) Program. The program, which is housed within a lobbying group called the National Milk Producers Federation, acts as an on-farm social responsibility program for the dairy industry, a mission that includes promoting animal health. The next challenge was connecting the dots to determine what was infecting the cows—which was difficult because the symptoms of H5N1 in these animals weren’t known in advance and aren’t particularly distinctive. Sick cows weren’t eating well and were producing less milk—and the milk that they did produce was sometimes thick and yellow-hued. But none of these symptoms were particularly unusual, says Meghan Davis, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former dairy veterinarian. “The number-one presenting complaint to call a vet out to your farm is: [your cow is] off feed, and you can’t figure out why,” Davis says. “So it’s not surprising to me that it took a minute to figure this out.” Moreover, only about 10 percent of an affected dairy herd seems to get infected with H5N1. And cows aren’t dying; they bounce back to health within a couple of weeks. “Cows are like walking battle tanks,” Poulsen says. But this is also a very different manifestation of avian influenza than that seen in domestic chickens: H5N1 can blaze through and devastate a flock in days, he adds. Wild mammals that have been infected with avian influenza display serious respiratory and even neurological symptoms such as seizures. In contrast, infected cows are tricky to spot. “You need to look for it; it’s not something very apparent,” says Zelmar Rodriguez, a dairy veterinarian at Michigan State University, who has visited farms with H5N1-infected cows. Because farmers didn’t know they had avian influenza on their hands, the low impact of the disease made it easy for them to shrug off the infection. Once veterinarians pinned down H5N1 as the culprit, the situation became more serious because of the implications for human health. The complications of the dairy outbreak make containing it a challenge, however. Scientists still aren’t certain how avian influenza jumps between cows. Influenzas are typically considered respiratory diseases, yet cows seem to produce the most virus in their udders, so milking machinery could be carrying virus-laden droplets of milk from one cow to the next. Lactating cows can experience discomfort when they are not milked regularly, so all that’s left for farmers to do is to try to increase safety measures in the milking process itself. Adding to the problem, the dairy industry moves tens of thousands of female cattle between states every week, Poulsen says, because the animals grow well as calves in hot, dry environments but produce more milk as mature cows in cooler regions. This movement of sick animals likely facilitated early spread between farms. The USDA has already moved to address this spread: as of April 29, it is requiring that lactating cows test negative for H5N1 before they can cross state lines. Controlling the spread of avian influenza without stopping the complex system of cow movement is a crucial balance, Poulsen says. “We can’t just turn off milk production, and we can’t turn off the supply chain of those cows,” he says. Testing and other monitoring strategies need to be strengthened even for cows staying in one place, however. “I think that we are a bit behind on the surveillance,” Davis says. In particular, she says she’d like to see cows undergo serological testing, which looks for antibodies in blood that are tailored to a specific pathogen and can signify past exposure to that pathogen. She also notes that existing milk-monitoring systems set up for food safety may offer opportunities for better tracking of H5N1, given the virus’s prevalence in milk. In addition, the same wastewater monitoring infrastructure that scientists developed to keep an eye on COVID is also offering insight on where avian influenza is striking dairy cows, as well as other animal infections. Tackling avian influenza in dairy animals poses additional logistical complications. Compared with the poultry industry, the dairy industry is more fragmented, Davis says: the latter is made up of many independent farms rather than large, centralized companies that hire farmers on contract. Another distinction between the industries is that the government has an indemnification system that reimburses poultry farmers for birds that are culled to keep the disease from spreading. By contrast, experts say that killing cows wouldn’t help stem the dairy outbreak because of the animals’ lower infection rate and milder symptoms. Yeiser Stepp isn’t sure yet what financial strategy makes the most sense for the farmers who work with her. She’s also a herd owner who has cows based in states that are not reporting H5N1 cases, and she says her biggest concern is about the fees for calling a vet out to the farm more regularly. Rodriguez says that at present he thinks the priority needs to be strengthening biosecurity measures that can protect both cows and the humans who care for them. Existing recommendations hold that workers should be wearing gloves during the milking process, but doubling down on this guideline and adding additional personal protective equipment such as disposable coveralls, face shields, masks and goggles are important steps for keeping the virus out of humans. Currently, dairy workers are among the people who are most at risk of avian influenza, and many are disempowered migrant workers who face structural barriers to accessing health care. To determine what comes next, however, scientists need to pin down the outbreak’s many lingering unknowns, such as how the virus is spreading and how long cows remain infectious. “I think that biosecurity is the only thing that we can do right now, at least until we have more answers in terms of the dynamic of the virus,” Rodriguez says. Despite the stumbles early in the response, Poulsen says, there’s still time to put an end to the dairy outbreak before it becomes a bigger issue for the industry as a whole or for the general population. “We have the best veterinarians and public health scientists in the world,” he says. “We can do it.

{"id": "538", "title": "How Poor Tracking of Bird Flu Leaves Dairy Workers at Risk", "date": "2024-05-09", "fulltext": "Farmworkers have been exposed to milk infected with the bird flu virus. But there has been virtually no testing on farms, and health officials know little about who may be infected. Even as it has become increasingly clear that the bird flu outbreak on the nation’s dairy farms began months earlier and is probably much more widespread than previously thought, federal authorities have emphasized that the virus poses little risk to humans. Yet there is a group of people who are at high risk for infection: the estimated 100,000 men and women who work on those farms. There has been no widespread testing to see how many may be infected. None have been vaccinated against bird flu. That leaves the workers and their families vulnerable to a poorly tracked pathogen. And it poses broader public health risks. If the virus were to find its way into the wider population, experts say, dairy workers would be a likely route. “We have no idea if this virus is going to evolve to become a pandemic strain, but we know today that farmworkers are being exposed, and we have good reasons to think that they are getting sick,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. A majority of dairy farmworkers are Spanish-speaking immigrants, often undocumented, who may not have paid sick leave or be protected by occupational safety laws. They may lack access to medical providers, and their employers can be intolerant of absences. “This sector of workers is not only at the very, very highest risk because they’re having that direct, intimate contact with discharge, raw milk, with infected animals, but they’re also at the very, very highest level of risk in terms of having no social safety net,” said Elizabeth Strater, an organizer with United Farm Workers. Interviews with more than three dozen federal and state officials, public health experts, farmers and workers’ organizations show how little is known about what’s occurring on farms: how many workers may be affected, how the virus is evolving and how it is spreading among cows. So far, the virus, called H5N1, has been detected in cattle herds in nine states. While veterinarians have said there are unconfirmed reports of farmworkers with flulike symptoms, only 30 have been tested as of Wednesday. Barring extraordinary circumstances, state and federal health officials do not have the authority to demand access to farms. Instead, the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture are testing milk and ground beef on grocery shelves for the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is waiting for infected people to show up at clinics. “Do you want to find out about a virus when it’s spreading among people so much that they are coming into emergency rooms in hordes, or do you want to catch it on the farms so you can treat the people and slow the spread?” said Rick Bright, the chief executive of Bright Global Health, which focuses on responses to public health emergencies. A tangled regulatory system complicates the situation, said Dr. Jay Varma, who served in the C.D.C.’s food-borne diseases branch and oversaw food safety as a deputy commissioner at New York City’s health department. The agriculture department regulates large commercial farms and can mandate testing of animals — although it has not yet done so — but not of farmworkers. The department “doesn’t ever want to be in a position where it has to declare that food supply from the U.S. is unsafe, because some of those food products may be exported to other countries and that can have a huge economic impact,” Dr. Varma said. The C.D.C. has authority over ports of entry into the United States, but domestically the agency needs state approval to do much of its work. The F.D.A., Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and Citizenship and Immigration Services all have roles to play, but each has its bureaucratic layers and institutional culture. This patchwork can be an impediment during a disease outbreak, some experts said. In 2009, the response to a cluster of bacterial infections in a salami product was delayed because the Department of Agriculture regulated the meat, the F.D.A. was responsible for the cracked black pepper that coated it and the C.D.C. was in charge of investigating the people who became ill. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the C.D.C., dismissed the notion that bureaucracy was an obstacle as “overly simplistic,” and said the agencies responding to the outbreak talk numerous times a day to coordinate their activities and to work with state partners. “This stuff is hard,” he said. But “we’re working together on this because we have common goals.” Wary of scrutiny, very few farms have granted entry to health officials. Dairies found to have infected herds could see as much as a 20 percent dip in income. Farmers already face stagnant milk prices and high feed and transportation costs. Because of the relatively small number of cases — 26 affected herds out of some 26,000 nationwide and one infected farmworker — some farmers see the bird flu as a distant threat. Even those who support public health efforts are hesitant to let federal officials on their properties. Jason Schmidt owns Grazing Plains Farm in Whitewater, Kan., “an itty bitty little” farm as he refers to it, with 70 dairy cows he raises himself. Mr. Schmidt said he supported the government’s public health role, but would not want officials traipsing around his farm. If he were to see a sick cow, “I sure hope I’d report it,” he said. “But there’s that little devil on my shoulder saying, ‘Just keep quiet and divert that milk from those sick cows and put that down the drain and don’t say anything.’” Mitch Breunig, who owns Mystic Valley Dairy in Sauk City, Wis., said that if his veterinarian determined it was “prudent,” he would test a cow with bird flu symptoms, but “I really don’t want the C.D.C. coming to my farm.” So far, the outbreak has affected not small farms, but the giant dairies that increasingly dominate the industry and often rely on migrant workers. The owners of such farms “don’t care about our health, they just care that we do our jobs,” said Luis Jimenez, who works on a dairy in upstate New York and founded a group supporting undocumented immigrant farmworkers. “Their cows’ health is more important to them than their workers,” he added. Farms are often geographically remote, and the workers — who sometimes live on site — may not have transportation to reach medical care. And to many, the kinds of symptoms ascribed to bird flu infection may not seem particularly urgent. “We’re talking about an eye infection or a cough, and these are people who have back aches and arm aches and broken this and that,” said Monica Schoch-Spana, a medical anthropologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Even without access to farms, health officials could support migrant workers in other settings, advocates noted. “They go to church, they go to stores, they go to restaurants, and there are other ways to reach them,” said Amy Liebman, a program officer at the Migrant Clinicians Network. To make testing more attractive, community centers could offer other health care services, legal assistance and food, and educate workers on ways they can protect themselves and their families, Ms. Liebman said. Dr. Shah said the C.D.C. was working with veterinarians and organizations like the Migrant Clinicians Network to reach farmworkers. “We, too, would like to offer testing to more workers,” he said. On Monday, Dr. Shah asked that state health officials provide goggles, face shields and gloves to farmworkers, and collaborate with trusted community organizations to educate them on the importance of the gear in preventing infection. Despite the risks to their health, farmworkers are not required to wear protective equipment. “It’s not a mandate, no one is being forced to do anything here,” Dr. Shah said. But the nature of farm work and the settings in which it is done — milk parlors that quickly render masks wet and useless, for example — can make wearing protective equipment challenging. A few states have taken steps to contain the outbreak, with limited success. Texas offered to provide protective gear to dairies, but only four came forward, according to a spokesman for the state’s health department. Idaho has also offered protective equipment since the outbreak’s onset, but no farms have taken up the offer. Idaho health officials have not asked to go onto farms “for privacy and biosecurity reasons,” Dr. Christine Hahn, the state epidemiologist, said in an email, although they helped to test one farmworker for the infection. Michigan is prohibiting exhibition of dairy cows and poultry until the outbreak has subsided. The state does not require testing of cows or farmworkers. The current situation has shown that dairy farms may seed new outbreaks that quickly spread, as has long been the case on poultry and pig farms, several experts said. “If you had to hide a novel virus emergence in the United States, one of the best places to hide it would be in animal workers in rural America,” said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Surveillance of those workers is “not nearly as strong as we might see for other population groups,” he said. To build surveillance networks that include farmworkers and their families, federal, state and local agencies will have to first establish trust, said Dr. Andrew Bowman, a veterinary epidemiologist at Ohio State University. “If you look at the influenza surveillance we've done in swine, that didn't happen overnight,” Dr. Bowman said. “That took a decade to build.” While surveillance is important, some experts cautioned against testing farmworkers without first catering to their needs. “If we prepare to collect information that's only going to benefit others and not necessarily directly protect them, I just think that's a very hard thing to do ethically,” Dr. Nuzzo said.

{"id": "539", "title": "Cows have human flu receptors, study shows, raising stakes on bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle", "date": "2024-05-09", "fulltext": "(CNN) - In early March, Dr. Barb Petersen, a large-animal vet in Texas, began getting calls from the dairy farms she works with in the Panhandle. Workers there were seeing a lot of cows with mastitis, an infection of the udder. Their milk was thickened and discolored, and it couldn't be explained by any of the usual suspects such as bacteria or tissue damage. Several more dairies called. One owner told her he thought his farm had 'whatever is going around, and half of my pets have died,' indicating that the contagion had moved beyond cattle. After running a battery of tests and ruling out every cause she could think of, Petersen sent samples from sick and dead animals to the Texas A&M state veterinary lab and to friends and colleagues at Iowa State University. What they found - loads of the H5N1 influenza virus - has rocked the dairy industry and put public health officials around the world on alert. It also created an urgent scientific to-do list. One of the first questions that needed to be answered was how the virus was infecting cows in the first place. Researchers in the US and Denmark took on that task. Their findings, published as a preprint study, show that cows have the same receptors for flu viruses as humans and birds. Scientists fear that cows could be mixing bowls - hosts that help the virus learn to better spread between people. Such an event, while rare, experts say, could put us on the path to another pandemic. Bird flu tries out new hosts For years, H5N1, or highly pathogenic avian influenza, has been primarily confined to the bird population, but it has recently begun to infect a growing number of mammals, suggesting that the virus might be adapting and moving closer to becoming a human pathogen. Avian flu viruses have decimated commercial poultry flocks in the US, and because pigs are known to catch bird flu viruses, swine have been closely monitored for signs of infection - but cows weren't on anyone's radar as potential hosts. Since late March, 42 infected herds have been found in nine states, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Only one person has been found to be infected with H5N1 after contact with infected cows, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health is low, although it is working with states to monitor people with animal exposures. 'The finding in cattle has been so different,' said Dr. Lars Larsen, a professor of veterinary clinical microbiology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. In mammals, influenza typically infects the lungs. In cats, it can also infect the brain. 'Here we see an enormous amount of virus in the mammary and in the milk,' Larsen said. Larsen said the concentration of H5N1 viruses in the milk of infected cows is 1,000 times higher than typically seen in infected birds. He said he and his colleagues calculated that even if the milk from a single infected cow were diluted in 1,000 tons of milk, scientists would still be able to pick up traces of the virus in lab tests. Tests by the US Food and Drug Administration found inert fragments of genetic material from the H5N1 virus in about 1 out of 5 samples of milk purchased on grocery store shelves, raising questions about how the virus had become so widespread. Researchers confirmed in later tests that the pasteurized milk it tested wasn't infectious and couldn't make anyone sick. That hasn't stopped the outbreak from rattling more than a few nerves. There's big money riding on the health of cows. Milk and dairy products were the fourth largest agricultural commodity in the US in terms of cash receipts in 2022, according to the USDA's economic research service. Sales of cattle and calves were the second largest commodity. How viruses break into cells Viruses need a way to hack into cells. For the virus that causes Covid-19, the key is a receptor called ACE2. For flu viruses, it's a sugar molecule that sticks up from the surface of cells called a sialic acid. Different animals carry different forms, or shapes, of sialic acids. Birds have sialic acid receptors that are slightly different shapes from than the ones humans have in their upper respiratory tracts. If you hold your index finger straight up, that's kind of what a bird's sialic acid receptor looks like, says Dr. Andy Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist and immunologist at Johns Hopkins University. If you bend your finger at the knuckle into an upside-down L, that's what human sialic acid receptor looks like. Flu viruses tend to prefer to bind to one shape over the other, he said. Researchers think this may be one reason why H5N1, which originated in birds, hasn't been shown to spread efficiently between people. Until recently, nobody knew what kind of sialic acid receptors cows had, because it was believed that they didn't catch A-strain flu viruses like H5N1. Larsen and his colleagues in the US and Denmark took tissue samples from the lungs, windpipes, brains and mammary glands of calves and cows and stained them with compounds that they knew would attach to different kinds of sialic acid receptors. They sliced the stained tissues very thinly and peered at them under a microscope. What they saw was surprising: The tiny milk-producing sacs of the udder, called alveoli, were brimming with sialic acid receptors, and they had both the kind of receptors associated with birds and those that are more common in people. Almost every cell they looked at contained both types of receptors, said lead study author Dr. Charlotte Kristensen, a postdoctoral researcher in veterinary pathology at the University of Copenhagen. That finding has raised concern because one way flu viruses change and evolve is by swapping pieces of their genetic material with other flu viruses. This process, called reassortment, requires that a cell be infected with two different flu viruses at the same time. 'If you get both viruses in the same cell at the same time, you can essentially get hybrid viruses coming out of it,' said study author Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. In order to be infected simultaneously with two flu viruses - a bird flu virus and a human flu virus - a cell would need to have both kinds of sialic acid receptors, which cows do, something that wasn't known before this study. 'I think this is probably a pretty rare event,' said Webby, who has been studying the H5N1 virus for 25 years. In order for something like that to happen, a cow infected with the bird flu virus would need to pick up a different flu strain from an infected human. Currently, human flu infections are low across the country and dropping as flu season winds down, making the possibility of something like this happening even more remote. Still, it's not unheard-of. Pigs also have both human and bird sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tracts, and flu infections in pigs have been known to spark pandemic viruses. The 2009 pandemic caused by H1N1 influenza, for example, is believed to have started in pigs in Mexico when the virus reassorted to become one that was able to spread quickly between people. Another way the bird flu virus could change in cows, Webby says, is more gradual - and more common. Each time a virus copies itself, it makes mistakes. Sometimes, those mistakes make the virus less potent and hurt its chances of survival, but in other instances, they're happy accidents - at least for the virus. If a bird flu virus happened to change in a way that made it able to bind more easily to the human-type sialic acid receptors in cows, it could gain a survival advantage: the ability to infect more cells and more types of animals, like humans. Viruses can shift and drift Reassortment would be a big shift in the evolution of the virus, but the gradual passage of the virus through new hosts could also result in a change to the virus' genome by evolutionary drift. Either way, it's not good news, said Dr. Sam Scarpino, a computational biologist and director of AI and life sciences at Northeastern University. 'We now have a piece of data that suggests the risk profile is higher,' said Scarpino, who was not involved in the new study. He notes that this is early research. It needs to be confirmed by a different group of researchers, and it was published quickly as a preprint ahead of scrutiny by outside experts. But he said the findings are also important because no one had really looked to at the susceptibility of cow tissues to influenza A viruses before. 'This is the first that I'm aware of. It doesn't mean there isn't another one out there, but a number of us looked at it pretty carefully and didn't find any,' he said. Kristensen said the researchers also couldn't find any prior research on it, which is why they did the study. 'We just felt that, given the situation, that we should go out with these results as fast as possible,' Larsen said. Other experts said that although there are more dots to connect, the study clearly raises the level of alert. 'I think we now have more than enough information to conclude that what has to happen is, we need to stop transmission in dairy cattle,' Scarpino said. 'We need to increase the kinds of protection that are mandated for workers that are in close contact with cows and milk products and significantly increase the funding that's going into understanding influenza and in cows, because there's just a huge amount that we don't know that we need to learn very quickly.'", "media_outlet": "CNN", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "Scientists fear that cows could be mixing bowls - hosts that help the virus learn to better spread between people.

{"id": "540", "title": "Opinion: H5N1 communication has been strictly for the birds. Didn� the federal government learn anything from Covid?", "date": "2024-05-09", "fulltext": "When it comes to federal agencies communicating to the public about H5N1 bird flu, it feels like a classic case of Yogi Berra's déjà vu all over again. In the wake of pointed criticism about its failure to release new information about the growing H5N1 outbreak in livestock, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on April 21—four weeks after the outbreak first hit the media—data dumped genetic information from cattle on its public database. The posted material further confused the public. Two weeks later on May 1, USDA scientists published a preprint of a scientific paper based on this data, which has just muddled things further. While this report maintains that the spread of H5N1 to cattle is limited to a few herds, it also suggests that USDA sat on its data for more than a month and that the virus was mutating fairly rapidly in animals. A comprehensive article in STAT on May 3 about the USDA’s latest H5N1 communications quotes a scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying that the new findings did not raise any immediate red flags for increased risk to human health. Related: WHO’s top scientist learned a hard lesson about H5N1 two decades ago: Stopping it takes more than biology. The Food and Drug Administration, after maintaining a discreet silence on the subject of H5N1 bird flu, finally issued a public communication on April 24 reassuring the public that America’s supply of pasteurized milk was safe to consume and everything was OK even though fragments of the H5N1 virus have been detected in milk. Yet a May 1 New York Times guest essay by Johns Hopkins researchers stated bluntly that dairy workers, most of whom do not speak English and many of whom are undocumented, are at high risk of infection. A similar thread of ineffective and unhelpful communications emerged at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. Inconsistent and inadequate communication about the emerging threat diminished trust in government agencies and contributed to an overall poor response to the pandemic. But the USDA, CDC, and FDA seem to have forgotten the consequences of failing to admit any uncertainty in the face of a potentially high-risk pathogen. They have also failed to account for the threat of disinformation, in this case primarily from promoters of raw milk products, who are to pasteurization what Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is to vaccines. The same failures occurred two decades ago, when so-called mad-cow disease emerged and one of us strongly advised the government to be more forthcoming in reporting the status of surveillance and the most current estimated threat level to human beings. As health communication specialists, we think that the federal government is once again failing to follow best practices when it comes to communicating transparently about an uncertain, potentially high-risk situation. To be sure, the government needs to improve its capability to manage an array of other urgent issues surrounding H5N1, including surprisingly inadequate surveillance, limited testing capacity, and a dangerous lack of access to health care in the rural regions that are most likely to be initially affected if H5N1 spills over into humans. But failure to communicate systematically in the present environment is an equally urgent challenge. During a crisis, government communications are often cited as one of the key factors in successful emergency response. Compassion, correctness, and credibility are central. Compassion: government communications must empathize with what people are experiencing, including the sacrifices many of them must make. Correctness: communication should always be up front and transparent. Credibility: the flow of information should be consistent and reliable. Related: CDC’s top flu scientist says the risk to the public from H5N1 is low, but she isn’t sleeping well. Here’s why. When government agencies communicate during a crisis, they often focus almost exclusively on what to communicate. We believe there needs to be equal emphasis on when and how to communicate. Public response to the H5N1 situation suggests that people are dismayed at what appears to be almost random announcements with unexplained silence in between. That’s a problem because plenty of third-party disinformation fills those gaps. To establish consistent, trustworthy, and reliable communication, government agencies need to lay out when they will communicate about H5N1, explain when they will not, and stick to the plan. We offer three suggestions to help them do this: Create a comprehensive intragovernmental communication plan based on multiple scenarios. It’s abundantly clear that no one knows for sure where bird flu is heading: Will it be confined to cattle, or will it spread to other species, including humans? Government agencies need to be prepared to communicate thoroughly and consistently, and plans for several scenarios should be laid out in detail now. Make public the government’s planned strategy for H5N1 communication. Government agencies should provide people with a rough schedule of when they should expect to be updated. This will build trust and confidence in government actors. If an update is not available at one of the planned times, spokespersons should be prepared to say so and to explain why. The worst possible scenario is to appear inconsistent and unpredictable. Coordinate communication across agencies on a daily basis, emphasizing trustworthy, quality information. Few Americans know the jurisdiction of various agencies. Milk comes from cows, so is the Food and Drug Administration in charge or the U.S. Department of Agriculture? Make it clear from the beginning who is doing what and who will be communicating on what aspect of the response. In the case of H5N1 bird flu, the USDA, FDA, and CDC should establish a joint H5N1 communication team and engage other credible stakeholders including industry scientists, employers, retailers, the media, and others so information is presented consistently and understandably to audiences of all types. Appointing a single highly competent and credible spokesperson, such as Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was during the first years of the HIV/AIDS crisis, might make sense. Communication is not an afterthought. It is absolutely central to emergency response and can be a deciding factor in maintaining control over the effects of an outbreak.", "media_outlet": "STAT", "high_rate_2": "no", "nuance_2": "no", "comments": null, "feedback_2": "Nuance not assigned; set to manual.", "error": "no", "processed": "yes", "affirm_transmissible_statement_1": "It’s abundantly clear that no one knows for sure where bird flu is heading: Will it be confined to cattle, or will it spread to other species, including humans?", "affirm_transmissible_statement_2": "To be sure, the government needs to improve its capability to manage an array of other urgent issues surrounding H5N1, including surprisingly inadequate surveillance, limited testing capacity, and a dangerous lack of access to health care in the rural regions that are most likely to be initially affected if H5N1 spills over into humans.", "affirm_transmissible_count": 2, "affirm_why_statement_1": "it also suggests that USDA sat on its data for more than a month and that the virus was mutating fairly rapidly in animals.", "affirm_why_statement_2": "Will it be confined to cattle, or will it spread to other species, including humans?", "affirm_why_count": 2, "affirm_keywords_statement_1": "A similar thread of ineffective and unhelpful communications emerged at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020.", "affirm_keywords_statement_2": "Inconsistent and inadequate communication about the emerging threat diminished trust in government agencies and contributed to an overall poor response to the pandemic.", "affirm_keywords_count": 2, "deny_transmissible_count": 0, "deny_why_statement_1": "A comprehensive article in STAT on May 3 about the USDA’s latest H5N1 communications quotes a scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying that the new findings did not raise any immediate red flags for increased risk to human health.", "deny_why_statement_2": "CDC’s top flu scientist says the risk to the public from H5N1 is low, but she isn’t sleeping well.
